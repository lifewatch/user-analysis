(Malacostraca: Leptostraca) occurs along the southern coasts of Korea. The specimens were collected by light traps in harbors where the bottom consisted of fine sand with some algal mats. The new taxon is distinguished from all other known species of Nebalia by the following characteristics: a rectangular compound eye with two to three small distal lobes; an antennular flagellum that is clearly shorter than the peduncle, with up to 10 articles; the fourth article of the antennular peduncle has only two distal thick setae; the antennular scale is nearly oval with a length that is 1.8 times the width; the second article of the mandibular palp has three distally plumose setae; pleonites 3 to 7 have rounded denticles along their posterior dorsal margins; and the protopod of pleopod 4 lacks serration along the posterior margin. We discuss sexual dimorphism in the genus Nebalia and propose the necessity of describing male traits when reporting new species. We also provide partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene from the new species that can be used as a molecular diagnostic characteristic."

Here we undertake a synthesis of present knowledge of biodiversity in European Seas and identify remaining challenges that prevent sustainable management of marine biodiversity in one of the most exploited continents of the globe. Our analysis demonstrates that changes in faunal standing stock with depth depends on the size of the fauna, with macrofaunal abundance only declining with increasing water depth below 1000 m, whilst there was no obvious decrease in meiofauna with increasing depth. Species richness was highly variable for both deep water macro- and meio- fauna along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Nematode biodiversity decreased from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean whilst latitudinal related biodiversity patterns were similar for both faunal groups investigated, suggesting that the same environmental drivers were influencing the fauna. While climate change and habitat degradation are the most frequently implicated stressors affecting biodiversity throughout European Seas, quantitative understanding, both at individual and cumulative/synergistic level, of their influences are often lacking. Full identification and quantification of species, in even a single marine habitat, remains a distant goal, as we lack integrated data-sets to quantify these. While the importance of safeguarding marine biodiversity is recognised by policy makers, the lack of advanced understanding of species diversity and of a full survey of any single habitat raises huge challenges in quantifying change, and facilitating/prioritising habitat/ecosystem protection. Our study highlights a pressing requirement for more complete biodiversity surveys to be undertaken within contrasting habitats, together with investigations in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning links and identification of separate and synergistic/cumulative human-induced impacts on biodiversity."

Stock assessment of both tropical and temperate tuna strongly leans on the catch statistics derived from pelagic longline ?sheries. However, the role of the spatial distribution of catches of tuna and bycatch species over the gear, that can affect the estimated tuna abundance, is still neglected. In this study, we analyzed data obtained from 147 instrumented pelagic longline sets equipped with hook timers and temperature depth recorders to characterize the distribution of hooking contacts and success at a fine temporal and spatial scale. Scientific surveys were carried out in the Central-South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia), targeting tropical (Thunnus albacares, T. obesus) and temperate (T. alalunga) tuna. Data analysis based on spatial point processes and stochastic modeling demonstrate the presence of spatio-temporal clusters for both hooking contacts and hooking success. The comparative analysis of the observed spatio-temporal patterns for different oceanographic zones revealed the persistent structure of the clusters, suggesting that they are neither related to local environmental conditions nor to the spatial distribution of preys.

238170	2013	AS	A bioturbation classification of European marine infaunal invertebrates	"Bioturbation, the biogenic modification of sediments through particle reworking and burrow ventilation, is a key mediator of many important geochemical processes in marine systems. In situ quantification of bioturbation can be achieved in a myriad of ways, requiring expert knowledge, technology, and resources not always available, and not feasible in some settings. Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BP<sub>c</sub>). This index can be calculated from inventories of species, abundance and biomass data (routinely available for many systems), and a functional classification of organism traits associated with sediment mixing (less available). Presently, however, there is no agreed standard categorization for the reworking mode and mobility of benthic species. Based on information from the literature and expert opinion, we provide a functional classification for 1033 benthic invertebrate species from the northwest European continental shelf, as a tool to enable the standardized calculation of BP<sub>c</sub> in the region. Future uses of this classification table will increase the comparability and utility of large-scale assessments of ecosystem processes and functioning influenced by bioturbation (e.g., to support legislation). The key strengths, assumptions, and limitations of BP<sub>c</sub> as a metric are critically reviewed, offering guidelines for its calculation and application."

238388	2013	AS	The importance of different spatial scales in determining structural and functional characteristics of deep-sea infauna communities	"The urge to understand spatial distributions of species and communities and their causative processes has continuously instigated the development and testing of conceptual models in spatial ecology. For the deep sea, there is evidence that structural and functional characteristics of benthic communities are regulated by a multitude of biotic and environmental processes that act in concert on different spatial scales, but the spatial patterns are poorly understood compared to those for terrestrial ecosystems. Deep-sea studies generally focus on very limited scale ranges, thereby impairing our understanding of which spatial scales and associated processes are most important in driving structural and functional diversity of communities. Here, we used an extensive integrated dataset of free-living nematodes from deep-sea sediments to unravel the importance of different spatial scales in determining benthic infauna communities. Multiple-factor multivariate permutational analyses were performed on different sets of community descriptors (structure, structural and functional diversity, standing stock). The different spatial scales investigated cover two margins in the northeast Atlantic, several submarine canyons/channel/slope areas, a bathymetrical range of 700-4300 m, different sampling locations at each station, and vertical sediment profiles. The results indicated that the most important spatial scale for structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability is the smallest one; infauna communities changed substantially more with differences between sediment depth layers than with differences associated to larger geographical or bathymetrical scales. Community structure differences were greatest between stations at both margins. Important regulating ecosystem processes and the scale on which they occur are discussed. The results imply that, if we are to improve our understanding of ecosystem patterns of deep-sea infauna and the relevant processes driving their structure, structural and functional diversity, and standing stock, we must pay particular attention to the small-scale heterogeneity or patchiness and the causative mechanisms acting on that scale."

Among the medicinal species, 19 species feature on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List and/or are CITES-listed (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). This highlights the need to assess the impacts of zootherapy in the context of marine biodiversity conservation. Conservation efforts should also be directed to unprotected species, whose medicinal use is widespread. In addition to biological aspects, economical and sociocultural factors influence the relationship between people and zootherapeutical resources. Therefore, studies bridging ecological, anthropological, and pharmacological aspects of the medicinal use of animals should be fostered.

The species has a broad range in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, although it is possible that small or isolated patches of suitable habitat may not be occupied due to restrictions on larval supply. Nephrops densities are related to the silt-clay content of sediments, with interactions between habitat quality and density indicating competition for resources. An analysis of density-size interactions across fishery functional management units (FUs) suggests that growth is suppressed at high densities due to competition (e. g. in the western Irish Sea), although recruitment dynamics or size-selective mortality may also shape the size structure of populations. Nephrops biomass available across FUs may be similar, reflecting a constant yield due to the inverse relationship between individual size and population density. Gaps in the understanding of Nephrops' ecology reflect uncertain ageing criteria, reliance on fisheries-dependent data and few if any undisturbed habitats in which to examine fisheries-independent interactions."

The upper tide level (UTL) and the low tide level (LTL) of both beaches were surveyed in January (austral summer) and June 2001 (austral winter) during low-spring tides, by collecting samples of nematodes and sediments. Differences in density between beaches, tidal level and seasons, and nematode community structure were investigated. Sediments from both beaches were composed of medium to very coarse sand. The highest nematode densities were found at the UTL, and significant differences between beaches, tidal levels and months were found. A total of 54 genera were found and the genera composition on both sheltered beaches was similar to other exposed worldwide sandy beaches. The density and structure of the nematode community at both beaches clearly varied along the spatial and temporal scales. Gravel percentage was the most important variable explaining the spatial distribution of the nematodes, determining the four sub-communities; this suggests that the sediment characteristics influence the nematode community, rather than physical hydrodynamic forces. Temperature and salinity were suggested to be important variables affecting the temporal variation."	"Maria, T.F.; Paiva, P.; Vanreusel, A.; Esteves, A.M."	WOS:000321393500020

227406	2013	AS	"Invisible catch: A century of bycatch and unreported removals in sea fisheries, Belgium 1929-2010"	"Publicly reported statistics on the production of fisheries refer to 'landings' as opposed to 'catch'. However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems must be based on total removals, so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. Total removals by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929 to 2010, were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. The reconstructed total removals on the BNS were estimated to be 55% higher than the 0.8 million t publicly reported over this period. Discards represent an average annual of 34% of the total removals on the BNS over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000s, approximately 50% of all Belgian removals from its EEZ are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (<12 m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical total removals for Belgium's sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives."

Estimated residency times within The Bahamas EEZ, where longlining and commercial trade of sharks is illegal, were generally high (mean = 68.2% of time). Sharks spent 99.7% of their time shallower than 200 m and did not exhibit differences in day and night mean depths. There was a positive correlation between daily sea surface temperature and mean depth occupied, suggesting possible behavioral thermoregulation. All individuals made short duration (mean = 13.06 minutes) dives into the mesopelagic zone (down to 1082 m and 7.75°C), which occurred significantly more often at night. Ascent rates during these dives were significantly slower than descent rates, suggesting that these dives are for foraging.

The integration of historical time series on the landings and value of landings of Belgian sea fisheries, by fishing area, allows for a spatial analysis of broad-scaled historical preference of different Belgian fisheries for specific fishing areas. It documents changes in the relative importance of fishing areas for the Belgian fisheries as well as changes in composition of landings from within fishing areas over 8 decades (1929-2009) and underlines the historical importance of the 'coastal waters' to the Belgian fisheries. Finally, qualitative and quantitative statements about the spatial dynamics of Belgian fisheries in published sources are validated and, where not supported by our data, challenged.

Irrespective of season and regions, Mytilus spp. was more C-13-depleted than M. balthica. delta C-13 values of M. balthica, but not those of Mytilus spp., were significantly correlated with SOM. These results are consistent with differences in feeding behavior of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica, as the two species are known as obligatory-suspension and facultative-deposit feeders, respectively. In contrast, no differences in the delta N-15 values of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica were found at individual stations, indicating the same trophic level of the two bivalves within the food webs. At some stations, irrespective of geographic location, both bivalves showed delta N-15 values up to 18-20 aEuro degrees. These were two trophic levels higher than those found at the other stations, indicating local and/or episodic eutrophic conditions, probably due to waste water discharge, and the effectiveness of both Mytilus spp. and M. balthica as bio-indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication. Overall, our results suggest that pathways of energy flow from OM pools to dominant bivalves is more related to local environmental conditions than to geographic regions across the European coastline. This has implications for food web studies along the Atlantic coast because most of the values are consistent over a large area and show no significant differences. Therefore, the present study can be used twofold for the determination of trophic baselines and for the correction of the trophic position of consumers higher up in the food web in the case of differences in waste water discharge."

234613	2013	AS	How many marine aliens in Europe?	"In the framework of the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN; http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/), an inventory of marine alien species in Europe was created by critically reviewing existing information in 34 global, European, regional and national databases. In total, 1369 marine alien species have been reported in the European seas (including 110 cryptogenic and 139 questionable species); this is a substantial increase from the 737 species previously reported in 2009 based on the DAISIE (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe; http://www.europe-aliens.org) dataset. Most of the reported species were invertebrates (63.3%), followed by chromists (13.7%), vertebrates (11.6%), and plants (10.1%). Mollusca is the most numerous phylum, followed by Arthropoda, Chordata, and Annelida. The countries with the highest reported numbers of marine alien species were Israel, Turkey, Italy, France, Egypt and Greece. A reporting bias is evident as efforts for monitoring and reporting alien species vary among countries."	"Katsanevakis, S.; Gatto, F.; Zenetos, A.; Cardoso, A.C."	\N

238219	2013	AS	Multiple spatial scale analyses provide new clues on patterns and drivers of deep-sea nematode diversity	"The deep sea is the largest biome of the biosphere. The knowledge of the spatial variability of deep-sea biodiversity is one of the main challenges of marine ecology and evolutionary biology. The choice of the observational spatial scale is assumed to play a key role for understanding processes structuring the deep-sea benthic communities and one of the most typical features of marine biodiversity distribution is the existence of bathymetric gradients. However, the analysis of biodiversity bathymetric gradients and the associated changes in species composition (beta diversity) typically compared large depth ranges (with intervals of 500 to 1000 or even 2000 m depth among sites). To test whether significant changes in alpha and beta diversity occur also at fine-scale bathymetric gradients (i.e., within few hundred-meter depth intervals) the variability of deep-sea nematode biodiversity and assemblage composition along a bathymetric transect (200-1200 m depth) with intervals of 200 m among sampling depths, was investigated. A hierarchical sampling strategy for the analysis of nematode species richness, beta diversity, functional (trophic) diversity, and related environmental variables, was used. The results indicate the lack of significant differences in taxonomic and functional diversity across sampling depths, but the presence of high beta diversity at all spatial scales investigated: between cores collected from the same box corer (on average 56%), among deployments at the same depth (58%), and between all sampling depths (62%). Such high beta diversity is influenced by the presence of small-scale patchiness in the deep sea and is also related to the large number of rare or very rare species (typically accounting for > 80% of total species richness). Moreover, the number of ubiquitous nematode species across all sampling depths is quite low (ca. 15%). Multiple regression analyses provide evidence that such patterns could be related to the different availability, composition and size spectra of food particles in the sediments. Additionally, though to a lesser extent, our results indicate, that selective predation can influence the nematode trophic composition. These findings suggest that a multiple scale analysis based on a nested sampling design could significantly improve our knowledge of bathymetric patterns of deepsea biodiversity and its drivers."

238689	2013	AM	Sustainability in coastal urban environment: identifying resources and users in Belgian case study areas	"This chapter presents an overview and analysis of the various aspects of resources and users in the two Belgian cases of Oostende and Brugge. These two case study areas lie next to each other and occupy around half of the total Belgian coastal zone. The Belgian coast is a densely populated and intensely used area due to its well-established infrastructure that makes the coast easily accessible for a broad (European) hinterland. Both the Belgian cases have a larger core and ring and are famous tourist attractions. While Brugge develops based on its two main pillars of multifunctional cargo port area and its touristic heritage, Oostende relies on strong beach tourism and a port as a passenger gateway. Both cases have witnessed their strong urbanization process decades ago and their development has become stabilized during the last decade. The economies rely more and more on commerce and service sector rather than traditional industrial activities. Agriculture has reduced to a marginal role, both in term of production and in term of employment. The major users include the local inhabitants, visitors, second-home owners, and various community groups. In Brugge, the port of Zeebrugge is one of the major users as it occupies a large area, which contains also valuable nature sites as well as important road, rail and waterway links to the hinterland. In Oostende, competition at the beachfront is one of the main issues. Generally ageing population, loss of agricultural lands, slight increase of mixed-use forest and nature areas, increase in port activities and urban sprawl are some of the trends observed in both cases. The scarcity of coastal space, and its contestation by a diversity of users for competing interests [mainly economic development and environmental protection] plays a pivotal role in generating a range of conflicts."

Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how WoRMS publishes online quality assured information on marine species.Within WoRMS, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management.By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of WoRMS, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management."

Although many studies have been conducted to their use and potential, only few authors have considered their use in the High Seas. In this paper, we investigate the effects of fish growth enhancing MPAs on the formation of regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) for highly migratory fish stocks. We argue that in absence of enforcement MPAs constitute a weakest-link public good, which can only be realized if everyone agrees. We combine this notion with a game theoretic model of RFMO formation to derive potentially stable RFMOs with and without MPAs. We find that MPAs generally increase the parameter range over which RFMOs are stable, and that they increase stability in a number of cases as compared to the case without MPAs. They do not necessarily induce a fully cooperative solution among all fishing nations. In summary, results of this paper suggest a positive role for MPAs in the High Seas."

They have a multitude of ecosystem functions, constitute an important habitat for a variety of fauna and flora and hold important economic, social and cultural value as prime recreational assets. Predictions on sea level rise, intensified storms, accelerated erosion and flood risk for the North Sea have led to the drafting of the Belgian Integrated Coastal Safety Plan. In order to protect the Belgian coastline against erosion and coastal flooding on a short and long term basis (up to 2050), the Belgian sandy beaches face a multitude of beach nourishment activities over the next years. This soft coastal defence measure safeguards the natural dynamics of the coast and has little impact on the beach ecology and tourism compared to other options. However, together with the multitude of human beach functions such as tourism and economic development, beach nourishment potentially threatens the natural balance of the beach and coastal ecosystem. As management of the coastal zone is clearly a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined, coastal management desperately needs ecological dimensions. Hence, solid and meaningful biological and ecological information is needed. Clear and user-friendly management tools are essential to guide integrative and ecosystem-based strategies to sustainably manage ongoing space-use activities at the Belgian beaches and coast."

The abundance of AOA and AOB was analysed using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization and (real-time) quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) targeting archaeal and bacterial amoA genes. Archaeal abundance was similar between sponge species, while bacterial abundance was higher in H. caerulea than in N. nodastrella and H. thielei. Q-PCR showed that AOA outnumbered AOB by a factor of 2 to 35, suggesting a larger role of AOA than of AOB in ammonia oxidation in sponges. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to analyse the taxonomic affiliation of the microbial community associated with these sponges. Archaeal and bacterial amoA genes were found in all 3 sponges. The structure of the phylogenetic trees in relation to temperature and sponge species was analysed using all published amoA sequences retrieved from sponges. Temperature was an important factor influencing the distribution of nitrifiers in sponges. Both archaeal and bacterial amoA sponge sequences tended to cluster with sequences retrieved from habitats of similar temperature. This is the first time that similarity in AOB diversity is described between distantly related species (H. thielei belonging to the class Demospongiae, and N. nodastrella to Hexactinellida). The results described here support the idea of a relatively uniform microbial community between distantly related sponges and suggest that temperature (rather than phylogenetic distance) is determining the diversity of AOA and AOB in sponges."

This paper provides a preliminary overview of the meiofauna and nematodes inhabiting coral sediments in the outer reef and lagoon habitats of the Maldives, and investigates their relationships with micro-habitat type. The abundance and community structure of the meiofauna and nematodes reveal significant differences between stations. Coral fragments and rubble from the outer reefs seem to act as a trap for the finest sediment, which might contribute to creating a heterogeneous micro-habitat suitable for both epifaunal (Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae genera) and sediment-dwelling (<em class=""a-plus-plus"">Tricoma</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Richtersia</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Ptycholaimellus</em> and <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Molgolaimus</em>) taxa. On the other side, the lagoon’s sediments are mainly colonized by dwelling taxa, probably due to the low-flow regime that enhances the deposition of organic matter and pelite fractions. A high level of diversity was recorded in both the habitats studied. Among the factors that probably determine the high diversity in the lagoon is the presence of small biogenic structures. These are characterized by a high degree of angularity, which might add more complexity to the habitat. The nematodes reveal an overlap in the taxonomic composition between the Maldives and other geographically distant areas, possibly supporting the existence of iso-communities that are typical of the coral degradation zone. Nematode trophic composition reflects differences in availability of food resources; epigrowth and non-selective deposit feeders are dominant in the lagoon, while selective deposit and epistrate feeders are dominant in the outer reefs."

Behavioural and evolutionary approaches of bioluminescence	"In this study, we investigated the functions of bioluminescence (the production of light by living organisms) in five brittle star species. Bioluminescence is a widespread phenomenon in the marine environment, and is especially abundant in the class Ophiuroidea. It is assumed that light in marine invertebrates mainly plays a role of defense against predation, and many mechanisms of defense have been proposed for brittle stars. We investigated the potential functions of startle effect (use of light to deter predator), use of light to advertise a predator that the prey is toxic (aposematic signal) and attraction of a secondary predator (function usually called ""burglar-alarm effect""). Predatory experiments, involving one or two predators from different trophic levels allowed us determining benefits of the light emission for several brittle star species. We clearly demonstrated that the three functions cited behind are used in brittle stars. It is clear now that brittle stars use a wide variety of defensive mechanisms involving light."

243809	2013	AMS	Echinoderm responses to variation in salinity	"Although Echinodermata is one of the only stenohaline phyla in the animal kingdom, several species show remarkable abilities to acclimate and survive in euryhaline habitats. The last comprehensive review of this topic was over 25 years ago and much work has been published since. These recent studies expand the field reports of species living in hyposaline environments and detail experimental research on the responses, physiological range, and limits of echinoderms to salinity challenges. I provide a brief review of the historical concepts and measures of salinity and relate this overview to the physiological and ecological studies on echinoderms. Many marine biologists are not aware that chemical oceanographers advocate abandoning today’s commonly used measure of salinity, ‘PSU’, in favour of absolute salinity (S<sub>A</sub>)—a return to the ppt (‰) metric. The literature survey reveals only one euryhaline-tolerant species in the Southern Hemisphere (there are 42 in the North) and more euryhaline species in the geologically older, brackish seas. The green sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</i>, is one of the most tolerant echinoids to hyposalinity. Different source populations have varying levels of acclimation and tolerance to hyposalinity. Experiments show that green urchins previously unexposed to hyposalinity experience a clear decrease in growth rates; however, this adverse effect is short lived. Green urchins already acclimated to hyposalinity can endure intense and repeated bouts and grow at the same rate of urchins not exposed. Promising future work on the physiological and cellular mechanisms of hyposalinity acclimation includes comparative studies of the role of heat shock proteins in the response to changing salinities."

Its recent spread into the Northern Hemisphere throughout the NE Atlantic gave the species the status of invasive. Together with its widespread distribution, reports on its wide variability (several distinct morphological characters, genetic discontinuities and also possible misidentifications) cast doubt on the taxonomic status of different populations of this species. This work, based on the observation, quantification and analysis of specific morphological characters in specimens collected at five different localities of South America and Antarctica, strongly indicates that there are two different species: <i>C. eumyota</i> from South America and <i>Corella antarctica</i> Sluiter, 1905) from Antarctica, which has been till now considered a junior synonym of the former. The species clearly differ in the arrangement of the gonadal ducts, the size of the larvae and the shape of the anus, among other characters. Morphological variation displays a defined, discrete grouping supporting a clear differentiation into two species.

The development of the status of 41 commercially exploited fish stocks from the North East Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea (FAO Area 27) was analysed together with the economic performance of the fleets exploiting those stocks. The analyses indicate that the exploitation status for many of the stocks has greatly improved during the last 10 years while the economic performance of the fleets over the same period has been highly variable. The main economic indicators (gross value added (GVA) and operating cash flow (OCF)) have gradually improved at a time when the general economic situation, which has a great influence on the markets, costs and purchase power, has worsened. While recognizing that much remains to be done to achieve the objective of the WSSD, the analyses indicate that actions implemented in the last decade under the CFP have led to an improvement in the status of many commercially important fish stocks and their fleets towards levels that are closer to those producing MSY."

228661	2013	M	"Belgian fisheries: ten decades, seven seas, forty species: Historical time-series to reconstruct landings, catches, fleet and fishing areas from 1900"	"Human activity has been impacting marine ecosystems for millennia, and fishing is most often seen as the cause of overexploitation and depletion of marine biological resources (Myers and Worm 2003, Salomon 2009). There is a wealth of recent studies illustrating how our perception of pristine conditions in the seas and oceans has shifted over generations. This is referred to as ‘Shifting Baselines’. A wide range of evidence about (pre) historical reference conditions and early baselines has increased the awareness on the limitations associated with the current scientific methods to determine appropriate reference conditions against which current targets for conservation and management are set, in particular for fisheries (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008). It is acknowledged that environmental reference conditions and targets must strive to integrate all available and relevant data and information for improved assessments, including incorporating historical data into conservation and management frameworks (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008, McClenachan et al. 2012). Historical data can contribute in explaining underlying cause-effect relations in changes in the ecosystems, potentially reveal information and knowledge from past conditions (Jackson et al. 2001), and help defining reference conditions and achievable targets for environmental management today. The present thesis focuses on quantitative data to extend the timeframe of current analyses on fisheries (landings, fleet dynamics, spatial dynamics, indexes of productivity of the fleet and impact of fishing) and on the reconstruction of historical timeseries to expand our knowledge on historical references for the Belgian sea fisheries. In achieving this, it intends to counter the concept of 'Shifting Baselines' applied to the Belgian Sea fisheries. The ‘Historical Fisheries Database’ (HiFiDatabase) is a product of this thesis. It is the result of a thorough search, rescue, inventory, standardization and integration of data for Belgium’s sea fisheries that were not available before in the public domain or were not available before in the appropriate format for redistribution. It is documented and stored in the Marine Data Archive of Flanders Marine Institute and is freely available for end-users. It contains a unique and substantial collection of time series with standardized species names, reporting units, fishing areas and ports of landing (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010b). It is a ‘living’ product in the sense that new, relevant, quality-controlled time-series can be added as they are discovered or produced. Considering the relative size of the fleet, the short coastline and the limited number of fish auctions and fishing ports in Belgium, it is fair to say that the present reconstruction of Belgian sea fisheries depicts a relatively complete picture of historical volume, value and composition of landings, fleet dynamics, fishing effort and spatial dynamics. The project and its methodology offer a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The reconstructed time-series indicate that, since the onset of systematic reporting mechanisms in Belgium in 1929, landings reported by the Belgian sea fisheries both in foreign and in Belgian ports amounted to 3.3 million tonnes (t). After a maximum of 80,000 t in 1947, annual landings declined steadily to only 26% of this peak by 2008 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The most important species over the observed period in terms of landings were cod (17% of all landings) and herring (16%), closely followed by plaice (14%), sole (8%), whiting (6%) and rays (6%). In terms of economic value and based on values corrected for inflation, sole (31%) and cod (15%) were the most valuable, closely followed by plaice (11%), brown shrimp (5%), rays (5%) and turbot (3%). Near to 73% of all landings originated from 5 of the 31 fishing areas. Twenty percent of all landings originated from the ‘coastal waters’, while these waters contributed nearly 60% of all landed pelagic species and 55% of all landed ‘molluscs and crustaceans’. The North Sea (south) and the Iceland Sea were next in importance with 17% and 16% of all landings respectively. The eastern and western part of the central North Sea, contributed each with approximately 10% of the total landings (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The Belgian fisheries have followed a development of 3 major successive exploitation phases in which 3 major target species or target species groups were exploited until events or processes triggered a transition to a new phase: a ‘herring’ period between 1929 and 1950, a ‘cod’ (and other gadoid and roundfish) period between 1950 and 1980 and a period marked by plaice/sole between 1980 and 2000 (and after). This successive exploitation of targeted species was also associated with exploited fishing grounds, successively the Coastal waters for herring, the Icelandic Sea for cod, the North Sea south and the North Sea central (east and west) for sole/plaice, later also complemented by the ‘western waters’ (English Channel, Bristol Channel, Irish Sea) for the flatfish fisheries. To understand and interpret the trends in landings and changes in target species (groups), it is crucial to look at trends and changes in the fishing fleet and the fishing sector inserted in a wider socio-economic and political context. In the present thesis work, a reconstruction was made of the fleet size (from 1830), tonnage (from 1842) and engine power (kW from 1912) of the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. The time-series show a 85% decrease in fleet size and a 5% decrease in overall engine power (kW) since WWII. This decrease was compensated by a 10-fold increase in average tonnage (GT) per vessel and a 6-fold increase in average engine power (kW) per vessel. In only 10 years time after WWII, the fleet size decreased from approximately 550 to 450 vessels in 1955 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). Between 1955 and 1970 major structural changes took place in the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. These changes were driven first by the shift in the main fishing activities towards Icelandic waters in the 1950s and in the early 1960s by the governmental subsidies for the purchase of new steel hulled medium-sized motor trawlers and the introduction of the beam-trawl (Poppe 1977, Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). This led to less but more powerful vessels: between 1960 and 1975 the fleet size declined from 430 to approximately 250 vessels (-42%). The decline in fleet size was exacerbated when Iceland demarcated its territorial waters from 12 nm to 50 nm in 1972 and when the presence of Belgian fishermen within the declared 200 nm EEZ of Icelandic waters became subject to a ‘phase-out’ in 1975 (Lescrauwaet et al. under review). As a consequence of the loss of the Icelandic waters towards 1980, Belgian vessels shifted their activities again towards the central part of the North Sea (Omey 1982) and - to a lesser extent - towards the English Channel, Bristol Channel, South and West Ireland and the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards specific programmes were oriented to the decommissioning of ships with the aim to reduce fleet capacity. In 2012, the Belgian commercial sea fishing fleet counted 86 ships, with a total engine capacity of 49,135 kW and gross tonnage of 15,326 GT (Roegiers et al. 2013). The reconstructed time-series suggest that total landings decreased with total fleet size and with total fishing effort. At the level of the Belgian fleet, the total number of days spent at sea decreased from approximately 91,800 days in 1938 to 15,100 days in 2010 (-84%). The landings (kg) per vessel per day at sea or per day fishing have doubled between 1938 and 2010. The time-series shows at least 4 successive events: a first event (1939-1945) marked by WWII and the increased landings of herring in coastal waters. The exceptionally high landings per unit of effort are partly explained by the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the North Sea during WWII combined with the effects of two strong year classes. The second period is situated in 1951-1955 and coincides with the steep increase in landings from Icelandic waters. Thirdly, an increase in landings is observed between 1960 and 1967, which coincides with the state subsidies to introduce the beam trawl firstly in shrimp vessels (1959-1960) and later for flatfish fisheries. A final conspicuous event concerns the period of increased levels of landings per vessel per day between 1977 and 1986. After standardization as landings per unit of installed power (LPUP) to account for the average increase (x6) of engine power per vessel, the landings have decreased by 74% from an average 1,3 t /installed kW in 1944-1947 to 0,38 t /installed kW in 2009-2010. Interestingly, the average price of landings (all species, all areas , all fisheries aggregated) is negatively correlated with the decreasing fishing effort and decrease in overall landings. This suggests that the Belgian sea fisheries compensated for the losses by targeting species that achieve better market prices. Although the LPUP are illustrative of the changes in the productivity of fisheries, they cannot be interpreted as a proxy of change in biomass of commercial fish stocks, because the Belgian fisheries have targeted different species and fishing areas over time. Trend analysis to study change in fish stocks must be conducted at the level of different métiers or fisheries, taking into account issues such as specificity and selectivity of gear, environmental conditions in the targeted fishing area, seasonality of fishing and behavior of target species. In the present thesis, a closer look was taken at the impact of sea fisheries. In a first part, a quantitative approach was taken to reconstruct total removals by Belgian sea fisheries by including the unreported and misreported landings of commercial and recreational fishing, as well as an estimation of discards. The methodology applied in this reconstruction can serve as a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The results are useful to inform current policy issues and societal challenges. This reconstruction covers 6 fisheries with historical or current importance for Belgium (Lescrauwaet et al. 2013). Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. During the WWII, the Belgian fisheries benefited a 10-fold increase in catches and 5-fold increase in LPUE of North Sea ‘Downs’ herring. In the present thesis, these increased catches were explained by the combined effects of a major increase in catch power after WWI, the effects of the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the central part of the North Sea and by the effects of strong pre-WWII year classes (Lescrauwaet et al. revised manuscript under review). A third subchapter focused on the otter trawl fishery in Icelandic waters targeting cod. This fishery was of great economic importance in Belgium but decreased with the ‘cod wars’ (1958 and 1972) coming finally to a complete end in 1996. While the decline in total landings from Icelandic waters started after Iceland expanded its EEZ in 1958, the fishing effort of the Belgian fleet continued to increase until a peak was reached in 1963. The results show that the decline in the Iceland cod stock was visible at different levels; the decrease in the proportional importance of cod in the overall landings, the 75% decrease in the LPUE (1946-1983), the decline in the proportion of ‘large’ fishes, and finally the decline or shift in the definition of a ‘large’ specimen. As a result of this thesis, unique data are presented on the trends in volume and composition of landings for the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS). The waters of the BNS are considered as the most important fishing area in terms of source of food for local population, but also as the most stable provider of food. The BNS and in particular the ecosystem of shallow underwater sandbanks is also important as (post)spawning and nursery area (Leloup and Gilis 1961, Gilis 1961, Leloup and Gilis 1965, Rabaut et.al 2007). The HiFiDatabase broadens the historical view on fisheries and serves as a basis for a range of potential research, management applications, and in support of policy-making. In particular, the time-series provide unique historical reference conditions of fishing in the Belgian part of the North Sea and a potential baseline for fisheries management in territorial waters or for the coastal fisheries. The latter is useful in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Habitat Directive and the proposal for Maritime Spatial Planning on the Belgian part of the North Sea. Finally in the present thesis work, important efforts were dedicated to approach the history of fisheries from different disciplines of work. The results underline the importance of collecting economic data, inventorying historical archives and historical legislation, historical economy and politics, in order to improve the interpretation and analysis of results. As advocated by the current integrated policies for the marine environment, both the challenge of the task and the richness of the results rely on a multidisciplinary approach.

It was therefore surprising that in a ciliate-contaminated experiment the growth rate of the phytoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi was significantly reduced. As U. marinum does not ingest E. huxleyi cells, their growth inhibition was probably caused by a toxin secreted by the ciliate, presumably a novel type of chemical interaction between ciliates and phytoplankton. A possible function of toxin secretion is to lyse algal cells that are too large for U. marinum to ingest, to increase dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and hence the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, the main food source of U. marinum. To test this hypothesis U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures was added to cultures of phytoplankton with different cell sizes. The presence of U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures showed an inhibiting growth effect and a negative effect on the physiology of all species tested although both effects were variable between species. Diatoms appeared less sensitive than non-diatom species. U. marinum acclimatization to phytoplankton led to stronger inhibiting effects, presumably from increased toxin production. Bacterial DGGE analysis of U. marinum cultures did not reveal known toxic bacteria that might account for the observed negative effects on the phytoplankton. Bacterial growth rates in an E. huxleyi culture increased when U. marinum filtrate had been added. In mixed cultures of bacteria, E. huxleyi and U. marinum, bacterial abundance first increased, then decreased due to ciliate predation. These findings support the hypothesis that toxin secretion by U. marinum increases non-prey phytoplankton-derived DOM and stimulates the growth of the bacterial prey."	"Schaafsma, F.L.; Peperzak, L."

233208	2013	M	Selective settlement of deep-sea and intertidal meiofauna - an experimental approach	"The cosmopolitan distribution of many meiofaunal organisms raises questions about the dispersal mechanisms of these animals. Their small size and the lack of a planktonic life stage in many taxa suggest that passive dispersal is the main factor determining distribution and colonization patterns. This study investigates the settling behaviour of meiofauna while descending in a water column. Two ex-situ settling experiments were conducted with (1) macrophyte associated meiofauna from an intertidal flat and (2) meiofauna of microbial mat sediments from the deep-sea Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV). Containers (126L) filled with sieved seawater were used as settling chambers and five different substrates, placed on the bottom of the vessels, were offered to the descending meiofaunal assemblage. The substrates used <i>Fucus spiralis</i>, sulfidic agar medium, bare agar and an empty Petri dish. For the deepsea experiment azoic sediment with algae, azoic sediment with bacteria, a sulfidic medium, azoic sediment and an empty Petri dish were used. The experiments were run for 12 hours. Significant differences in meiofaunal densities between the treatments were found in both experiments. Nematode and nauplius larvae showed fourfold higher densities in the Fucus treatment compared to the controls in the case of the intertidal experiment. Deep-sea nematodes and harpacticoid copepods in the sulfide treatment differed by a factor of five from all other treatments in terms of densities. Proportions of harpacticoid copepods were increased in the treatments compared to the reference sample. Nematode assemblages in the treatments showed no significant differences to the reference samples. These findings suggest that meiofauna can selectively settle once they are suspended in the water column and therefore actively contribute to their dispersal. In both experiments meiofauna was increased in substrates similar to their original habitat and proportional differences in harpacticoid copepods suggests a more efficient settlement compared to nematodes. The observed active settling behaviour may be very advantageous for the organisms in finding suitable habitat patches in heterogeneous environments. This study confirms previous research and adds important information to the understanding of meiofaunal dispersal mechanisms."	"Mevenkamp, L."	\N

Spatial strategies, it argues, are swiftly emerging through zoning mechanisms which territorialise the governance of ocean space. These strategies can supplement and disrupt more traditional temporal strategies, which facilitate speed and freedom of movement for commercial and military traffic. The article focusses on the US proposition to provide maritime security sector reform to African coastal states as a form of temporal strategy designed to shape new zoning practices in favour of freedom of movement. The paper concludes by arguing that the US strategy implies a policing approach that generates maritime surveillance capacities along land–sea lanes of communication. It contrasts this surface form of knowledge with the need for African coastal states to generate the sort of oceanographic data presently undergirding the emerging blue economies of Europe."

247740	2013	M	Meiofauna associated with seagrasses at natural CO<sub>2</sub> seeps in the Mediterranean Sea	"Due to the elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) level in the atmosphere, safe and effective carbon capture and storage methods are gaining more interest. The risks associated with storage and potential leakages for the marine environment are, however, largely unknown. CO2 release from sub-seabed reservoirs will have the greatest impact on the marine organisms living in or near the sea bottom. Areas where CO2 of volcanic origin is leaking from the seabed since centuries provide natural laboratories to study the long-term effects of high CO2 concentrations and subsequent seawater acidification. This study focused on the effects these environmental conditions have on meiofauna, and more particular on the community composition and diversity of the most two abundant taxa, i.e. nematodes and copepods. Samples were collected at natural CO2 seeps in Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows near Panarea Island. In conjunction, a colonisation experiment with seagrass mimics was also carried out to look into the short-term effects of CO2 leakage. Our observations indicated no significant differences in meiofauna densities between CO2 impacted and non-impacted sites either on natural seagrass leaves, shoots or seagrass mimics. The only difference in meiofauna diversity was observed on natural seagrass shoots. On natural leaves, a shift in dominant harpacticoid species was found, however, community structure did not significantly differ. On the natural seagrass shoots, on the other hand, nematode communities showed a significant change in community structure and species dominance. The short-term colonisation experiment on seagrass mimics showed changes in the harpacticoid community structure at the seepage site; while the nematode community structure, showed no difference, only a change in species dominance was observed. In general, a rather remarkable lack of strong meiofaunal response to the reduced pH may be depended on indirect consequences of CO2 leakage, such as increased seagrass productivity, seasonal organic matter input and reduced macrofaunal predation, in addition to the species specific reactions to environmental disturbance. Since similar research has not been carried out in the shallow-water environment before, further studies are suggested to gain better knowledge of the adaption of meiofauna to the low pH/high CO2 world.

Out of a total of 336 protected areas identified in Brazilian coastal and marine areas, the North Platform has the largest protected area, but the ecosystem with the largest number of protected area, predominantly sustainable areas, was the East Coast followed by the South Platform. One of the reasons the eastern coast of Brazil to have more protected areas is the fact that there is a largest amount of coral reefs. Additionally there was political opportunities for the creation of protected areas for sustainable use. The coastal region of Brazil has achieved the goal proposed by the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity – 7, but only then through the category V of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which is not the best efficient means of conserving resources. The goal for marine conservation shows only the area above the recommended under protection in North Platform. The Marine portion of the East Coast and the South Platform has few protected areas, regardless of category management. We consider the coastal region the range of 12 nautical miles from baselines determined in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As for the number of strategies permitted by law and used for the conservation of coastal and marine systems, coastal systems show a higher number when compared with the marine system. We suggest that the Brazilian government should specify strategies for the protection of marine systems and expand the protected areas of all Large Marine Ecosystems."

The genus <em>Scaphander</em> is a group of predominantly deep-sea, infaunal cephalaspids with about 40% of its species (eight) occurring on the Atlantic Ocean. They are carnivorous and have a unique digestive system with a large, strongly muscularized gizzard containing three sizable and heavily calcified plates. This work aims to describe the diet of <em>Scaphander</em>, to evaluate if there is a functional relation between the anatomy of the digestive tract and exploitation of novel food resources, and to assess if dietary specialization may have played a role in the diversification of the Atlantic species of <em>Scaphander</em>. Gut contents were studied from 31 specimens representing seven of the Atlantic species using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The chemical composition of the gizzard plates was analysed by X-ray microanalysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Foraminiferans, including agglutinating forms, were shown to be the most important food item for <em>Scaphander</em>; bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, and polychaetes with calcareous tubes were also found to form part of the diet. The gizzard plates were shown to consist of a phosphate-rich amorphous component and a crystalline component identified as fluorite (hardness 4; Moh's scale). It is suggested that the ability of <em>Scaphander</em> gastropods to prey upon organisms with hard tests, particularly agglutinating foraminiferans, is not only due to the hardness of the gizzard plates but to the cumulative effect of shape and hardness of the gizzard plates and relative size of the gizzard and associated musculature. No interspecific differences were found in the diet and morphology of the digestive tract, indicating that dietary specialization probably has not played a significant role in the diversification of Atlantic species of <em>Scaphander</em>."

229976	2013	AS	Molecular data reveal cryptic lineages within the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean small mussel drills of the <i>Ocinebrina edwardsii</i> complex (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Muricidae)	"We used a molecular phylogenetic approach to investigate species delimitations and diversification in the mussel drills of the <i>Ocinebrina edwardsii</i> complex by means of a combination of nuclear (internal transcribed spacer 2, ITS2) and mitochondrial [cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S] sequences. Our sample included 243 specimens ascribed to seven currently accepted species from 51 sites. Five of the samples were from either the type locality of a nominal species or a close nearby locality (<i>O. edwardsii</i> from Corsica, <i>O. carmelae</i> and <i>O. piantonii</i> from the Kerkennah Islands, <i>O. hispidula</i> from the Gulf of Gabès and <i>O. leukos</i> from the Canary Islands), one from the inferred original locality (<i>O. ingloria</i> from Venice Lagoon), and specimens assigned in the recent literature to <i>O. nicolai</i>. We used a combination of distance- and tree-based species delimitation methods to identify Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) to compare with the <i>a?priori</i> species identifications. The consensus tree obtained by BEAST on the COI alignment allows the recognition of several distinct clades supported by the three species delimitation methods employed. The eight-MOTUs scenario, shared by the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) methods, comprises the following major clades: clade A contains the south Tunisian species <i>Ocinebrina piantonii</i> Cecalupo, Buzzurro & Mariani from which the sympatric taxon <i>O. carmelae</i> Cecalupo, Buzzurro & Mariani (new synonym) cannot be separated; clades B and C bring together all populations from the Aegean Sea and some from the Ionian Sea, respectively; clade D groups, on the one hand, the south Tunisian samples morphologically assigned to <i>O. hispidula</i> Pallary and, on the other, Atlantic and Alboran Sea samples (including the Canarian taxon <i>O. leukos</i> Houart); clade E includes a sample from the type locality of <i>O. edwardsii</i> and several samples from the Tyrrhenian Sea; clades F and G correspond to a few samples from the Venice Lagoon and the Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively; clade H groups the bulk of samples from the Adriatic Sea, including samples from the Venice Lagoon morphologically identified as <i>Ocinebrina ingloria</i> (Crosse), and some from the Ionian Sea. No final conclusions could be reached to reconcile the currently recognized morphological taxa with the clades suggested by the COI data. The geographical structure proposed by the mitochondrial markers is similar to that found in other marine invertebrates and partially corresponds to the species defined by shell characters. We propose here a framework for the revision of the <i>Ocinebrina edwardsii</i> species complex, suggesting a geographical pattern for the diversification of this group in the studied area."

Assuming that many luminous species acquire their luminous substrate (luciferin) through the food chain, we investigated the feeding habits of a Norwegian population of the lantern shark <i>Etmopterus spinax</i> Linnaeus, 1758 in order to identify potential alimentary sources of luciferin in this species. Among the major groups of preys found in the diet of <i>E. spinax</i>, we identified three potential sources of luciferin: the euphausiid <i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i> Sars, 1857 (tetrapyrrole luciferin), the shrimp <i>Pasiphaea multidentata</i> Esmark, 1866 (coelenterazine) and the teleost <i>Maurolicus muelleri</i> Gmelin, 1789 (coelenterazine). Their luciferins were tested for their presence in the digestive tract and photogenic organs of <i>E. spinax</i> as well as for their cross-reaction with a putative shark catalyst. Although not detected in the diet, the cypridinid luciferin, the third most widespread marine luciferin, was also assayed. As a result, only the coelenterazine was unambiguously detected in the digestive tract of <i>E. spinax</i> and none of the tested luciferins reacted with the shark catalyst extract.

With the increase of artificial hard substrata, it is essential to understand understanding the community composition of these ecosystems. For example, with the increase of wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) accurate sampling of hard substrata fouling communities including rare and non-indigenous species is important. This study focuses on the qualification and quantification of the efficiency and accuracy of hard substrate sampling methods. From previous studies, the airlift suction sampler was found to be the most efficient method to sample hard substrata epifauna as the quadrat techniques underestimate the species density (loss of individuals during sampling). For this study, the efficiency and feasibility of three airlift devices with different tube diameter – 5,80 cm; 4,46 cm and 2,81 cm- was tested at three levels: (1) species and taxon density, (2) diversity, and (3) community structure. Samples were collected from concrete blocks outside the Revellata bay located on the western coast of Corsica. Randomly, five replicates were collected from the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the concrete blocks using different airlift diameters. A total of 2903 ind. m-2 spread over 147 species was identified. Only hard substratum related species were collected with the airlift devices. No matter which airlift device, the mean surface density are considerably higher in samples collected from the horizontal surface (4003 ind. m-2) than the samples collected from the vertical surface (2489 ind. m-2). The latter difference might be related to loss of sampling material on the vertical surface and less on the difference in community structure between both surfaces as no significant difference in algae cover was observed. The impact of the three different airlift diameter devices showed no statistically significant difference in density, diversity and community structure. No significant difference does not necessarily means no difference as significance is also depending on the intrinsic variability and hence degree of replication. This study showed that all three airlift diameters were accurate in sampling hard substrata. From a practical point of view, the medium-sized airlift device is more easily to operate at certain depth as the small-sized airlift device has the risk of clogging depending on the hard substrata coverage while the large-sized airlift device is more difficult to operate.

238311	2013	AS	Selective settlement of deep-sea canyon nematodes after resuspension - an experimental approach	"Dispersal processes are known to influence dynamics of marine benthic communities. It has been argued that as a result of nematodes being small in size and lacking pelagic larvae, it is unlikely that they are able to disperse actively over wide geographical ranges. Nematode dispersal is therefore assumed to be predominantly driven by water currents entraining resuspended sediments containing nematodes. Three different types of substrates combined with sediment (algae, bacteria, and sulphides) and two different controls (empty and azoic sediment) were offered to a nematode community sinking through the water column in three independent, simultaneously running replicated experiments. Selective settlement of nematodes was observed whilst descending in the water column under ex-situ experimental conditions using samples collected in the Whittard canyon at 812 m of water depth. Significant differences in nematode community structure between treatments suggest that different nematodes are attracted by different substrates. They may colonise suitable patches selectively when descending in the water column, but whether they are attracted by food or by other attractants, such as pheromones or other chemical signals, is still unclear. High abundances of the chemosynthetic, mouthless nematode <i>Astomonema</i> found in the canyon study area over medium-scale distances (10-100 m) contribute to the idea that resuspension events enable dispersal of nematodes over larger distances, after which active settlement can occur through chemical attraction."

In this review, we introduce the marine annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>, a member of the lophotrochozoan clade (a key yet most understudied superphylum of bilaterians), as a suitable model system for the simultaneous study, at cellular resolution, of macro-evolutionary processes across phyla and of micro-evolutionary processes across highly polymorphic populations collected worldwide. Recent advances in molecular and experimental techniques, easy maintenance and breeding, and the fast, synchronous and stereotypical development have facilitated the establishment of <i>Platynereis</i> as one of the leading model species in the eco–evo–devo field. Most importantly, <i>Platynereis</i> allows the combination of expression profiling, morphological and physiological characterization at the single cell level. Here, we discuss recent advances in the collection of –omics data for the lab strain and for natural populations collected world-wide that can be integrated with population-specific cellular analyses to result in a cellular atlas integrating genetic, phenotypic and ecological variation. This makes <i>Platynereis</i> a tractable system to begin understanding the interplay between macro- and micro-evolutionary processes and cell type diversity."

Gastropods were sampled from 45 sites distributed within 12 Large Marine Ecosystem regions (LME) following the NaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas) standard protocol (www.nagisa.coml.org). A total of 393 gastropod taxa from 87 families were collected. Eight of these families (9.2%) appeared in four or more different LMEs. Among these, the Littorinidae was the most widely distributed (8 LMEs) followed by the Trochidae and the Columbellidae (6 LMEs). In all regions, assemblages were dominated by few species, the most diverse and abundant of which were herbivores. No latitudinal gradients were evident in relation to species richness or densities among sampling sites. Highest diversity was found in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Alaska, while highest densities were found at different latitudes and represented by few species within one genus (e.g. Afrolittorina in the Agulhas Current, Littorina in the Scotian Shelf, and Lacuna in the Gulf of Alaska). No significant correlation was found between species composition and environmental variables (r <= 0.355, p>0.05). Contributing variables to this low correlation included invasive species, inorganic pollution, SST anomalies, and chlorophyll-a anomalies. Despite data limitations in this study which restrict conclusions in a global context, this work represents the first effort to sample gastropod biodiversity on rocky shores using a standardized protocol across a wide scale.

It was also associated with a dramatic, long-lasting change in sedimentation style along the margins of the Tethys Ocean, from generally organic-matter-poor sediments during the Triassic to generally organic-matter-rich black shales during the Jurassic. New core material from Germany provides biomarker evidence of persistent photic-zone euxinia during the Hettangian, the onset of which is associated with a series of both negative and positive carbon isotope excursions. Combined inorganic and organic geochemical and micropalaeontological analyses reveal strong similarities between the Hettangian and the better-known Toarcian anoxic event. These events appear to be the most clearly expressed events within a series of anoxic episodes that also include poorly studied black shale intervals during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian. Both the Hettangian and Toarcian events are marked by important changes in phytoplankton assemblages from chromophyte- to chlorophyte-dominated assemblages within the European Epicontinental Seaway. Phytoplankton changes occurred in association with the establishment of photic-zone euxinia, driven by a general increase in salinity stratification and warming of surface waters. For both events, the causes of large negative carbon isotope excursions remain incompletely understood; evidence exists for both variation in the d<sup>13</sup>C of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and variation in the sources of organic carbon. Regardless of the causes of d<sup>13</sup>C variability, long-term ocean anoxia during the Early Jurassic can be attributed to greenhouse warming and increased nutrient delivery to the oceans triggered by flood basalt volcanism."

253017	2013	AS	Pelagic propagule duration and developmental mode: reassessment of a fading link	"Aim As the main or sole motile stage of many aquatic taxa, propagules play a central role in their population dynamics, macroevolution and biogeography. The premises of studies concerned with dispersal, on issues as diverse as marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries and invasive species, commonly make simplified assumptions linking larval development mode (planktotrophic, lecithotrophic) and pelagic propagule duration (PPD) or pelagic larval duration. Because general empirical tests of these connections have yielded equivocal results, we critically examined the relationship between larval mode and PPD in light of regional and taxon-specific criteria. Location Oceans world-wide. Methods We collated data from 190 species from the phylum Echinodermata and used two-way and one-way ANOVA to compare PPD among larval modes, taxonomic classes, geographic regions and climate zones. We also assessed the contribution of egg size, temperature and other continuous predictors using multiple regressions and ANCOVA, and examined whether geographic range size differed among larval modes. Results Our results depart from the common assumption that planktotrophs have longer PPDs than lecithotrophs. Instead, we detected a synergistic influence of phylogeny and climate. No significant difference in PPD between planktotrophs and lecithotrophs occurred in two of the four classes and only four out of nine major ocean basins contained species with significantly different PPDs on the basis of larval mode. Species from colder climates displayed relatively constant PPDs regardless of larval mode, whereas temperate and warm-water species displayed a clearer dichotomy. PPD did not correlate with geographic range size nor did planktotrophs and lecithotrophs exhibit significantly different range sizes. Main conclusions Our findings indicate that larval mode is not a reliable predictor of PPD across broad geographic and taxonomic scales. Instead developmental strategies may instigate shorter or longer PPDs in schemes that are influenced by evolutionary and environmental pressures."	"Mercier, A.; Sewell, M.A.; Hamel, J.-F."

It has several important practical and academic applications. For this reason, having computational tools capable of analyzing bathymetric charts would be useful for domain experts studying the various problems related to water depth. Data mining is a well known technique for extracting information from large datasets, but cannot be directly applied to images. The contribution of this work is an approach for using data mining in bathymetry images. We propose a method for processing input images, in order to extract records and their features, which can be processed by classic data mining algorithms. Additionally, we also propose techniques to visualize both data mining results and map characteristics.

254656	2013	AS	Applying distribution model projections for an uncertain future: the case of the Pacific oyster in UK waters	"    The inherent complexity of the environment is such that attempts to model it must operate under simplifications and assumptions. Considering predictions from alternative models, with a range of assumptions and data requirements, therefore provides a more robust approach.    The intractability and uncertainty resulting from a suite of predictions may hinder the application of science in policy, where a single prediction with little ambiguity or uncertainty would be most desirable. Few studies modelling species' distributions attempt to present multi-model outputs in a format most useful to the non-modelling community, and none of these have done so for the marine environment.    The problem of uncertainty is particularly prevalent in predicting the distribution of invasive alien species under climate change. As invasive alien species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and may incur significant economic costs, the benefit of applying predictions to highlight areas of possible establishment and inform policy and management may be large.    An ensemble prediction is used to assess the distribution of suitable habitat for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, in UK waters both currently and in the future. The ensemble incorporates predictions from three species distribution models, using data from two global climate models. A method is developed highlighting the agreement of the ensemble, further applying threshold values to retain information from constituent predictions in the final map of agreement.    Ensemble predictions made here suggest that Pacific oyster will experience an opening of suitable habitat in northern UK waters, reaching the Faroe Islands and the eastern Norwegian Sea by 2050. Habitat suitability will increase with warming temperatures in the English Channel and Central North Sea for this species. The approaches applied here can be incorporated into risk assessment frameworks for invasive species, as stipulated in the Convention on Biological Diversity."

253009	2013	AS	Plumbing the depths: extending ecological niche modelling and species distribution modelling in three dimensions	"Aim Ecological niche modelling (ENM) and species distribution modelling (SDM) have been used extensively to study biogeographic and macroecological patterns of terrestrial fauna and flora. Few studies to date have applied ENM and SDM to marine ecosystems, and those that have treated the marine environment as a two-dimensional space owing to limitations of the implementations of current ENM/SDM tools. For many marine organisms, ENM/SDM should be performed in three-dimensional space, taking into account latitude, longitude and depth. We present a case study demonstrating a strategy for three-dimensional ENM/SDM. Location Open ocean; global. Methods We decompose the three-dimensional structure of marine environmental and species occurrence data into a series of two-dimensional spaces using an easy-to-implement transformation, after which existing ENM/SDM tools can be used to analyse the data. We demonstrate our approach by modelling the potential distribution of a deep-sea-dwelling jellyfish with two commonly used algorithms. Potential effects of missing data and spatial sampling biases were assessed using resampling approaches. Results We demonstrate that it is feasible to derive predictive models of three-dimensional distributions of marine species using existing software tools developed with two-dimensional terrestrial situations in mind. The strategy presented here allowed us to model the distribution of a jellyfish species that inhabits the deep sea. We assessed the effects of missing occurrence data and spatial bias of occurrence data, and found that interpolation among occurrence data-points and extrapolation into unsampled conditions present distinct challenges that may require different modelling algorithms and interpretations. Main conclusions Our modified ENM/SDM approach is straightforward, and can be used to model situations that have heretofore been beyond the reach of ENM/SDM applications. In particular, geographic distributions and ecological niches of organisms inhabiting three-dimensional habitats such as water columns in marine and freshwater environments can be modelled using the framework presented here."

However, such worries result from overestimates of how many species may exist, beliefs that the expertise to describe species is decreasing, and alarmist estimates of extinction rates. We argue that the number of species on Earth today is 5 +/- 3 million, of which 1.5 million are named. New databases show that there are more taxonomists describing species than ever before, and their number is increasing faster than the rate of species description. Conservation efforts and species survival in secondary habitats are at least delaying extinctions. Extinction rates are, however, poorly quantified, ranging from 0.01 to 1% (at most 5%) per decade.

254213	2013	AS	Latitudinal diversity of sea anemones (Cnidaria: Actiniaria)	"We sought to determine if the global distribution of sea anemones (cnidarian order Actiniaria) conforms to the classic pattern of biogeography-taxon richness at the equator with attenuation toward the poles-a pattern that is derived almost entirely from data on terrestrial plants and animals. We plotted the empirical distribution of species occurrences in 10 degrees bands of latitude based on published information, then, using the Chao2 statistic, inferred the completeness of that inventory. We found the greatest species richness of sea anemones at 30-40 ° N and S, with lower numbers at tropical latitudes and the fewest species in polar areas. The Chao2 statistic allowed us to infer that the richness pattern we found is not due to particularly poor knowledge of tropical sea anemones. No 10 degrees band of latitude has less than 60% of the theoretical number of species known, but for only about half of them could we reject the null hypothesis (P = 0.05) that information is complete; anemone diversity is best documented at high latitudes. We infer that the 1089 valid species currently known constitute about 70% of the theoretical total of about 1500 species of Actiniaria. The distribution pattern of sea anemone species resembles that of planktonic foraminiferans and benthic marine algae, although planktonic bacteria, marine bivalves, and shallow and deep scleractinian corals show the terrestrial pattern of equatorial richness attenuating with latitude. Sea anemone species richness is complementary to that of scleractinian corals at many scales; our findings affirm it at the global scale."	"Fautin, D.G.; Malarky, L.; Soberón, J."

However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems must be based on total removals, so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. Total removals by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929-2010 were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million tonnes (t) publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. The reconstructed total removals on the BNS were estimated to be 55% higher than the 0.8million t publicly reported over this period. In terms of percentages, discards on the BNS represent an average annual of 34% over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000s, approximately 50% of all Belgian removals from the BNS are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (<12m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical total removals for Belgium’s sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives.

Using data for threatened marine vertebrate species, we show how areas prioritized for conservation shift spatially when economic factors are used as a surrogate to favor areas where collaborative potential in conservation is more likely.

240521	2013	AS	From microbes to macrofauna: an integrated study of deep benthic communities and their response to environmental variables along the Malta Escarpment (Ionian Sea)	"A comparative study for abundance, biomass and diversity was carried out for the prokaryote, meiofauna and macrofauna communities at three depth stations (1200, 1800 and 2100 m) along the Malta Escarpment (Mediterranean Sea). Our investigation showed a two-fold increase with depth in prokaryote abundance; the contribution of prokaryote biomass to the total benthic biomass was predominant at all depths. Bacteria were the dominant prokaryote component and Archaea formed a considerable fraction (20%-30%) of the prokaryote assemblages. The meio- and macrofauna abundances and meiofauna biomass did not decrease significantly with depth but macrofauna biomass did. The a diversity did not follow a clear bathymetric trend for both nematode and macrofauna species. Probably because of the large number of eurybathic nematode genera, nor did the turnover diversity in nematode composition change down the depth gradient. Conversely, for the macrofauna there was a perceptible change in community composition between the shallowest station and the two deeper stations. Food availability affected only the macrobenthic component. The increase in the prokaryote organisms with depth and the dominance of nematodes and macrofauna deposit feeders suggest active grazing by the two benthic components on microbes. This would transfer energy to the higher trophic levels through the microbial compartment."	"Baldrighi, E.; Aliani, S.; Conversi, A.; Lavaleye, M.; Borghini, M.; Manini, E."	WOS:000328274900010

First, we construct a global database of primary valuation studies that focus on recreational benefits of coastal ecosystems. Second, the profile of each of the 253 individual observations is enriched with characteristics of the built coastal environment (accessibility, anthropogenic pressure, human development level), natural coastal environment (presence of protected area, ecosystem type, marine biodiversity), geo-climatic factors (temperature, precipitation), and sociopolitical context. We then propose a meta-analytical framework that is built upon a Geographic Information System (GIS) and allow for the exploration of the spatial dimension of the valued ecosystems, including the role of spatial heterogeneity of the selected meta-regression variables as well as the spatial profile of the transferred values. The empirical outcome results in the first global map of the values of coastal recreation, which may play a crucial role in identifying and ranking coastal area conservation priorities from a socio-economic perspective."

Here growth rates were estimated in the single axis, non-branching Antarctic octocoral <i>Primnoella scotiae</i> using repeated <i>in situ</i> length measures covering both summer and winter periods, for tagged colonies from three sites at Signy Island over a two year period. Mean rates of length increase at the different sites ranged from 0.96 mm yr<sup>?1</sup> to 55.3 mm yr<sup>?1</sup>. The fastest individual colony growth rate at any site ranged from 2.55 mm yr<sup>?1</sup> to 175.6 mm yr<sup>?1</sup>.

Several of the 15 species that were sampled between June and September 2009 were found to be contaminated with OVTX-a as the major toxin (90% of the toxin profile) and PlTX; this included fish, echinoderms, gastropods, crustaceans and cephalopods. The contamination levels varied geographically and between species, with the herbivorous species generally having higher toxin levels than carnivorous ones.
The determination of the toxin distribution between the digestive tube (DT) and the remaining tissue (RT) or roe in the case of the sea urchin <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i> showed that the toxins were sequestered in the DT. The highest toxin level ever recorded over the course of the study was of 392.2 ?g for the sum of OVTX-a and PlTX per kg of DT of the flathead mullet <i>Mugil cephalus</i>. No quantifiable levels of toxins were found in the roe of the sea urchins or in the RT of the other marine products. However, in several cases, the toxin level in the whole flesh of the analysed organisms was above 30 ?g OVTX-a + PlTX/kg, when knowing that the European food safety authority's opinion is that an adult should not ingest more than 30 ?g PlTX + OST-D per kg of shellfish meat to avoid putting the consumer's health at risk. This was observed for the following four species: the sea urchin <i>P. lividus</i>, the red-mouthed rock shell <i>Stramonita haemastoma</i>, the warty crab <i>Eriphia verrucosa</i> and the flathead mullet <i>M. cephalus</i>.
The collection of such data is of great importance to refine and complete the risk assessment of PlTX and its analogues and has to be encouraged in order to provide reliable information for setting up a regulatory level that would protect the consumers of edible marine organisms."

Species and traits’ biomass levels seemed to be first determined by habitat filtering, selecting those traits better adapted to the biologically challenging estuarine environment. Within that subset of traits and within each habitat, biotic interactions were probably high, as evidenced by high ?-diversity and community weighted mean differences. The former patterns hold for the disturbance/recovery scenario considered. However, as the estuary recovered, biomass became more distributed among different trait categories, consistent with increases in FD when the seagrass started to increase. Policy towards the restoration of seagrass bed and other biogenic structures, and improving the connectivity within adjacent systems were confirmed and suggested, as this would imply higher FD and potentially higher resilience to disturbance within the estuarine intertidal system."

Toxicity information is available for at least 41 crude oils and 56 dispersants.

Effect concentrations have varied by as much as six orders of magnitude due to experimental diversity. This diversity restricts phytotoxicity predictions and identification of sensitive species, life stages and response parameters. As a result, evidence-based risk assessments for most aquatic plants and petrochemicals and dispersants are not supported by the current toxicity database.

In the western Mediterranean lower slope an accumulation of biomass, but not diversity, at depths of 1200–1350 m has been observed. However, the precise causes of this biomass peak are unknown. We examined the patterns of megafauna benthic biomass in the Catalan sea open slope, from 900 to 1750 m depth, expanding the results in the context of the whole continental margin. Sampling was carried out by combining an Otter-Trawl Maireta System (OTMS) and an Agassiz trawl, during four different seasons in 2008/2009. At the same time, current speed, temperature and salinity were obtained year-round by means of near-bottom deployed sensors (current meters and temperature-conductivity sensors). Total biomass followed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at depths of 1050–1350 m. Range-related ecological forcings between shallower and deeper species may have caused this biomass accumulation at intermediate slope depths. We also report on the seasonal variations of biomass in the studied depth range, identifying a dynamic zone above 1000 m depth where populations of highly mobile species perform year-round migrations throughout the slope, and a more static region below 1000 m (i.e. the twilight zone end) with substantially less inter-annual variations. The arrival of new Western Mediterranean Deep Water from the deep basin to the lower slope in March–May may have driven the accumulation of biomass at 900 and 1050 m depth over the same period. In addition, an adjacent submarine canyon was sampled with the same procedures to characterize its benthic megafauna community. Analyses revealed higher diversity, but not biomass, inside the canyon than in the adjacent open slope, and a significantly different assemblage composition between the two habitats. These results strengthen the concept of submarine canyons as hotspots of biodiversity and underline the importance of their conservation as diversity repositories."

It remains to be rigorously evaluated, however, how to distinguish between sources of LD disagreement. In addition, death assemblages (DAs) also preserve important information on regional diversity which is not available from single censuses of the life assemblages (LAs). The northern Adriatic Sea is an ecosystem under anthropogenic pressure, and we studied the distribution and abundance of living and dead bivalve and gastropod species in the physically stressful environments (tidal flat and shallow sublittoral soft bottoms) associated with the delta of the Isonzo River (Gulf of Trieste). Specifically we evaluated the fidelity of richness, evenness, abundance, habitat discrimination and beta diversity. A total of 10,740 molluscs from fifteen tidal flat and fourteen sublittoral sites were analyzed for species composition and distribution of living and dead molluscs. Of 78 recorded species, only eleven were numerically abundant. There were many more dead than living individuals and rarefied species richness in the DA was higher at all spatial scales, but the differences are lower in habitats and in the region than at individual stations. Evenness was always higher in death assemblages, and probably due to temporally more variable LAs the differences are stronger in the sublittoral habitats. Distinct assemblages characterized intertidal and sublittoral habitats, and the distribution and abundance of empty shells generally corresponded to that of the living species. Death assemblages have lower beta diversity than life assemblages, but empty shells capture compositional differences between habitats to a higher degree than living shells. More samples would be necessary to account for the diversity of living molluscs in the study area, which is, however, well recorded in the death assemblages. There is no indication of a major environmental change over the last decades in this area, but due to the long history of anthropogenic pressure here, such a potential impact might be preserved in historical layers of the deeper sedimentary record."

There is a decreasing west–east species-richness gradient, especially for the total species richness and the amphipods. In addition, quantitative sampling in Bou Ismail Bay in summer 1988 (98 sampling sites for a total of 841 species) shows that diversity indices (i.e. species richness, >100 species for 0.2 m?2; Shannon diversity, >6.0; and ES50, >34) are among the highest for similar sand and muddy-fine sand communities in the Mediterranean Sea and the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Bou Ismail Bay appears to have the highest species richness among Algerian bays, probably because of its variety of benthic habitats and the absence of significant pollution in this area.

Within the framework of the REBENT network, sediment characteristics, depth, and macrofaunal abundance were determined for 95 stations spread over five subtidal sectors, using a combination of seabed acoustic remote sensing systems and grab sampling. The physico-chemical properties of the water column and the hydrodynamic conditions were generated by validated three-dimensional environmental models which take into account variations over shorter temporal scales. Multivariate analyses ranked 16 natural abiotic variables according to the significance of their influence on the macrofauna. Together these variables explained 51% of spatial variation in the macrofauna, with morpho-sedimentological and hydrological factors contributing 22% and 26%, respectively. The outputs from validated three-dimensional environmental models appear to be useful interpretational tools for benthic ecology studies, especially in estuarine and coastal ecosystems with high environmental variability due to regular freshwater inputs.

Mixotrophic dinoflagellates follow photoautotrophic diatoms but precede their obligate heterotrophic counterparts in the succession because of the relative advantages afforded by photosynthesizing when light and nutrients are available in spring. The mean cell size of the sampled diatoms is smallest in the summer, likely because of the higher specific nutrient affinity of smaller relative to larger cells. Contrastingly, we hypothesize that mixotrophy diminishes the size selection based on nutrient limitation and accounts for the lack of a seasonal size shift among surveyed dinoflagellates. Relatively small, heterotrophic dinoflagellates (µg C cell<sup>?1</sup> < 10<sup>?3</sup>) peak after other, larger dinoflagellates, in part because of the increased abundance of their small prey during nutrient-deplete summer months. The largest surveyed diatoms (µg C cell<sup>?1</sup> > 10<sup>?2</sup>) bloom later than others, and we hypothesize that this may be because of their relatively slow maximum potential growth rates and high internal nutrient storage, as well as to the slower predation of these larger cells. The new trait database and analysis presented here helps translate the taxonomic information of the CPR survey into metrics that can be directly compared with trait-based models."

A large number of national, regional, and global online databases provide information on the distribution, pathways of introduction, and impacts of alien species. The sufficiency and efficiency of the current online information systems to assist the European policy on alien species was investigated by a comparative analysis of occurrence data across 43 online databases. Large differences among databases were found which are partially explained by variations in their taxonomical, environmental, and geographical scopes but also by the variable efforts for continuous updates and by inconsistencies on the definition of “alien” or “invasive” species. No single database covered all European environments, countries, and taxonomic groups. In many European countries national databases do not exist, which greatly affects the quality of reported information. To be operational and useful to scientists, managers, and policy makers, online information systems need to be regularly updated through continuous monitoring on a country or regional level. We propose the creation of a network of online interoperable web services through which information in distributed resources can be accessed, aggregated and then used for reporting and further analysis at different geographical and political scales, as an efficient approach to increase the accessibility of information.

We analyzed the stomach contents of 35 fishes representing ten families (Xiphiidae, Istiophoridae, Scombridae, Carangidae, Coryphaenidae, Alepisauridae, Dasyatidae, Carcharhinidae, Alopiidae and Sphyrnidae) and of the sooty tern <i>Onychoprion fuscata</i>of the Mozambique Channel from 2000 to 2010. Both fresh and accumulated beaks were used for identifying cephalopod prey. Cephalopods were important prey for twelve predators; swordfish <i>Xiphias gladius</i> had the highest cephalopod proportion; sooty tern (<i>O. fuscata</i>) and bigeye tuna (<i>Thunnus obesus</i>) had high proportions too. We recovered 23 cephalopod families and identified 38 species. Ten species from four Teuthida families (Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae) and two Octopoda families (Argonautidae and Bolitaenidae) occurred very frequently in the stomach contents, while Sepiida were rare. Ommastrephidae were the most cephalopod food sources: the purpleback flying squid <i>Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis</i> was the most prevalent prey by far, <i>Ornithoteuthis volatilis</i> was important for eleven predators and few but large specimens of the neon flying squid <i>Ommastrephes bartramii</i> were recovered in the stomachs of swordfish in the Indian South Subtropical Gyre province only. Predators' groups were identified based on cephalopod prey composition, on depth in which they forage, and on prey size. Surface predators' diets were characterized by lower cephalopod diversity but greater average numbers of cephalopod prey, whereas the deep-dwelling predators (swordfish and bigeye tuna) preyed on larger specimens than surface predators (<i>O. fuscata </i>or yellowfin tunas <i>Thunnus albacores</i>). Our findings emphasized the usefulness of a community of marine predators to gain valuable information on the biology and the distribution of the cephalopod forage fauna that are discussed with regard to biogeographic province, marine predator, fishing gear to catch the large pelagic fishes, and size of the beaks recovered in the stomachs."

The highest abundance and diversity was found below the thermocline during the day, and above it at night. A second peak in abundance, around 400 m depth, associated with a decrease in diversity, could be linked to the increase in abundance of a single species—<i>Dimophyes arctica</i> (Chun 1897). The siphonophore communities could be related to the different water masses in the Bay, with an important influence of lateral transport of both tropical and subarctic species into the Bay by the different water masses."

287733	2013	AS	Predicting what Helminth parasites a fish species should have using Parasite Co-occurrence modeler (PaCo)	"Fish pathologists are often interested in which parasites would likely be present in a particular host. Parasite Co-occurrence Modeler (PaCo) is a tool for identifying a list of parasites known from fish species that are similar ecologically, phylogenetically, and geographically to the host of interest. PaCo uses data from FishBase (maximum length, growth rate, life span, age at maturity, trophic level, phylogeny, and biogeography) to estimate compatibility between a target host and parasite species–genera from the major helminth groups (Acanthocephala, Cestoda, Monogenea, Nematoda, and Trematoda). Users can include any combination of host attributes in a model. These unique features make PaCo an innovative tool for addressing both theoretical and applied questions in parasitology. In addition to predicting the occurrence of parasites, PaCo can be used to investigate how host characteristics shape parasite communities. To test the performance of the PaCo algorithm, we created 12,400 parasite lists by applying any possible combination of model parameters (248) to 50 fish hosts. We then measured the relative importance of each parameter by assessing their frequency in the best models for each host. Host phylogeny and host geography were identified as the most important factors, with both present in 88% of the best models. Habitat (64%) was identified in more than half of the best models. Among ecological parameters, trophic level (41%) was the most relevant while life span (34%), growth rate (32%), maximum length (28%), and age at maturity (20%) were less commonly linked to best models.

In this study, the species identification of an “adulterant” oyster with small body size, which is often misidentified as a “young individual” of other sympatric species, including <i>C. sikamea</i> and <i>C. hongkongensis</i>, was determined for the first time, based on molecular markers (partial mitochondrial <i>cox1</i> and <i>rrnL</i> genes), phylogenetic analysis, and morphometric approaches. This novel species, <i>C. zhanjiangensis</i>, commonly known as the “cat ear oyster” in Guandu (a famous estuarine oyster farming region of Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China), appears to potentially influence the efficiency of <i>C. hongkongensis</i> spat collection due to niche competition on spat collection devices. Phylogenetic analyses confirm its status as the most basal taxon of the Indo-Pacific <i>Crassostrea</i>. A comparative study of the shell characteristics of <i>C. zhanjiangensis</i>, and other <i>Crassostrea</i> species revealed several distinctive morphological traits, including a generally smaller body size, a deeply cupped left valve, and a right valve that is convex in adults but flat in young individuals. Other distinctive features of the new species include life cycle traits that are unique compared with the sympatric <i>C. hongkongensis</i> and <i>C. sikamea</i> species, such as a higher growth rate in the fast growth phase after settlement, followed by a significantly slower growth rate and mass mortality during subsequent life stages.

At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs’ shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions."

Because of difficulties in species identification, little is known about species-dependent sediment reworking and solute transport. The closely related species are apparently similar in feeding and sediment-dwelling behavior, but size and burrowing depth indicate differences in bioturbation and the biogeochemical consequences thereof. To investigate these potential differences, a tracer experiment with artificial particles (luminophores) and solute tracer (bromide) was conducted. Polychaetes were identified to species level using a molecular genetic key. Modeled results show that all three species display markedly low particle reworking rates with biodiffusion coefficients (<i>Db</i>) of 1.76 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>?1</sup> (<i>M. viridis</i>) and 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>?1</sup> (<i>M. neglecta</i>) at an abundance of 1273 individuals m<sup>?2</sup> and 0.44 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>?1</sup> (<i>M. arctia</i>) at twice that abundance. Nonlocal transport coefficients are negligible in all cases. Solute transport by <i>M. neglecta</i> and <i>M. viridis</i> are more similar to one another than to <i>M. arctia</i>, whose solute transport mode is much more diffusive in character (10.9-fold enhanced diffusivity with nonlocal irrigation coefficients [<i>?</i>] of 55.3 yr<sup>?1</sup>) than that of the two other species, which affect tracer distributions in the sediment predominantly through a nonlocal, advective transport mode (<i>?</i> of 108.9 yr<sup>?1</sup> <i>M. viridis</i> and 130.9 yr<sup>?1</sup> <i>M. neglecta</i>).

This has now been attempted for the Knysna estuarine bay in the Garden Route National Park, South Africa, an important site for one vulnerable and declining seagrass, Cape dwarf-eelgrass (<i>Nanozostera capensis</i>), and for several associated animals. Although spanning a salinity range of <5–35, the seagrass beds of this estuary contained a unitary fauna with local variation in frequency and abundance of the various species. Faunal biodiversity was highest along the main estuarine channel in the marine-influenced region and declined both upstream and into the sheltered peripheral zones, overall faunal abundance being inversely correlated with species diversity (though not with species richness). This pattern results in the beds around the 4 km shoreline of a single island near the mouth supporting 91 % of the total macrobenthic invertebrate species present in the system. This situation is discussed in relation to such data as are available from other comparable systems and to the conservation of estuarine seagrass faunal biodiversity. It is concluded that in general and with caveats for some individual species of concern where conservation resources are limited attention would most profitably be focused on the seagrass meadows of downstream estuarine areas."

Our multigene analysis of standard nuclear and mitochondrial markers demonstrates that the topology of the order Chitonida is divided into four clades, which have also been recovered in previous studies: Mopalioidea is sister to Cryptoplacoidea, forming a clade Acanthochitonina. The family Callochitonidae is sister to Acanthochitonina. Chitonoidea is resolved as the earliest diverging group within Chitonida. Consideration of this unexpected result for <i>Choriplax</i> and our well-supported phylogeny has revealed differing patterns of shell reduction separating the two superfamilies within Acanthochitonina.

Extensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments suggest that mangroves will be impacted by climate change, but few studies have tested these predictions over large scales using statistical models. We provide the first example of applying species and community distribution models (SDMs and CDMs, respectively) to coastal mangroves worldwide. Species distributions were modeled as ensemble forecasts using BIOMOD. Distributions of mangrove communities with high species richness were modeled in three ways: as the sum of the separate SDM outputs, as binary hotspots (with >3 species) using a generalized linear model, and continuously using a general boosted model. Individual SDMs were projected for 12 species with sufficient data and CDMs were projected for 30 species into 2080 using global climate model outputs and a range of sea-level rise projections. Species projected to shift their ranges polewards by at least 2 degrees of latitude consistently experience a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them. Central America and the Caribbean are forecast to lose more mangrove species than other parts of the world. We found that the extent and grain size, at which continuous CDM outputs are examined, independent of the grain size at which the models operate, can dramatically influence the number of pseudo-absences needed for optimal parameterization. The SDMs and CDMs presented here provide a first approximation of how mangroves will respond to climate change given simple correlative relationships between occurrence records and environmental data. Additional, precise georeferenced data on mangrove localities and concerted efforts to collect data on ecological processes across large-scale climatic gradients will enable future research to improve upon these correlative models."

The present paper extends this work into the deeper waters of the region, describing two new species and one new genus. The new species of the genus <i>Paradoxapseudes</i> has a combination of three maxillule palp setae, no plumose setae on the basis of pereopod 1 nor proximal serration on the antennal peduncle. The second species represents a new genus of the family Anarthruridae, having six marginal setae on the third maxilliped palp article and spines on the merus and carpus of the anterior pereopods. The high diversity of Tanaidacea in Australian waters is discussed. In particular, we conclude that Australian coasts suffer a diversity of immigration routes, have sufficient marine longevity, and afford such a diversity of available niches to have allowed multiple colonization and subsequent allopatric speciation of Tanaidacea."

These partially processed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) collections now vastly outweigh the expertise available to make them better “known” via complete taxonomy, yet for many bioregions they represent the most significant body of currently available knowledge. Increasing numbers of cryptic species, previously undetected morphologically, are now being discovered by molecular and chemical analyses. The uncoordinated and fragmented nature of many previous collections, however, means that knowledge and expertise gained from a particular project are often lost to future projects without a biodiversity informatics legacy. Integrating these diverse data (GIS; OTUs; images; molecular, chemical, and other datasets) required a two-way iterative process so far unavailable for sponges with existing biodiversity informatics tools. SpongeMaps arose from the initial need for online collaboration to integrate morphometric data with molecular barcodes, including the Porifera Tree of Life (PorTol) project. It provides interrogation of existing data to better process new collections; capacity to create new OTUs; publication of online pages for individual species, so as to interpret GIS and other data for online biodiversity databases and services; and automatic links to external datasets for taxonomic hierarchy, specimen GIS and mapping, DNA sequence data, chemical structures, and images."

A survey of 360 boats was undertaken of both mooring types at six sites near Auckland, New Zealand by visual observation from the waterline and underwater video. Both methods showed that the boats on swing moorings had more biofouling than those in berths (p < 0.001), and the video found more biofouling than visual observation (p < 0.001). A survey of boat owners found that boats on swing moorings moved at lower speeds (a function of different vessel types), making their speed insufficient to dislodge biofouling and potentially increasing their biosecurity risk. Five invasive marine species were known in the study area and the video images suggested that some of these and other invasive marine species were growing on boat hulls. About 8,700 recreational boats may be moored in the region, indicating that they have the potential to disperse invasive marine species beyond their present range.

Two different domains (eastern and western) can be recognized on the platform during the late Cenomanian, before the onset of the OAE2. The western domain corresponds to a low-energy environment developed on a mid and/or outer ramp with hypoxic waters, low detrital influx and low paleoproductivity. The paleoecological assemblages show limited specific diversity but variable density. The ostracods are opportunistic and unspecialized (<i>r</i> strategists), being associated with Buliminidae, surface and intermediate-water planktonic foraminifera, and fishes. The eastern domain corresponds to an inner ramp and/or peritidal environment with oxic waters, low detrital influx and low paleoproductivity, developed in a higher energy environment with paleoecological assemblages showing high diversity but variable density. The ostracods are more specialized (<i>K</i> strategists), being represented by diverse and constant assemblages associated with diversified benthic foraminifera, calcareous sponges and echinoderms, as well as intermediate- and deep-water planktonic foraminifera. The onset of the OAE2 has no influence on the western ostracod assemblages, but leads to the decline of the ostracod fauna and the disappearance of the deep-water planktonic foraminifera in the eastern domain. During the early Turonian, after the OAE2, the platform becomes an outer ramp with increased paleoproductivity, but is associated with a decrease of taxonomic diversity in hypoxic waters. The ostracods are very sparse and unspecialized, associated with siliceous sponges, Buliminidae, surface-living planktonic foraminifera, fishes and pelagic crinoids. Marine paleobiogeographic communication is relatively easy across the carbonate platforms between the Preafrican Trough and other Moroccan regions, as well as between Morocco and different parts of the South Tethyan and East Atlantic margins belonging to the Cenomanian–Turonian South Tethyan Ostracod Province (STOP).

282430	2013	AS	Collaboration among countries in marine conservation can achieve substantial efficiencies	"Aim

Multinational collaboration is important for successfully protecting marine environments. However, few studies have assessed the costs and benefits incurred by taking collaborative action. One of the most complex marine regions in the world is the Mediterranean Sea biodiversity hotspot. The sea is shared by over 20 countries across three continents with a vast array of socio-economic and political backgrounds. We aimed to examine how collaboration between countries of the Mediterranean Sea affects conservation plans when costs and threats are considered.
Location

The Mediterranean Sea.
Methods

We compared three collaboration scenarios to test the efficiencies of coordinated marine conservation efforts: full coordination between Mediterranean countries, partial coordination within continents and no coordination where countries act in isolation. To do so, we developed four basin-wide surrogates for commercial and recreational fishing effort in the Mediterranean Sea. Using a systematic decision support tool (Marxan), we minimized the opportunity costs while meeting a suite of biodiversity targets.
Results

We discovered that to reach the same conservation targets, a plan where all the countries of the Mediterranean Sea collaborate can save over two-thirds of the cost of a plan where each country acts independently. The benefits of multinational collaboration are surprisingly unequal between countries.
Main conclusions

This approach, which incorporates biodiversity, costs and collaboration into a systematic conservation plan, can help deliver efficient conservation outcomes when planning spatially explicit actions within marine environments shared by many countries."

282432	2013	AS	Predicting extinction from fossil trajectories of geographical ranges in benthic marine molluscs	"AimThe geographical ranges of marine taxa wax and wane in a nearly symmetrical fashion over their durations. We use this pattern as well as the age distribution of genera to predict the time of extinction of extant genera of benthic marine molluscs.LocationA global occurrence database (Paleobiology Database) of fossil marine molluscs from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras was used for this study.MethodsFor the geographical range method, we determined the average trajectories of geographical range size for extinct genera of bivalves and gastropods. The maxima of these trajectories were used as landmarks for predicting the time of extinction for extant genera. Prediction was done by cross-multiplication, using the time elapsed until the maximum was reached and the position of the landmark. For the duration–frequency method, we calculated the time of extinction based on probabilities derived from the frequency distribution of stratigraphic ranges (durations) of all extinct genera. The accuracy and precision of predictions were tested with extinct genera and then applied to extant genera.ResultsOn average, bivalve and gastropod extinct genera reached their maximum geographical range size at 62% and 50% of their total duration. The accuracy of predictions ranged from ?3.1 to 11.0 million years (Myr) for both groups, and the precision ranged from 13.6 to 19.5 Myr. Only a small subset of extant genera was suitable for prediction with the geographical range method, mainly because the geographical ranges of most extant genera are still rising on geological time-scales. The second method provided a similar prediction quality, but showed a substantial decrease in quality when predicting long-duration (> 100 Myr) genera.Main conclusionsThe mean probability for an accurate prediction using the geographical range approach is 57% with a precision of ± 15 Myr. Prediction is possible only for genera whose peak geographical range has already elapsed (17% of extant bivalves, 16% of extant gastropods). The duration–frequency approach does not have this prerequisite and is therefore applicable to many more genera, but prediction quality declines with duration. The two methods therefore complement each other and can supplement the various efforts used to estimate extinction risk."	"Tietje, M.; Kiessling, W."	WOS:000316325500015

MALDI-TOF MS has been shown to be an efficient dereplication tool as it can be used to discriminate between bacterial isolates at the species level. A bacterial culture collection of more than 10,000 heterotrophic marine bacterial isolates from sea-water surface layers of the Norwegian Trondheimsfjord and neighbouring coastal areas has been established. A sub-collection of pigmented isolates was earlier screened for novel carotenoids with UVA-Blue light absorbing properties. This was a comprehensive analytical task and it was observed that a significant number of extracts with identical pigment profile were recovered. Hence, this study was undertaken to explore the use of MALDI-TOF MS as a dereplication tool to quickly characterize the bacterial collection. Furthermore, LC-DAD-MS analysis of pigment profiles was performed to check if pigment profile diversity was maintained among isolates kept after the potential MALDI-TOF MS selection step. Four hundred isolates comprising both pigmented and non-pigmented isolates were used for this study. The resulting MALDI-TOF MS dendrogram clearly identified a diversity of different taxa and these were supported by the pigment profile clustering, thus linking the pigment production as species-specific properties. Although one exception was found, it can be concluded that MALDI-TOF MS dereplication is a promising pre-screening tool for more efficient screening of microbial culture collection containing pigments with potential novel properties."

They represent a diverse group of highly derived taxa in two superfamilies and 10 families. Little work has been done on the phylogeny of these parasites because of the difficulty in defining homologous characters for adults above the genus level. The females exhibit morphological reduction of characters and the males have few distinguishing characters. Moreover, epicarideans have only rarely been included in past studies of isopod phylogeny. Our objective was to derive a phylogeny of epicaridean taxa based on 18S rDNA, then use that phylogeny to examine the relationships of the bopyrid subfamilies, bopyroid families and epicarideans to cymothoid isopods. We tested the monophyly of the Epicaridea, evaluated hypotheses on relationships among epicaridean families and subfamilies, examined the evolution of the abdominal mode of infestation on caridean, gebiidean, axiidean and anomuran hosts and examined coevolution between epicarideans and their crustacean hosts. The molecular phylogeny indicated that Epicaridea were monophyletic with respect to Cymothooidea. Bopyroidea formed a monophyletic group without Dajidae and Entophilinae (now as Entophilidae). Both latter taxa grouped with Cryptoniscoidea, and this group was the sister taxon to the redefined Bopyroidea in all trees. The bopyrid subfamily Ioninae is the sister taxon to the other bopyrid subfamilies (except Entophilidae). Ioninae was elevated to family status but found not to be monophyletic; a new subfamily, Keponinae, was erected for all genera formerly placed in Ioninae except the type genus. The abdominal mode of parasitism appears to have evolved independently among the subfamilies. Coevolution between host and parasite phylogenies showed extensive incongruence, indicating frequent host-switching as a general pattern in Epicaridea."

Several studies have typified species of echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks as the most important herbivores and carnivores of intertidal assemblages. Unfortunately, little is known about the diet and behavior of many consumers, making difficult addressing key issues related to the importance of omnivory, intra- and inter-specific competition, or individual specialization. The goal of this paper is to fill some gaps in the available information and provide researchers with an exhaustive dietary analysis and relevant ecological descriptors for a suite of 30 consumer species distributed along the southeastern Pacific coast. Our data integrate information collected through seasonal samplings conducted between 2004 and 2007 at 4 localities distributed over 1,000 km of coast in northern Chile. Based on laboratory and field work analysis, we present: (a) a consumer-resource matrix obtained from high-resolution analyses of gut contents of 6,377 individuals, including 222 prey items (80% identified at species or genus level); (b) estimates of the density, body size (length and weight), diet width (at individual and species levels), and within-individual diversity of consumer species; (c) an nMDS ordination of the compositional similarity of consumers' diets, and information on the relative importance and occurrence frequency of the most common preys of each consumer. Based on the high frequency of omnivory and the high diet overlap among consumers, we discuss their potential for competition and the role of individual specialization in shaping their generalist character, highlighting the need to reappraise their behavior and ecological effects in the intertidal community."

In most cases, NSI showed a better correlation with different pressures compared to AMBI. This was most pronounced in the fjords and coastal areas in Norway, less so at offshore sites in the North Sea. As a common set of taxa was used, differences in the correlations with pressures were entirely caused by different sensitivities assigned to the same taxa by NSI and AMBI.

Mesocosms were placed in the natural sea bottom and subjected to one of eight levels of biodeposition (from 0 to 1400 mussels m<sup>?2</sup>). Most analyses indicated non-linear (i.e., threshold) effects. Sediment characteristics changed significantly between 200 and 400 mussels m<sup>?2</sup> as did multivariate community structure. Community structure effects were characterised by changes in abundances of species that are very sensitive or tolerant to organic loading. The multivariate AZTI Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI) indicated that the benthic status changed from <i>High</i> to <i>Good</i> in all mesocosms receiving biodeposits. Sediments acted as a sink for oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), but results suggest O<sub>2</sub> sediment demand was not sensitive enough to evaluate organic loading impacts. Results from this and improved experiments can be used to determine the environmental carrying capacity of sites for bivalve culture."	"Robert, P.; McKindsey, C.W.; Chaillou, G.; Archambault, P."

A Biological Pollution Index was applied and evaluated. Overall 130 macrozoobenthic species were identified, 17 of which were aquatic alien species. The Szczecin Lagoon had the highest number of invasive species (13). Most species were of Pontocaspian origin; inland waterways are likely to play a significant role in their migration. According to the Biological Pollution Index Level (BPL) this lagoon was ‘moderately influenced’ by invasive species. Warnow Estuary had 11 invasive species; their origin noted generally from North-America, suggesting shipping traffic as the major distribution vector; invasive species had the same BPL as in the Szczecin Lagoon. In the Darß Zingst Bodden Chain only 6 invasive species were observed, having the highest relative abundance (9-71%). Furthermore, this area had the highest BPL of all three areas, i.e. a strong negative impact. The BPL required a lot of data (including historical) and some ratings were subjective and comparisons with other areas assessed were difficult and often impossible. Due to these limitations, it is suggested that the BPL should only be used with restrictions as a universal assessment tool for invasive species in the estuarine and lagoon waters of the Baltic Sea.

It is not known, however, to what extent their effects on biodiversity change as their cover increases, and how these effects may differ depending on the environmental context. Experimental plots with increasing cover of oysters were established within two estuaries in two different habitats commonly inhabited by <i>C. gigas</i>, (mussel-beds and mud-flats) and were sampled after 4 and 15 months. Within mud-flat habitats, macroscopic species living on or in the substratum increased in richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and number of individuals with oyster cover. In mussel-bed habitats, however, these indices were unaffected by the cover of oysters except at one estuary after 15 months when species richness was significantly lower in plots with the greatest cover of oysters. Assemblage structure differed with oyster cover in mud-flats but not in mussel-beds, except at 100 % cover in one location and at one time. Within mud-flats at one location and time (of four total tests), assemblages became more homogenous with increasing cover of oysters leading to a significant decrease in ?-diversity. These responses were primarily underpinned by the facilitation of several taxa including a grazing gastropod (<i>Littorina littorea</i>), an invasive barnacle (<i>Austrominius modestus</i>) and a primary producer (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>) with increasing cover of oysters. Although there were consistent positive effects of <i>C. gigas</i> on mud-flat biodiversity, effects were weak or negative at higher cover on mussel-beds. This highlights the need for the impacts of invasive species to be investigated at a range of invader abundances within different environmental contexts."	"Green, D.S.; Crowe, T.P."

Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of <i>C. funebralis</i> populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of <i>C. funebralis</i>, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming."

Owing to the local geographic features, this area has been described as the Venetian lacuna, where Mediterranean Sea climatic conditions are replaced by Atlantic Ocean ones, supporting the presence of glacial relicts, such as sprat <i>Sprattus sprattus</i>, flounder <i>Platichthys flesus</i> and brown shrimp <i>Crangon crangon</i>. Nektonic assemblage therefore represents a good candidate in terms of an early proxy for thermal regime alterations. It represents a dynamic component of the lagoon ecosystem, changing in space and time, actively moving through the entire system, and dynamically exchanging with the open sea. Here, the first signals of the change have been already detected, such as the presence of alien thermophilic species. Within this context, since the beginning of the century, sampling of the nektonic assemblage has been carried out, integrating them with landings data from the fish market. Vulnerabilities to thermal regime changes have been tested by (1) categorizing species according to the mean distribution area in terms of latitudinal range (over 45°, 30°–45° and below 30°), and (2) analysing both spatial and temporal variations within fishing grounds. Results indicated a high potential vulnerability of the artisanal fishery to climate change, as the commercial catch is entirely composed of species from cold (> 45° N) and temperate (between 45° and 30° N) latitudes. At present no alien thermophilic species have been recorded within the lagoon, which is possibly a sign of good resilience of the assemblage. Finally, abundance of species from cold latitudes has decreased during the past decade. All of this has been discussed in the context of the mean annual temperature trend."

We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences.ResultsSpecies distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being <i>Nucella lapillus</i>, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America.Main conclusionsMarine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences. This demonstrated utility suggests that this technique could be expanded to examine how Pleistocene and contemporary climate change might play a role in intertidal species distributions across the entire community. Future application and development of these marine and terrestrial distribution models will strengthen inferences regarding the processes generating intertidal community assembly and population divergence, and may assist in conservation planning and the design of marine reserves."

253028	2013	AS	Predicting the impact of climate change on threatened species in UK waters	"Global climate change is affecting the distribution of marine species and is thought to represent a threat to biodiversity. Previous studies project expansion of species range for some species and local extinction elsewhere under climate change. Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small. Although the models show large variation in the predicted consequences of climate change, the multi-model approach helps identify the potential risk of increased exposure to human stressors of critically endangered species such as common skate (<i>Dipturus batis</i>) and angelshark (<i>Squatina squatina</i>)."

There are 69 nonindigenous (NIS) species in the basin: 44% of these are casual (recorded just one or very few times), 28% established (widely recorded in the basin), 6% invasive (established NIS that are able rapidly or largely to disseminate away from the area of initial introduction, having a noticeable impact on the recipient community), and 22% questionable (of doubtful taxonomic status). Entry through the Suez Canal and range expansion through the Gibraltar Strait, often enhanced by ship traffic, appear to be the main processes for recent species introductions, but uncertainties remain for many NIS. Species additions immediately result in larger local or regional species pools, but the newcomers might impact on populations of native species, altering extinction probabilities.

Sixteen baited-trap samples of necrophagous amphipods were collected during three research cruises on the R.R.S. <i>James Cook</i> in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Amphipods of the superfamily Lysianassoidea are numerically dominant and taxonomically diverse and form the most important group of necrophages in most deep-sea environments.

Cave I (41–29 uncalibrated ky BP) on the Hatay coast of southern Turkey preserve a rich and varied record of early Upper Paleolithic life, including the production and use of large numbers of shell ornaments. This study examines shell bead production, use, and discard in relation to site function and the diversity of on-site human activities. Four factors are expected to contribute to variation in the ornament assemblages, one environmental and three behavioral. The behavioral factors relate to winnowing for quality as a function of distance from the raw material source, changes in the size of user groups, and symbol standardization. The accumulation rates for shell beads, bones, and stone tools paralleled one another through time, indicating that ornament discard followed the pulse of daily life at this site. All stages of manufacture and use are well represented in each assemblage, and half or more of the ornaments show evidence of extended use. Changes in the local marine environment do not explain much of the variation in the assemblages, pointing instead to behavioral causes. The richness of shell types that were collected as raw material correlates to greater exploitation of edible marine shellfish and greater occupation intensity. Much of this variation in the ornament raw material was eliminated during the manufacture stage, almost certainly reflecting the influence of cultural norms. A focus on basket-shaped shells changed remarkably little over thousands of years, despite significant changes in other domains of technology.

287992	2013	AS	Are organic falls bridging reduced environments in the Deep Sea? - Results from colonization experiments in the Gulf of Cádiz	"Organic falls create localised patches of organic enrichment and disturbance where enhanced degradation is mediated by diversified microbial assemblages and specialized fauna. The view of organic falls as “stepping stones” for the colonization of deep-sea reducing environments has been often loosely used, but much remains to be proven concerning their capability to bridge dispersal among such environments. Aiming the clarification of this issue, we used an experimental approach to answer the following questions: Are relatively small organic falls in the deep sea capable of sustaining taxonomically and trophically diverse assemblages over demographically relevant temporal scales? Are there important depth- or site-related sources of variability for the composition and structure of these assemblages? Is the proximity of other reducing environments influential for their colonization? We analysed the taxonomical and trophic diversity patterns and partitioning (?- and ?-diversity) of the macrofaunal assemblages recruited in small colonization devices with organic and inorganic substrata after 1-2 years of deployment on mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cádiz. Our results show that small organic falls can sustain highly diverse and trophically coherent assemblages for time periods allowing growth to reproductive maturity, and successive generations of dominant species. The composition and structure of the assemblages showed variability consistent with their biogeographic and bathymetric contexts. However, the proximity of cold seeps had limited influence on the similarity between the assemblages of these two habitats and organic falls sustained a distinctive fauna with dominant substrate-specific taxa. We conclude that it is unlikely that small organic falls may regularly ensure population connectivity among cold seeps and vents.

288075	2013	AS	"Content assessment of the primary biodiversity data published through GBIF network: status, challenges and potentials"	"With the establishment of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in 2001 as an inter-governmental co-ordinating body, concerted efforts were made during the past decade to establish a global research infrastructure to facilitate the sharing, discovery and access to primary biodiversity data. As on date the participants in GBIF have enabled the discovery and access to over 267+ million such data records. While this remarkable achievement in terms of volume of data must be acknowledged, concerns about the quality and ‘fitness-for-use’ of the data should also be carefully considered in future developments. This contribution is therefore a direct response to the calls for comprehensive content assessment of the GBIF mobilised data. It is the first comprehensive assessment of the coverage of the content mobilised so far through GBIF, as well as a mean to identify the existing gaps and reflect on fitness-for-use requirements. This paper describes the complementary methodologies adopted by the GBIF Secretariat and University of Navarra for the development of a comprehensive content assessment. Outcomes of these research initiatives are summarised in four categories, namely, (a) data quality assessment, (b) trends/patterns assessment, (c) fitness-for-use assessment, and (d) ecosystem specific data diversity assessment. In conclusion we make specific suggestions to the GBIF community on the adoption of common indicators to assess progress towards future targets as well as recommendations to populate such exercise at various levels within the GBIF Network from national level to thematic levels."

Evaluating data from a highly dynamic ecosystem	"One of the most controversially discussed topics in current biodiversity-ecosystem function research is the transfer of results from experimental and theoretical studies to natural ecosystems. At the same time, monitoring data on biodiversity are requested as key indicators for the state of an ecosystem in most environmental evaluation frameworks. We analyse two monitoring data sets comprising information on abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos communities in the German Wadden Sea in order to evaluate how much information monitoring data on biodiversity provide concerning ecosystem functioning and what implications this information (or the lack thereof) has for future monitoring programmes. Our results show a positive correlation between number of species of macrozoobenthos and its standing stock. Despite differences in overall biomass and individual size in different functional groups, this correlation remained consistent for different feeding guilds and therefore is likely to be independent of certain species traits. Moreover, functional turnover analyses indicate that increasing species richness is needed to maintain biomass levels over increasing periods of time. Whereas our data thus corroborate predictions from theory, we could not determine any causal relationships, because monitoring data commonly include only vague proxies for very few functional parameters, in our case standing biomass as a proxy for production. As to the use of diversity as an indicator for ecosystem functioning, we advise that management decisions are to be based on verified causal relationships and therefore strongly suggest the general incorporation of unambiguous proxies for functional parameters in the measuring campaigns of monitoring programmes."

287932	2013	AS	Insights into the toxicological properties of a low molecular weight fraction from <i>Zoanthus sociatus</i> (Cnidaria)	"The phylum Cnidaria is an ancient group of venomous animals, specialized in the production and delivery of toxins. Many species belonging to the class Anthozoa have been studied and their venoms often contain a group of peptides, less than 10 kDa, that act upon ion channels. These peptides and their targets interact with high affinity producing neurotoxic and cardiotoxic effects, and even death, depending on the dose and the administration pathway. Zoanthiniaria is an order of the Subclass Hexacorallia, class Anthozoa, and unlike sea anemone (order Actiniaria), neither its diversity of toxins nor the <i>in vivo</i> effects of the venoms has been exhaustively explored. In this study we assessed some toxicological tests on mice with a low molecular weight fraction obtained by gel filtration in Sephadex G-50 from <i>Zoanthus sociatus</i> crude extract. The gel filtration chromatogram at 280 nm revealed two major peaks, the highest absorbance corresponding to the low molecular weight fraction. The toxicological effects seem to be mostly autonomic and cardiotoxic, causing death in a dose dependent manner with a LD50 of 792 ?g/kg. Moreover, at a dose of 600 ?g/kg the active fraction accelerated the KCl-induced lethality in mice.

Short taxonomic histories of the initial records and names of Scleractinia and Octocorallia found in Bermuda culminate in complete and up-to-date lists of the currently accepted species. There are 26 species of shallow-water azooxanthellate and zooxanthellate scleractinians, and 23 species of deep water azooxanthellate scleractinians reported from within the Bermuda EEZ; 25 species of shallow-water octocorallians and 33 of deep-water octocorals; and eight antipatharians.

288082	2013	AS	Not all sponges will thrive in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> ocean: review of the mineralogy of calcifying sponges	"Most marine sponges precipitate silicate skeletal elements, and it has been predicted that they would be among the few “winners” among invertebrates in an acidifying, high-CO<sub>2</sub> ocean. But members of Class Calcarea and a small proportion of the Demospongiae have calcified skeletal structures, which puts them among those calcifying organisms which are vulnerable to lowered pH and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>=</sup> availability. A review of carbonate mineralogy in marine sponges (75 specimens, 32 species), along with new data from New Zealand (42 specimens in 15 species) allows us to investigate patterns and make predictions. In general sponges show little variability within individuals and within species (± 0.5 wt.% MgCO<sub>3</sub> in calcite). Extant sponges in Class Calcarea generally produce calcitic spicules with relatively high Mg contents, up to 15 wt.% MgCO<sub>3</sub>. Whereas most of the calcifying demosponges are aragonitic, the genus <i>Acanthochaetetes</i> in the order Hadromerida produces extremely high-Mg calcite (14 to 18 wt.% MgCO<sub>3</sub>). There is generally a weak phylogenetic consistency among classes, orders and families. Statistical analyses, including those accounting for these phylogenetic effects, fail to find a substantial or significant effect of water temperature on mineralogical variation. In the context of global ocean acidification, sponges which produce high-Mg calcite and/or aragonite will be most vulnerable to dissolution, meaning that not all sponges will be “winners” in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> ocean."

282300	2013	AS	Which environmental factors control phytoplankton populations? A Bayesian variable selection approach	"The structure of phytoplankton communities is thought to influence total productivity, trophic structure and the export of carbon below the mixed layer. Community structure is determined by a complex interaction between the physiological characteristics of each species, environmental conditions, resource availability, competition among species, and numerous loss terms. This complexity makes it very difficult to predict how changes in environmental conditions will alter the structure of phytoplankton communities. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with variable selection to identify how temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations determine the abundance of the 67 dominant identified species at Station CARIACO in the Caribbean Sea. This approach allows us to overcome the statistical challenge presented by the highly correlated environmental variables. Approximately three-quarters of the variables for each species have little effect on phytoplankton abundance. About half of the species decline in abundance with increasing temperature. Diatom species’ abundances are much more likely to respond to changes in irradiance and nitrate concentration than dinoflagellates and dinoflagellate species’ abundances are more likely to respond to changes in salinity."

Biological assessments revealed clearly distinct phases, elucidating the definitive shift of this human-induced coastal lake from a freshwater to a marine-influenced lagoon ecosystem.

Faunal and ecological insights are offered for its current malacofauna, and special emphasis is given to alien spe¬cies.

Animal remains recovered from archaeological sites in the region represent subfossil baseline Late Holocene ecological samples that provide an opportunity to examine past human subsistence behavior in a coastal environment dominated by bays, coral reefs, and extensive mangrove stands. We examine marine mollusc and vertebrate remains from the archaeological locality of Sitio Drago and illustrate evidence of potential pre-Columbian human impacts on the local environment.

Based on the examination of the type material and series of specimens from private collections, and of recent findings from Sardinia, we reviewed and updated the distribution of this species, and figured the three representative shell colour morphs which are constant in local populations. A comparative SEM analysis did not outline significant differences among shells with greatly different colour patterns, thus justifying their belonging to a single specific entity. The survey of the material of <i>J. baudoni</i> did not show a strict correspondence between Corse and Sardinian shell colour morphs and their geographical distribution, not allowing to clearly state trends and relationships among island populations. On the contrary the colour pattern of the continental shells of <i>J. baudoni</i> seems to be constant and different from the ones of the island shells, indicating a well separated colour morph. This study confirmed that the distribution of <i>J. baudoni</i> is limited to the north-western Mediterranean Sea, with its eastern range widened to the La Maddalena Archipelago (Sardinia). The record of this species from Azores is due to a misidentification with <i>J. pseudogravinae</i> Nordsieck, 1973, which is also figured for comparison.

In this study we report on a fragmentary Miocene-Pliocene fossil marine shell, <i>Aspa marginata</i>, discovered in a Discoid Mousterian layer of the Fumane Cave, northern Italy, dated to at least 47.6-45.0 Cal ky BP. The shell was collected by Neandertals at a fossil exposure probably located more than 100 kms from the site. Microscopic analysis of the shell surface identifies clusters of striations on the inner lip. A dark red substance, trapped inside micropits produced by bioeroders, is interpreted as pigment that was homogeneously smeared on the outer shell surface. Dispersive X-ray and Raman analysis identify the pigment as pure hematite. Of the four hypotheses we considered to explain the presence of this object at the site, two (tool, pigment container) are discarded because in contradiction with observations. Although the other two (“manuport”, personal ornament) are both possible, we favor the hypothesis that the object was modified and suspended by a ‘thread’ for visual display as a pendant. Together with contextual and chronometric data, our results support the hypothesis that deliberate transport and coloring of an exotic object, and perhaps its use as pendant, was a component of Neandertal symbolic culture, well before the earliest appearance of the anatomically modern humans in Europe."

287676	2013	AS	The curious case of <i>Hermodice carunculata</i> (Annelida: Amphinomidae): evidence for genetic homogeneity throughout the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent basins	"Over the last few decades, advances in molecular techniques have led to the detection of strong geographic population structure and cryptic speciation in many benthic marine taxa, even those with long-lived pelagic larval stages. Polychaete annelids, in particular, generally show a high degree of population divergence, especially in mitochondrial genes. Rarely have molecular studies confirmed the presence of ‘cosmopolitan’ species. The amphinomid polychaete <i>Hermodice carunculata</i> was long considered the sole species within its genus, with a reported distribution throughout the Atlantic and adjacent basins. However, recent studies have indicated morphological differences, primarily in the number of branchial filaments, between the East and West Atlantic populations; these differences were invoked to re-instate <i>Hermodice nigrolineata</i>, formerly considered a junior synonym of <i>H. carunculata</i>. We utilized sequence data from two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) markers and one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) marker to examine the genetic diversity of <i>Hermodice</i> throughout its distribution range in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea. Our analyses revealed generally low genetic divergences among collecting localities and between the East and West Atlantic, although phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial data indicate the presence of a private lineage in the Mediterranean Sea. A re-evaluation of the number of branchial filaments confirmed differences between East and West Atlantic populations; however, the differences were not diagnostic and did not reflect the observed genetic population structure. Rather, we suspect that the number of branchial filaments is a function of oxygen saturation in the environment. Our results do not support the distinction between <i>H. carunculata</i> in the West Atlantic and<i> H. nigrolineata </i>in the East Atlantic. Instead, they re-affirm the older notion that <i>H. carunculata </i> is a cohesive species with a broad distribution across the Atlantic Ocean."

During the DIVA 1 cruise of RV METEOR (July/August 2000) to the Angola Basin (Southeast Atlantic), two deep-sea stations, approximately 300 nautical miles apart (Stations 325 and 346), were sampled repeatedly by Multicorer (MUC). For quantitative analyses, 5 MUC samples were selected at random from each of 15 deployments at both stations, totalling 75 cores. Across the study, 7,081 Harpacticoida specimens were encountered and of these 31.4 % were adults and could be analysed to species level: 682 species were identified, with 99.3 % new to science. At northern Station 346, a total of 600 species were recorded—the highest harpacticoid species number ever recorded for a single deep-sea locality. Most species (56 %) were represented by singletons. Multivariate tests identified significant differences between community compositions at the two stations. Diversity, species richness and species density were higher at Station 346, whilst taxonomic distinctness, evenness, and rarefaction were similar between stations. Regression and correlation analyses showed that the difference in species diversity was best explained by species densities rather than species richness. Under-sampling due to low densities was an issue at the southern Station 325. Nevertheless, our study demonstrated significant differences in regional-scale harpacticoid community structures within a single deep-sea basin that would usually be considered a uniform and stable habitat. These observed differences are thought to reflect differences in food availability at the two stations."

Since climate changes cause a progressive expansion of ice-free intertidal soft-bottom areas, the fauna of these areas could serve as essential criterion to evaluate the kind and dimension of such changes. We therefore investigated the faunal composition of the intertidal soft-bottom area of Maxwell Bay (King George Island, South Shetlands) in December 2006. Samples for quantitative analyses were taken from the soft-bottom during low tide using a plastic corer. We performed detailed analyses of the soft-bottom beneath a cobble layer, while hard-bottom and macrophytes were only sporadically investigated. Approximately 5,000 specimens were collected of which polychaetes (37.3 ± 7.6 (max. 44.7) ind. × 100 cm?³) and harpacticoids (28.9 ± 28.5 (max. 104.0) ind. × 10 cm?³) were the most abundant macro- and meiofauna taxa of the soft-bottom, followed by oligochaetes, nematodes, mollusks, and amphipods. A total of 58 macrofauna species were registered, of which 27 were identified only to a supraspecific level. The most species-rich macrofauna taxon was polychaetes with at least 24 species, followed by amphipods, gastropods, and oligochaetes with 6 species each. The harpacticoid copepods were represented by 15 families with more than 30 species. In summary, we show that the Antarctic intertidal soft-bottom is densely populated by macro- and meiofauna and that it deserves closer attention in the future to determine whether it can indeed serve as an indicator of the effect of climate changes on the Antarctic coastal areas."

The scale similarity is examined by using a taxonomic metrics based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and a related index of similarity.2 - Data were collected monthly during one year in four dominant habitat types, which were classified on the basis of main physiognomic traits (type of vegetation and anthropogenic impact). Three of the selected habitats were natural (macroalgal beds, bare sediment and Phragmitetum) and one anthropogenically modified (the licensed area for Manila clam farming). Each habitat was sampled in a variable number of stations representative of specific microhabitats, with three replicates each.3 - Of the 47 taxa identified, only few species were found exclusively in one habitat type, with low densities. No taxon was dominant in all the considered habitats.4 - The results show that, in spite of the large overlapping of species, the spatio-temporal dissimilarity within each habitat type was higher than expected on the basis of the common physiognomic traits. This suggests that local factors (mainly hydrodynamism, quality and quantity of vegetal matter) play a significant role in determining the structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages.5 - The dissimilarity between habitats was significant and maintained all over the seasonal progression, indicating that the macroinvertebrate assemblages were steadily different. Each habitat allowed some specific taxa to maintain a significant population size, which is a prerequisite for preserving biodiversity.6 - The variety of vegetation types and hydrodynamic conditions in the lagoon emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity and capacity to recover from disturbances."

Their productivity has been correlated with terrigeneous inputs entering the coastal–estuarine benthic food web, thereby favouring the establishment of fish juveniles. Studies in these ecosystems often describe the nursery as a single large habitat without verifying nor considering the presence of contiguous habitats. Our study aimed at identifying different habitats based on macrozoobenthic communities and morpho-sedimentary characteristics and assessing the trophic interactions between fish juveniles and their benthic preys within these habitats. It included 43 sampling sites covering 5 habitats in which we described taxonomically and quantitatively the invertebrates and fish communities with stable isotopes and gut contents. It suggested that the benthic common sole <i>Solea solea</i> displayed feeding plasticity at the population level, separating the juveniles (G0) from the older fish (G1) into different “feeding sub-populations”. Size-based feeding plasticity was also observable in the spatial occupancy of that species in the studied bay. The demersal pouting, <i>Trisopterus luscus</i>, equally used the different habitats but displayed low feeding plasticity across and inside each habitat. Stable isotopes proved to be powerful tools to study the spatial distribution of trophic interactions in complex ecosystems like the bay of Vilaine and to define optimal habitats for fish that use the coastal–estuarine ecosystem as nursery grounds."

Great strides have been made in the past decade establishing a framework for sharing data, where taxonomy and systematics has been perceived as the most prominent discipline involved. To some extent this is inevitable, given the use of species names as the pivot around which information is organised. To address the urgent questions around conservation, land-use, environmental change, sustainability, food security and ecosystem services that are facing Governments worldwide, we need to understand how the ecosystem works. So, we need a systems approach to understanding biodiversity that moves significantly beyond taxonomy and species observations. Such an approach needs to look at the whole system to address species interactions, both with their environment and with other species. It is clear that some barriers to progress are sociological, basically persuading people to use the technological solutions that are already available. This is best addressed by developing more effective systems that deliver immediate benefit to the user, hiding the majority of the technology behind simple user interfaces. An infrastructure should be a space in which activities take place and, as such, should be effectively invisible. This community consultation paper positions the role of biodiversity informatics, for the next decade, presenting the actions needed to link the various biodiversity infrastructures invisibly and to facilitate understanding that can support both business and policy-makers. The community considers the goal in biodiversity informatics to be full integration of the biodiversity research community, including citizens’ science, through a commonly-shared, sustainable e-infrastructure across all sub-disciplines that reliably serves science and society alike."

The 75 component species and their populations were highly variably distributed across the site, abundances of the individual dominant animals being significantly patchy and composition of the macrofaunal assemblage being significantly non-uniform. Nevertheless, emergent assemblage attributes exhibited spatial constancy: values of assemblage metrics (faunal abundance, species richness, species density and species diversity) did not differ across the site or across spatial scales, and neither did the patterns of dispersion of species diversity, species richness or observed species density. Distribution of the 2 latter through space was even significantly uniform. Ecological arguments developed for temporal constancy of biodiversity seem broadly applicable to the spatial dimension at Knysna, suggesting that although apparently paradoxical, it may be the varying assemblage composition that permits this spatial stability. There is no evidence, however, that the Knysna seagrass macrobenthos is a competitively-structured assemblage with rigid niche-partitioning, a condition suggested to be necessary for temporal constancy; rather, it is more likely to be open, non-equilibrium and below carrying capacity."

Due to their close phylogenetic relationship with seep species and tiny mussels from organic substrates, it was hypothesized that they gradually evolved from shallow to deeper environments, and specialized in decaying organic remains, then in seeps, and finally colonized deep-sea vents. Here, we present a multigene phylogeny that reveals that most of the genera are polyphyletic and/or paraphyletic. The robustness of the phylogeny allows us to revise the genus-level classification. Organic remains are robustly supported as the ancestral habitat for Bathymodiolinae. However, rather than a single step toward colonization of vents and seeps, recurrent habitat shifts from organic substrates to vents and seeps occurred during evolution, and never the reverse. This new phylogenetic framework challenges the gradualist scenarios “from shallow to deep.” Mussels from organic remains tolerate a large range of ecological conditions and display a spectacular species diversity contrary to vent mussels, although such habitats are yet underexplored compared to vents and seeps. Overall, our data suggest that for deep-sea mussels, the high specialization to vent habitats provides ecological success in this harsh habitat but also brings the lineage to a kind of evolutionary dead end."

This revealed 46 gastropod and 29 bivalve species, along with scleractinian corals, encrusting bryozoans, polychaete tubes, barnacles, and echinoids. The fauna is characteristic of intertidal and nearshore rocky substrates and sandy soft-bottom habitats. Sedimentological analysis is consistent with faunal data and indicates an upper shoreface paleoenvironment along a gravel coast. This diverse fauna stands out as a rare example of a marine Pleistocene assemblage from over 6,000 km of the West African coast. The assemblage is dominated by extant tropical West African molluscs, including species from the “Senegalese fauna” that colonized northern Africa and beyond during Pleistocene interstadials. Additionally, as along the modern coast of the Namibe Desert, the influence of the cool-water Benguela Current is apparent in the paleofauna by the occurrence of a few temperate species. The distribution and thermal tolerances of extant species identified in the Pipas fauna indicate that this region experienced similar climatic and oceanographic conditions as that of the present during this interstadial. Seasonal temperature varied between ?20 and 28°C and resulted from upwelling in this tropical setting."	"Sessa, J.A.; Callapez, P.M.; Dinis, P.A.; Hendy, A.J.W."	WOS:000327359000005

In this study we elucidate species-specific absorption and corresponding reflection signatures of marine organisms and discuss optical fingerprints from underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI) for future automated identification of organisms on the seafloor. When mounted on underwater robots, UHI has the potential to be a time- and cost-efficient identification and mapping method covering large areas over a short time. Hyperspectral imaging in vivo and in situ were used to obtain species-specific reflection signatures (optical fingerprints). High performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance were used for pigment identification and to obtain species-specific absorption signatures of four marine benthic species; the spoonworm <i>Bonellia viridis</i>, and the sponges <i>Isodictya palmata, Hymedesmia paupertas</i> and <i>Hymedesima</i> sp.

288121	2013	AS	Deglacial to postglacial palaeoenvironments of the Celtic Sea: lacustrine conditions versus a continuous marine sequence	"Recent work on the last glaciation of the British Isles has led to an improved understanding of the nature and timing of the retreat of the British?Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) from its southern maximum (Isles of Scilly), northwards into the Celtic and Irish seas. However, the nature of the deglacial environments across the Celtic Sea shelf, the extent of subaerial exposure and the existence (or otherwise) of a contiguous terrestrial linkage between Britain and Ireland following ice retreat remains ambiguous. Multiproxy research, based on analysis of 12 BGS vibrocores from the Celtic Deep Basin (CDB), seeks to address these issues. CDB cores exhibit a shell-rich upward fining sequence of Holocene marine sand above an erosional contact cut in laminated muds with infrequent lonestones. Molluscs, <i>in situ</i> Foraminifera and marine diatoms are absent from the basal muds, but rare damaged freshwater diatoms and foraminiferal linings occur. Dinoflagellate cysts and other non-pollen palynomorphs evidence diverse, environmentally incompatible floras with temperate, boreal and Arctic glaciomarine taxa co-occurring. Such multiproxy records can be interpreted as representing a retreating ice margin, with reworking of marine sediments into a lacustrine basin. Equally, the same record may be interpreted as recording similar conditions within a semi-enclosed marine embayment dominated by meltwater export and deposition of reworked microfossils. As assemblages from these cores contrast markedly with proven glaciomarine sequences from outside the CDB, a glaciolacustrine interpretation is favoured for the laminated sequence, truncated by a Late Weichselian transgressive sequence fining upwards into fully marine conditions. Reworked rare intertidal molluscs from immediately above the regional unconformity provide a minimum date c.?13.9?cal. ka BP for commencement of widespread marine erosion. Although suggestive of glaciolacustrine conditions, the exact nature and timing of laminated sediment deposition within the CDB, and the implications this has on (pen) insularity of Ireland following deglaciation, remain elusive."

288241	2013	AS	The taxonomic name resolution service: an online tool for automated standardization of plant names	"The digitization of biodiversity data is leading to the widespread application of taxon names that are superfluous, ambiguous or incorrect, resulting in mismatched records and inflated species numbers. The ultimate consequences of misspelled names and bad taxonomy are erroneous scientific conclusions and faulty policy decisions. The lack of tools for correcting this ‘names problem’ has become a fundamental obstacle to integrating disparate data sources and advancing the progress of biodiversity science. The TNRS, or Taxonomic Name Resolution Service, is an online application for automated and user-supervised standardization of plant scientific names. The TNRS builds upon and extends existing open-source applications for name parsing and fuzzy matching. Names are standardized against multiple reference taxonomies, including the Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database. Capable of processing thousands of names in a single operation, the TNRS parses and corrects misspelled names and authorities, standardizes variant spellings, and converts nomenclatural synonyms to accepted names. Family names can be included to increase match accuracy and resolve many types of homonyms. Partial matching of higher taxa combined with extraction of annotations, accession numbers and morphospecies allows the TNRS to standardize taxonomy across a broad range of active and legacy datasets. We show how the TNRS can resolve many forms of taxonomic semantic heterogeneity, correct spelling errors and eliminate spurious names. As a result, the TNRS can aid the integration of disparate biological datasets. Although the TNRS was developed to aid in standardizing plant names, its underlying algorithms and design can be extended to all organisms and nomenclatural codes. The TNRS is accessible via a web interface at http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/ and as a RESTful web service and application programming interface.

The marine Bakalskoye Lake (Ukraine) was studied in 2000-2012. The paper considers changing crustaceans within the context of the lagoon changes. A sharp drop of salinity occurred in 2004 due to a changed wind rose because the strong winds of Western direction began to dominate, and as a result, washing away of the spit began to be more intensive; and marine water inflow into the lake increased. The structure of primary productivity has changed completely; the total primary production decreased. A list of crustacean species found in the lake includes 19 species. In 2004 there was a change of the composition of crustaceans due to three factors - a change of salinity, an increase of erosion, and massive transport of marine organisms into the lake. Integral characteristics of zooplankton also significantly changed. Impact of climate change on crustaceans is not only direct, but through an extensive network of intermediate effects which are discussed. The study results are of more than local relevance; it has a general ecological importance because can help to better understand that the realizations of general climate change impacts on local level are diverse."

The same pattern of transition was manifested in each lattice. Macrofaunal abundance, species density (both observed and estimated total) and assemblage composition did not vary with distance away from the interface within the 0.75 m wide marginal bands of each habitat type. Neither were there significant differences in assemblage metrics or composition between the marginal and non-edge regions of either habitat. There were, however, very marked differences in assemblage composition, abundance and species density across the 25 cm wide strip on either side of the actual interface, the interacting assemblages reacting symmetrically. All these differences therefore took place over an ecotone distance of only 0.5 m at most. Spatial trends in assemblage metrics across the boundary zone were captured accurately by second and third order polynomial regression models. It also appeared that edge effects on individual species within the seagrass were a variable local response not a consistent effect of closeness to the bare sand."	"Barnes, R.S.K.; Hamylton, S."

Calculation of the Multivariate-AZTI Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI) EQR is based on the proportions of sensitive and stress tolerant benthic invertebrate species, number of species and Shannon–Wiener diversity. The sensitivity of many tropical/sub-tropical taxa has not yet been determined, presenting a barrier to the direct transfer of WFD EQRs, and the ideas underpinning them, to the management of coastal waters beyond Europe. To overcome this we examine using higher taxonomic level data with M-AMBI.

Before applying such approaches to assessing ES in new geographical regions it is essential to determine the effects of using higher taxonomic level data on M-AMBI in areas where the tool was developed. To this end, we use macrofaunal data from three well studied sites in north-western Europe to examine the effects of using taxonomic level data higher than species on M-AMBI. Using the European datasets M-AMBI ES classification was shown to be robust to changes in taxonomic level data. We test the suitability of family-level M-AMBI for assessing ES in subtropical Hong Kong waters. Family level M-AMBI was useful in detecting stress in Hong Kong, where it successfully detected temporal and spatial shifts in ES in response to seasonal hypoxia and salinity variability, and anthropogenic organic enrichment."

312838	2013	AS	Nematode succession at deep-sea hydrothermal vents after a recent volcanic eruption with the description of two dominant species	"Nematodes are very common in the deep sea and are an important component of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities. In early 2006, the eruption of the underwater volcano at 9°50’N East Pacific Rise wiped out almost the entire faunal communities of the area. This provided us with the opportunity to study nematode primary succession at vents as well as on adjacent seafloor basalt. Nematode abundance and richness were extremely low at all studied sites in late 2006 and 2007, and increased only slightly in 2009. Interestingly, the most abundant species during early succession were also prominent in this area prior to the eruption. Our results show that nematodes are extremely influenced by volcanic eruptions and need a long period of time to colonize the lava-flooded area in greater numbers and richness. We hypothesize that low food availability on the young bare basalt and harsh environmental conditions at early succession vent sites might hinder a more successful nematode establishment. In addition to the newly established active vent sites we also studied an inactive vent site that was not directly hit by the eruption but whose vent fluid had ceased after the eruption. At this inactive and older vent, diversity was also relatively low but was higher than at the younger, newly established sites. In addition to the ecological analyses, we here describe the two most abundant species found at inactive vents, namely <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Neochromadora</em> aff. <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">poecilosoma</em> De Mann 1893 and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Linhomoeus caudipapillosus</em> sp. n."

"The objective of this study was to test the hypotheses that (1) free-living marine nematodes respond in a differential way to diesel fuel if it is combined with three trace metals (chromium, copper, and nickel) used as smoke suppressants and that (2) the magnitude of toxicity of diesel fuel differs according to the level of trace metal mixture added. Nematodes from Sidi Salem beach (Tunisia) were subjected separately for 30&nbsp;days to three doses of diesel fuel and three others of a trace metals mixture. Simultaneously, low-dose diesel was combined with three amounts of a trace metal mixture. Results from univariate and multivariate methods of data evaluation generally support our initial hypothesis that nematode assemblages exhibit various characteristic changes when exposed to different types of disturbances; the low dose of diesel fuel, discernibly non-toxic alone, became toxic when trace metals were added. For all types of treatments, biological disturbance caused severe specific changes in assemblage structure. For diesel fuel-treated microcosms, <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Marylynnia bellula</em> and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Chromaspirinia pontica</em> were the best positive indicative species; their remarkable presence in given ecosystem may predict unsafe seafood.

312887	2013	AS	High meiofaunal and nematodes diversity around mesophotic coral oases in the Mediterranean sea	"Although the mesophotic zone of the Mediterranean Sea has been poorly investigated, there is an increasing awareness about its ecological importance for its biodiversity, as fish nursery and for the recruitment of shallow water species. Along with coastal rocky cliffs, isolated coralligenous concretions emerging from muddy bottoms are typical structures of the Mediterranean Sea mesophotic zone. Coralligenous concretions at mesophotic depths in the South Tyrrhenian Sea were investigated to assess the role of these coralligenous oases in relation to the biodiversity of surrounding soft sediments. We show here that the complex structures of the coralligenous concretions at ca. 110 m depth influence the trophic conditions, the biodiversity and assemblage composition in the surrounding sediments even at considerable distances. Coral concretions not only represent deep oases of coral biodiversity but they also promote a higher biodiversity of the fauna inhabiting the surrounding soft sediments. Using the biodiversity of nematodes as a proxy of the total benthic biodiversity, a high turnover biodiversity within a 200 m distance from the coralligenous concretions was observed. Such turnover is even more evident when only rare taxa are considered and seems related to specific trophic conditions, which are influenced by the presence of the coralligenous structures. The presence of a high topographic complexity and the trophic enrichment make these habitats highly biodiverse, nowadays endangered by human activities (such as exploitation of commercial species such as <em>Corallium rubrum</em>, or trawling fisheries, which directly causes habitat destruction or indirectly causes modification in the sedimentation and re-suspension rates). We stress that the protection of the coralligenous sea concretions is a priority for future conservation policies at the scale of large marine ecosystems and that a complete census of these mesophotic oases of biodiversity should be a priority for future investigations in the Mediterranean Sea."

312936	2013	AS	Major consequences of an intense dense shelf water cascading event on deep-sea benthic trophic conditions and meiofaunal biodiversity	"Numerous submarine canyons around the world are preferential conduits for episodic dense shelf water cascading (DSWC), which quickly modifies physical and chemical ambient conditions while transporting large amounts of material towards the base of slope and basin. Observations conducted during the last 20 yr in the Lacaze-Duthiers and Cap de Creus canyons (Gulf of Lion, NW Mediterranean Sea) report several intense DSWC events. The effects of DSWC on deep-sea ecosystems are almost unknown. To investigate the effects of these episodic events, we analysed changes in the meiofaunal biodiversity inside and outside the canyon. Sediment samples were collected at depths varying from ca. 1000 to > 2100 m in May 2004 (before a major event), April 2005 (during a major cascading event) and in October 2005, August 2006, April 2008 and April 2009 (after a major event). We report here that the late winter–early spring 2005 cascading led to a reduction of the organic matter contents in canyon floor sediments down to 1800 m depth, whereas surface sediments at about 2200 m depth showed an increase. Our findings suggest that the nutritional material removed from the shallower continental shelf, canyon floor and flanks, and also the adjacent open slope was rapidly transported to the deep margin. During the cascading event the meiofaunal abundance and biodiversity in the studied deep-sea sediments were significantly lower than after the event. Benthic assemblages during the cascading were significantly different from those in all other sampling periods in both the canyon and deep margin. After only six months from the cessation of the cascading, benthic assemblages in the impacted sediments were again similar to those observed in other sampling periods, thus illustrating a quick recovery. Since the present climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of these episodic events, we anticipate that they will increasingly affect benthic bathyal ecosystems, which may eventually challenge their resilience."

Taxonomic and functional approaches were taken to describe the assemblage structure and relate it to the abiotic environment based on a sampling scheme involving three stations and four seasons. The analysis of the nematode communities suggested that heated effluent influenced the assemblage structure or the spatial distribution of the taxa studied. The abundance of the nematodes differed significantly among seasons and stations and the numbers of species also differed significantly between stations. The seasonal variation was greater in winter and summer than in spring and autumn. The numbers of species and their abundances were highest at station 3 (impact station), attributable to the increased bottom temperature. However, the functional diversity of the assemblages did not change notably between stations or seasons. Species such as <i>Sabatieria</i> sp. (34%), <i>Linhystera</i> sp. (18%) and <i>Parodontophora</i> sp<i>.</i> (11%) were usually dominant in all seasons and at all stations. <i>Parodontophora</i> sp<i>.</i> displayed a significantly negative correlation with the bottom temperature (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05).

The 3 algal phenotypes (‘fine’, ‘green’, ‘wild’) differed in morphology, as well as nutritional value (organic content). When presented with the 3 <i>G. cornea</i> phenotypes simultaneously, the amphipod <i>Ampithoe ramondi</i> and the crab <i>Acanthonyx lunulatus</i> consumed significantly more of the finely branched phenotype (63 and 80% of total consumption, respectively) than of either the green or wild phenotypes. When confined with only 1 of the 3 algal phenotypes, feeding patterns of the crab changed little, consuming significantly more of the finely branched phenotype. In contrast, the amphipod responded by increasing consumption proportionally on the phenotypes with the lowest organic content. Regression analysis showed that <i>A. ramondi</i> exhibited compensatory feeding and consumed significantly more of the green phenotype than of either of the other 2 under no-choice conditions, with algal ash-free dry mass explaining approximately 83% of the variance in feeding for this mesograzer. Data suggest that feeding by crabs responded to algal morphology more, while amphipods cued on both structure and nutrient content of the algal phenotypes."	"Cruz-Rivera, E.; Friedlander, M."

The zooplankton community was characterized by the absence of any significant spatial or seasonal variation in density, diversity or evenness. However, density was significantly higher during the ebb tides, with mean values ranging from 4,967±670.0 ind.m<sup>-3</sup> in July (flood tide) to 38,213±15,157 ind.m<sup>-3</sup> in April (ebb tide). A similar tidal pattern was recorded for the density of copepods. The dominant copepod species were <i>Euterpina acutifrons</i> (47.0±30.5 to 18,313±2,431 ind.m<sup>-3</sup>) and <i>Paracalanus quasimodo</i> (420.0±60.0 to 11,260±7,203 ind.m<sup>-3</sup>) and, together with <i>Oithona hebes</i> and <i>O. oswaldocruzi</i>, were responsible for the peaks in zooplankton density recorded in April. Monthly zooplankton diversity (1.8±0.2 to 3.0±0.1 bits.ind<sup>-1</sup>) was relatively high overall, whereas evenness varied from 0.4±0.0 to 0.8±0.0, with both indices presenting significantly lower values in November. The absence of any significant seasonal trend in total zooplankton during the present study may have been related to atypical precipitation patterns during the study period, when surface waters were abnormally warm (~1.5°C). Overall, zooplankton community structure at Ajuruteua Beach was indirectly related to the local rainfall regime, which affected the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water, influencing the temporal dynamics of these organisms."

These analyses provide an overview of the development of these estuaries over the last ?7500 years. Palynological data reveal climate-driven vegetational shifts over the whole period. Microfauna, which is composed predominantly of foraminifers and ostracods, provides evidence for periods of marine and brackish water conditions, observed in both estuaries. Whereas the sediment record from the Alvor estuary shows a clear, nearly continuous silting-up sequence, the development of the Alcantarilha estuary is characterised by fluvial sedimentation, replaced by a marine environment at about 7300 yr cal BP. Marine transgression is indicated by marine-brackish foraminifera and ostracod assemblages, while upper-marsh pollen decreased and wetland communities increased at the same time. A continuous shallowing of the estuaries followed between ?6700 yr cal BP and ?5700 yr cal BP in Alvor and 4500 yr cal BP in Alcantarilha. This was interrupted by a distinct high-energy event, possibly a storm or tsunami, between 6400 and 5800 yr cal BP in Alvor; the event was not recorded in the Alcantarilha estuary. Afterwards, the silting-up restarted with clear similarities to the pre-event situation and continued until ?3500/2000 yr cal BP. This process was influenced by the build-up of sand barriers in front of the estuaries. This is also documented by a higher percentage of upper-marsh vegetation. The core from Alcantarilha estuary shows another layer of high-energy deposits, with mainly marine foraminifers and ostracods after 4500 yr cal BP. The youngest parts of the two records are characterised by decreasing tidal influence and increasing anthropogenic impact, indicated by increasing values of cultivated plants and other human-induced changes of vegetation cover."

They are isolated islands of coral origin, without permanent human population. This situation makes them good candidates to evaluate the evolution of biodiversity without direct anthropogenic influences. Knowledge is still scarce because their accessibility is limited.

Among several aims, the program BioReCIE (Biodiversity, Resources and Conservation of Eparses Islands) was to complete the inventories of several marine groups, including the echinoderms, which had never been assessed before. In November 2011, a multidisciplinary team explored the reef slopes of the island by scuba diving down to 20 meters (10 sites), and the reef flats at low tide (14 sites, including the lagoon surrounded by mangrove), collecting and taking photos of the organisms which have been preserved in 95% ethanol and identified.

This is particularly evident for the deep sea, the largest biome of the biosphere, where information on the scales of spatial variation is very scant. Here, we investigated deep-sea nematodes species richness, turnover and functional diversity, and life strategies at different spatial scales (from local to macro-regional) to identify the factors that shape regional (?) and macro-regional (?) deep-sea diversity. This study was conducted in several deep-sea habitats (canyons, open slopes, deep-water corals, and bathyal plains) over > 2000 km across the whole Mediterranean Basin, at a bathymetric range comprised between ca. 600 and 1300 m. Our results indicate that the patterns of local (?) diversity across the deep Mediterranean follow the gradients of the trophic conditions, which decrease from the western to the eastern basins. For all of the sites and habitats, the ? diversity is generally low. Conversely, the turnover diversity changes significantly among habitats (? diversity) and between regions (? diversity), showing values of dissimilarity (based on species presence/absence matrixes) between 59 and 90% for ? diversity and between 81 and 89% for ? diversity. This suggests that patterns and values of ? and ? diversities in the deep Mediterranean Sea are related to turnover diversity among habitats and between regions (? and ? diversities), rather than to the local biodiversity (? diversity). These results indicate also that the differences in ? and ? diversities are even more important than those in ? diversity for the comprehension of the drivers of biodiversity in the deep Mediterranean Sea. We conclude that the presence of different habitats and gradients in environmental conditions, by promoting a high turnover diversity across the Mediterranean Sea, may play a crucial role in the levels of ? diversity of deep-sea nematodes."

Substantial research efforts are often required to estimate vital rates, with results of unknown applicability to other locations or larger areas within the species range. We investigated whether a rate variable, growth, can be estimated across the entire range of a species. We used data from the commercial range of the American lobster <i>Homarus americanus</i> to develop a model to calculate von Bertalanffy growth parameters at any location in that range. Fixing the maximum size parameter (<i>L</i><sub>?</sub>) to a biologically reasonable value resulted in more realistic estimates of growth than estimating this parameter from data at any one location. The growth parameter <i>k</i> decreased with latitude at a rate of 0.51% per year per degree of latitude for males and 0.40% for females. The von Bertalanffy parameters apply to individual growth; the bias in using these parameters to estimate population growth was minor. The underlying mechanism for the latitude model was investigated by GIS mapping of candidate environmental factors: depth, temperature, and salinity. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the growth parameter <i>k</i> and temperature. Growth rates of American lobster can now be estimated on a site-specific basis without having to undertake resource-intensive tag-recapture field studies or adopting an estimate from a distant location.

This paper examines how undiscovered Arctic oil and gas resources are distributed within the territories of the eight Arctic nations and within the territories claimed by these nations. Knowing how resources are distributed will help determine whether it is worth having disputes over the claimed territories as well as determining the importance of the U.S. ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

This paper utilized geo-processing and areal estimation from United States Geological Survey (USGS), Arctic resource data, and territorial border data for probing the above issues. The analysis suggests that most of the resources are distributed within existing rather than claimed territories. The key conclusions are: (1) extended continental shelf claims should not be a major point of contention; (2) the U.S. and Russia are overwhelmingly the largest holders of undiscovered Arctic oil and gas; (3) the U.S. has little reason to ratify the UNCLOS for the purpose of securing energy resources; and (4) Greenland may be unexpectedly important in future Arctic discussions. These findings alter the geopolitics of undiscovered Arctic resources and shift the importance onto energy resources within existing territories."	"Wong, E."	\N

Marcus, 1964 and <i>Haminoea japonica </i>Pilsbry, 1895are here considered as established on the basis of published and unpublished data, and recent records of the latter considerably expand its known Mediterranean range to the Tyrrhenian Sea. COI sequences obtained indicate that a comprehensive survey of additional European localities is needed to elucidate the dispersal pathways of <i>Haminoea japonica</i>. Recent records and interpretation of several molluscan taxa as alien are discussed both in light of new Mediterranean (published and unpublished) records and of four categories previously excluded from alien species lists. Within this framework, ten taxa are no longer considered as alien species, or their records from Italy are refuted. Furthermore, <i>Trochocochlea castriotae</i> Bellini, 1903 is considered a new synonym for <i>Gibbula albida </i>(Gmelin, 1791). Data provided here leave unchanged as 35 the number of alien molluscan taxa recorded from Italy as well as the percentage of the most plausible vectors of introduction, but raise to 22 the number of established species along the Italian shores during the 2005–2010 period, and backdate to 1792 the first introduction of an alien molluscan species (<i>Littorina saxatilis</i>) to the Italian shores."

287754	2013	AS	Bivalvia - A discussion of known unknowns	"Bivalves share many of the “deeper” questions with the other molluscan groups - issues such as their origin and sister-group relationships within the Mollusca, and their suitability to explore molecular data in a “known” fossil framework. Other questions are more specific to bivalves, a group that radiated so successfully and nowadays predominantly specializes as infaunal and sessile epifaunal suspension feeders. This paper highlights and explores unanswered questions, from the seemingly trivial and mundane (<i>e.g</i>., how many species are actually out there?), to exploring enigmatic clades about which we know extremely little besides their shells, to macroevolutionary questions that could best be addressed by bivalve-based data. Fast-developing molecular approaches, including the first genome-level and transcriptomic data, a resurgence of detailed morphological and soft-anatomical research, and a renewed focus on Bivalvia by biological and paleontological workers provide us with an opportunity to address such issues. Coordination of efforts - and reciprocal illumination - across traditional disciplinary boundaries will be key factors in such endeavors."	"Bieler, R.; Mikkelsen, P.M.; Giribet, G."

Increase in knowledge of the marine biota of the Hauraki Gulf region (and beyond) in the 1960s–2010s was achieved through targeted taxonomic studies and indirectly in the course of other research and fieldwork by staff, students and visitors. The Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve is the type locality for 46 species and the area including Leigh harbour, Matheson Bay and Whangateau Harbour includes the type localities for 21 additional species. Altogether, University of Auckland staff and their students, throughout their professional careers, have described 570 new species of New Zealand marine life, c. 3.2% of the known marine biota of the exclusive economic zone. The laboratory has had an immeasurable influence as a training ground for field work and experimentation and from decades of oral instruction, published books, monographs and papers, and the examples and inspiration of the key personalities.

Playing crucial roles in diverse ecosystems, they occur since the Eocene to present and are widely used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. However, the lack of a clear taxonomic consensus led to a vast confusion concerning the relation of Elphidiidae with other rotaliids, in particular Nonionidae (<i>Haynesina</i>) and Rotaliidae (<i>Ammonia</i>). Moreover, high morphological plasticity of the test prevented the establishment of a clear definition for many species and genera of this family. Here, 66 new sequences of the SSU rRNA gene were obtained and used to build an extensive dataset including 94 complete or partial sequences of the SSU rDNA of 17 different morphospecies of Elphidiidae, <i>Haynesina</i> and <i>Ammonia</i>. Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset allowed identifying six strongly supported clades. Comparison of these molecular clades with the morphological characters of the analyzed individuals showed major discrepancies with the current taxonomic system. The relations between the six clades depended on the selection of the outgroup to the Elphidiidae. For biological and morphological reasons, we privileged here the choice of Ammonia, prompting the inclusion of <i>Haynesina</i> to the family Elphidiidae. However, this does not necessarily imply a monophyletic origin of all these taxa. In fact, we cannot exclude that Elphidiidae as they are defined here are paraphyletic and that <i>Ammonia</i> as well as some other rotaliids are branching within them."

Altogether, 333 taxa were identified with 14 being ubiquitous, as they were found in the cool temperate, warm temperate, and subtropical areas, as well as in St. Lucia Estuary situated close to Moçambique. There was little difference between the epipelic diatom species present in intertidal and subtidal areas and, because many of the species have a high tolerance to salinity, with some being found in conditions ranging from freshwater to a salinity of more than 150 psu, it was concluded that many of the species sampled do not appear to be reliable indicators for assessing salinity in South African estuaries. Although there was a wide spread of diatoms across all of the estuaries around the coast, the greatest species similarity occurred between the Olifants, Great Berg and Breede estuaries, suggesting that the Breede Estuary, normally considered to fall within the warm temperate region, may be more similar to the cool temperate type estuaries.

The species was first observed in North America near Delaware Bay (39°N, 75°W) in 1988, and a variety of evidence suggests initial introduction via ballast water early in that decade. The crab spread rapidly after its discovery, and breeding populations currently extend from North Carolina to Maine (35°–45°N). <i>H. sanguineus</i> is now the dominant crab in rocky intertidal habitat along much of the northeast coast of the USA and has displaced resident crab species throughout this region. The Asian shore crab also occurs on the Atlantic coast of Europe and was first reported from Le Havre, France (49°N, 0°E) in 1999. Invasive populations now extend along 1000 km of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula in France to Lower Saxony in Germany (48°–53°N). Success of the Asian shore crab in alien habitats has been ascribed to factors such as high fecundity, superior competition for space and food, release from parasitism, and direct predation on co-occurring crab species. Laboratory and field observations indicate that <i>H. sanguineus</i> is a generalist predator with potential for substantial effects on sympatric populations of mollusks and crustaceans. However, broad ecosystem effects and actual economic impact are unclear. The literature on <i>H. sanguineus</i> is limited in comparison to better known invasive species like the European green crab (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>) and the Chinese mitten crab (<i>Eriocheir sinensis</i>). Nevertheless, there are substantial bodies of work on larval biology, trophic ecology, and interspecies competition. This paper presents a review of the biology and ecology of invasive populations of the Asian shore crab <i>H. sanguineus</i> in North American and European habitats."	"Epifanio, C.E."

Here we analyze its patterns of species richness, origination, and extinction over the past 12 My in the southwestern caribbean (SWC). Taxic analysis of a database comprising 3344 specimens and 114 species shows species richness and sampling intensity to co-vary over this interval. Richness is lowest in the late miocene (pre-NN11), then rises and remains approximately constant until the recent, when it rises sharply. No large peaks in fossil origination rates occur, though extinction rates may increase between 2 and 1 ma. Well-sampled extinct species had median durations of 0.8–1.75 My, but the large majority of species are rare, confined to one or a few horizons, and have durations of <1 My.  <i>Polystira</i> shows the highest species origination rates recorded among marine gastropods (0.585–0.935 My<sup>-1</sup>), combined with short species durations; 94% of living species evolved within the past 1.6 My. This contrasts with longer durations and slower speciation rates in the hyperdiverse conoidean Conus, but that pattern requires restudy. High post-isthmian diversity—coinciding with increased habitat heterogeneity—contrasts with the massive decline in SWC species richness in another carnivorous gastropod—the “strombinid” columbellidae. We suggest that diversification of <i>Polystira</i> has been driven by intrinsic feeding-related specialization, whereas regionally the near-extinction of scavenging, non-specialized “strombinids” is a direct response to an extrinsic decline in seasonality and variation in food supply that supports trophic generalism."

The highest and most consistent rates of nitrate release were among the Thorectidae (0.324 to 0.725 µmol g dry wt<sup>?1</sup> h<sup>?1</sup>), while mycalid and verongid sponges were highly variable (0.024 to 0.743 µmol g dry wt<sup>?1</sup> h<sup>?1</sup>). The ratio of nitrate to ammonium in released nitrogen ranged from 0.1 to 197.0, indicating a wide range of nitrogen release modes by sponges, from predominantly ammonium to very efficient nitrate producers. The study more than doubles the number of temperate sponge species recorded to release nitrate. Nutrient concentrations near the seabed sponge assemblages were higher at low wind speed (a proxy for turbulent mixing). These observations and our measurements of nitrogen release rates from sponges are consistent with the hypothesis that primary production in the region depends on wave-induced mixing at the seabed for resupply of remineralized nitrogen to a nutrient-impoverished water column and that sponges make an important contribution to these fluxes. Based on known biomass of sponges in southwestern Australia, we calculate that sponges may contribute DIN of 1.8 to 3.2 g N m<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>?1</sup>. Taking into account the distribution of sponge habitat across the continental shelf to 100 m depth, this constitutes a contribution of 10% to 18% of the total recycled nitrogen flux required from the benthos to balance a regional nitrogen budget."

The sediment quality was defined by measuring the level of organic enrichment (quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter) and oxygen stress (redox potential).

Nematode biomass spectra (NBS) proved to be extremely valuable in determining differences in the environmental quality of sediments on a hundred-metre spatial scale. High peaks of the NBS were observed in the more organic-rich and oxygen-stressed stations probably in relation to a lower diversity of the nematode communities in these stations, with the predominance of tolerant genera such as Paracomesoma and Sabatieria. Among allometric variables, the length was found to be negatively correlated with oxygen concentrations and positively with TOM percentages, whilst the morphotype length/width ratio (L/W) resulted negatively related to oxygen concentrations and organic matter quality (protein:carbohydrate ratio), suggesting that these allometric attributes represent indicators of the functional adaptation of nematodes to the changing environmental conditions.

In estuaries we must account not only for a great natural variability along the estuarine gradient (e.g. sediment type and dynamics, oxygen availability, temperature and flow speed) but also for the existence of anthropogenic pressures (e.g. high local population density, presence of harbors and dredging activities).
Spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of meiofauna and free-living marine nematodes were studied in the Mondego estuary (Portugal). Both taxonomic and functional approaches were applied to nematode communities in order to describe the community structure and to relate it with the environmental parameters along the estuary. At all sampling events, nematode assemblages reflected the estuarine gradient, and salinity and grain size composition were confirmed to be the main abiotic factors controlling the distribution of the assemblages.
Moreover, the low temporal variability may indicate that natural variability is superimposed by the anthropogenic pressures present in some areas of the estuary.

Diatoms have some life phases that can be observed in its batch culture The purpose of this research is to study the population growth of the diatom <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> populations in the <i>f/2</i> medium and Conway medium of the growth curve is formed. This study also aims to determine the generation time and instantaneous growth rate of this the diatom species in both medium, in order to know which one is more appropriate medium for <i>Skeletonema costatum.</i> 
The batch culture of <i>S. costatum</i> was applied at <i>f/2</i> medium and Conway medium with three replications for 7x24 hours in a sterile condition. Environmental parameters (pH, salinity, and temperature of the medium) were measured periodically. The population growth of the culture reached the lag phase in the first 24 hours, the exponential phase in the second 24 hours, whereas the stationary phase was in the third 24 hours. The growth of <i>S. costatum</i> in both medium were not significantly different. <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> growth rate in <i>f/2</i> medium were 0.0282 cells/hour and its generation time were 25.5420 hours. On the other hand, <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> growth rate in Conway medium were 0.0228 cells/hour and its generation time were 30.3728 hours. This study proved that the growth of <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> populations in <i>f/2</i> medium and Conway medium tends to be similar (Sig. 0.325, ? = .10)."	"Armanda, D.T."	\N
