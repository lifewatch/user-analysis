238933	2014	AS	First glimpse into Lower Jurassic deep-sea biodiversity: <i>in situ</i> diversification and resilience against extinction	"Owing to the assumed lack of deep-sea macrofossils older than the Late Cretaceous, very little is known about the geological history of deep-sea communities, and most inference-based hypotheses argue for repeated recolonizations of the deep sea from shelf habitats following major palaeoceanographic perturbations. We present a fossil deep-sea assemblage of echinoderms, gastropods, brachiopods and ostracods, from the Early Jurassic of the Glasenbach Gorge, Austria, which includes the oldest known representatives of a number of extant deep-sea groups, and thus implies that in situ diversification, in contrast to immigration from shelf habitats, played a much greater role in shaping modern deep-sea biodiversity than previously thought. A comparison with coeval shelf assemblages reveals that, at least in some of the analysed groups, significantly more extant families/superfamilies have endured in the deep sea since the Early Jurassic than in the shelf seas, which suggests that deep-sea biota are more resilient against extinction than shallow-water ones. In addition, a number of extant deep-sea families/superfamilies found in the Glasenbach assemblage lack post-Jurassic shelf occurrences, implying that if there was a complete extinction of the deep-sea fauna followed by replacement from the shelf, it must have happened before the Late Jurassic.

241377	2014	AS	Check-list of Cnidaria and Ctenophora from the coasts of Turkey	"This paper presents the actual status of species diversity of the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora along the Turkish coasts of the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara, the Aegean Sea, and the Levantine Sea. A total of 195 cnidarian species belonging to 5 classes (Hydrozoa, Cubozoa, Scyphozoa, Staurozoa, and Anthozoa) have been determined in these regions. Eight anthozoan species (Arachnanthus oligopodus, Bunodactis rubripunctata, Bunodeopsis strumosa, Corynactis viridis, Halcampoides purpureus, Sagartiogeton lacerates, Sagartiogeton undatus, and Pachycerianthus multiplicatus) are reported for the first time as elements of the Turkish marine fauna in the present study. The highest number of cnidarian species (121 species) was reported from the Aegean Sea, while the lowest (17 species) was reported from the Black Sea. The hot spot areas for cnidarian diversity are the Prince Islands, Istanbul Strait, Izmir Bay, and Datça Peninsula, where relatively intensive scientific efforts have been carried out. Regarding ctenophores, 7 species are distributed along the Turkish coasts, 5 of which were reported from the Black Sea. A total of 16 alien cnidarian and 2 ctenophore species were determined in the regions. Two species (Sagartiogeton laceratus and Pachycerianthus multiplicatus) are new alien species for the Mediterranean Sea and could have been introduced to the northern part of the Sea of Marmara and Iskenderun Bay, areas from which these species are recorded, by ships from the North-East Atlantic.

However, a unique georeferenced standard of marine place names and boundaries was yet to be established. As such, an online, open-access, standardised, hierarchical list of geographic names – Marine Regions – was developed, linking each of these names to information and maps of the geographic location. The objectives are to capture all geographic marine names worldwide, including ocean basins, seas, seamounts, sandbanks, ridges, bays and other marine geographical place names and attributes, and to display univocally the boundaries of marine biogeographic or other managed marine areas in order to facilitate marine data management, marine (geographic) research and the management of marine areas.

240567	2014	AS	Biodiversity data requirements for systematic conservation planning in the Mediterranean Sea	"The Mediterranean Sea’s biodiversity and ecosystems face many threats due to anthropogenic pressures. Some of these include human population growth, coastal urbanization, accelerated human activities, and climate change. To enhance the formation of a science-based system of marine protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea, data on the spatial distribution of ecological features (abiotic variables, species, communities, habitats, and ecosystems) is required to inform conservation scientists and planners. However, the spatial data required is often lacking. In this review, we aimed to address the status of our knowledge for 3 major types of spatial information: bathymetry, classification of marine habitats, and species distributions. To exemplify the data gaps and approaches to bridge them, we examined case studies that systematically prioritize conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that at present the data required for conservation planning is generally more readily available and of better quality for the European countries located in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the Mediterranean Sea is lagging behind other marine regions where rigorous criteria for conservation planning has been applied in the past 20 yr. Therefore, we call upon scientists, governments, and international governmental and non-governmental organizations to harmonize current approaches in marine mapping and to develop a framework that is applicable throughout the Mediterranean region. Such coordination between stakeholders is urgently needed before more countries undertake further extensive habitat mapping, so that future conservation planning can use integrated spatial datasets."

241001	2014	AS	Fifty years on: Lessons from marine reserves in New Zealand and principles for a worldwide network	"New Zealand pioneered marine reserves, areas in the sea protected from all direct human interference. The first reserve was proposed in 1965 and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even one instance proves that such things are possible.

All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be expected.

Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs), cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long Bay).

Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both scientific theory and practical politics.

When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change, due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades. The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing directly and indirectly alters ecosystems.

The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to fishing and other human activities.

The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest.

The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining.

Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in Australia and the USA.

230520	2014	AS	Strategies for the sustainability of online open-access biodiversity databases	"Scientists can ensure that high quality research information is readily available on the Internet so society is not dependant on less authoritative sources. Many scientific projects and initiatives published information on species and biodiversity on the World Wide Web without users needing to pay for it. However, these resources often stagnated when project funding expired. Based on a large pool of experiences worldwide, this article discusses what measures will help such data resources develop beyond the project lifetime.Biodiversity data, just as data in many other disciplines, are often not generated automatically by machines or sensors. Data on for example species are based on human observations and interpretation. This requires continuous data curation to keep these up to date. Creators of online biodiversity databases should consider whether they have the resources to make their database of such value that other scientists and/or institutions would continue to finance its existence. To that end, it may be prudent to engage such partners in the development of the resource from an early stage. Managers of existing biodiversity databases should reflect on the factors being important for sustainability. These include the extent, scope, quality and uniqueness of database content; track record of development; support from scientists; support from institutions, and clarity of Intellectual Property Rights. Science funders should give special attention to the development of scholarly databases with expert-validated content. The science community has to become aware of the efforts of scientists in contributing to open-access databases, including by citing these resources in the Reference lists of publications that use them. Science culture must thus adapt its practices to support online databases as scholarly publications.To sustain such databases, we recommend they should (a) become integrated into larger collaborative databases or information systems with a consequently larger user community and pool of funding opportunities, and (b) be owned and curated by a science organisation, society, or institution with a suitable mandate. Good governance and proactive communication with contributors is important to maintain the team enthusiasm that launched the resource. Experience shows that ‘bigger is better’ in terms of database size because the resource will have more content, more potential and known uses and users of its content, more contributors, be more prestigious to contribute to, and have more funding options. Furthermore, most successful biodiversity databases are managed by a partnership of individuals and organisations."

This new species lives on fine and very fine sandy bottoms at the bank flanks, between 1536 and 1809 m depths.

They are focal points for global marine conservation because they occur in regions where human populations are rapidly expanding. Our review of 11 TMSs focuses on three key ecosystems—coral reefs and emergent atolls, deep benthic systems, and pelagic biomes—and synthesizes, illustrates, and contrasts knowledge of biodiversity, ecosystem function, interaction between adjacent habitats, and anthropogenic pressures. TMSs vary in the extent that they have been subject to human influence—from the nearly pristine Coral Sea to the heavily exploited South China and Caribbean Seas—but we predict that they will all be similarly complex to manage because most span multiple national jurisdictions. We conclude that developing a structured process to identify ecologically and biologically significant areas that uses a set of globally agreed criteria is a tractable first step toward effective multinational and transboundary ecosystem management of TMSs."

To begin with, there is little research that categorizes the typologies of regulatory capture despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon. After a discussion of theoretical approaches to regulatory capture, I describe the operative definition and theory appropriate to the situation related to authorization of oil and natural gas production in Israel following the discovery of large offshore reserves in 2010. This approach, embodying several facets of existing typologies, is applied to decisions made authorizing construction of the Gabriella offshore exploratory drilling platform. The analysis highlights the nature of capture in the absence of clear agency jurisdiction over new activities located in offshore environs organized as temporal and spatial “vacuums”. I conclude that comprehensive marine spatial planning would result in less capture and the development of more capture-resistant regulations."	"Portman, M.E."	WOS:000330813800005
240024	2014	AS	Marine biological valuation of the shallow Belgian coastal zone: A space-use conflict example within the context of marine spatial planning	"The Belgian coastal zone hosts a complex of space- and resource-use activities with a myriad of pressures. Specifically at the beaches, predictions on sea-level rise, storms and flood risk from the North Sea have led to several big coastal defence projects. Management of sandy beaches is therefore a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined and where biodiversity should be taken into account.In this study, the biological value of the shallow Belgian coastal zone was derived based on a detailed and integrated dataset (1995–2011) of all available ecological information on macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos and birds. The 67 km Belgian coastline was divided into an across-shore intertidal and shallow subtidal subzone, and into along-shore subzones of 250 m for benthic components and 3 km for birds. The intrinsic biological value of each subzone was then calculated using the biological valuation method, and the pertained score, ranging from very low to very high, was plotted accordingly in order to obtain a marine biological valuation map.Following trends were detected: (1) a strong mosaic pattern of biological value along the coastline; (2) a clear lack of (benthic) data at the eastern part of the Belgian coast; (3) a rather high biological value in around 70% of the shallow subtidal subzones, compared to the intertidal part; and (4) a high/very high biological value in intertidal zones located immediately to the east of the harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende and Zeebrugge.A detailed analysis of protected areas and areas under coastal flood risk indicated that biological valuation maps are very promising management tools for local decision-makers as they allow for an early integration of ‘natural/ecological values’ in policy implementation."

The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (<em>Pseudotriakis microdon</em>) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection."

232720	2014	AS	Selective feeding by pelagic fish in the Belgian part of the North Sea	"Pelagic fish and their planktonic prey are susceptible to a changing climate, giving rise to mismatches and planktonic bottlenecks. A detailed examination of the feeding ecology of pelagic fish can provide valuable insights in the causes and consequences of these phenomena. The present study investigated the diets of both juvenile and adult herring, sprat, horse mackerel, and adult mackerel in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) in relation to the distribution of zooplankton and ambient abiotic conditions. A study sampling pelagic fish and zooplankton simultaneously every month during consecutive years, and spanning nearshore to offshore sampling locations, is unprecedented in the southern North Sea. In all, 71 prey taxa were found in 725       stomachs of fish gathered at ten stations, sampled monthly in 2009 and 2010. The proportion of fish with empty stomachs was    low (11%), and the number of prey species ranged from 0 to 21 sp. per stomach. The diet of herring and sprat was dominated         by calanoid copepods, but herring stomachs also contained many decapod larvae, amphipods, cumaceans, and mysids. Mackerel       added sandeels to an otherwise planktivorous diet. Horse mackerel consumed both benthic and pelagic prey. The highest frequency     of occurrence in the stomachs was observed for the calanoid copepods <em>Temora longicornis</em> (33 408 of all 55 004 prey items identified) and <em>Centropages hamatus</em> (5003 times found). The fullness index ranged between 0 and 20.6, and averaged highest for sprat (0.86), followed by herring           (0.60), horse mackerel (0.26), and mackerel (0.24). We observed a different composition of zooplankton species and life stages      in the plankton samples compared with those in the fish stomachs. More adult and female copepods were eaten than the plankton       samples would suggest. Also, the calanoid copepod <em>Acartia clausi</em>, the most common calanoid species in the BPNS, was barely eaten, as was the case for fish eggs and larvae, and for common planktonic species known to be preyed upon elsewhere (e.g. <em>Oikopleura dioica</em>, <em>Evadne nordmanni</em>,  em>Euterpina acutifrons</em>). Additionally, plankton densities averaged highest in spring and at midshore (20–30 km from shore) stations, but fullness index was highest nearshore (<12 km from shore) and (apart from sprat) in summer. A significant correlation between fullness index and total density of planktonic prey species was not observed, indicating that zooplankton densities were not restrictive. Yet the fact that more than 100 plankton species occurred in the plankton samples and just two of these (<em>T. longicornis</em> and <em>C. hamatus</em>) accounted for nearly three-quarters of all ingested prey items leads us to conclude that even minor changes in the ecology or phenology of these dominant zooplankters could have profound effects on pelagic fish stocks.

From 2009 until 2012 the behavioural ecology of Atlantic cod and pouting was investigated at WARs in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS). Information on length-frequency distribution, diet, community structure and movements were combined to gain insights on the behavioural ecology and to unravel whether production occurs. We demonstrated that specific age groups of Atlantic cod and pouting are seasonally attracted towards the WARs, that they show high site fidelity and feed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present. Growth was observed throughout the period the fishes were present. Production on a local scale can be assumed. On a regional scale however, no changes were observed yet.

More than 1,900 MPAs covering 200,881 km<sup>2</sup> (1.6% of the exclusive economic zone for the region) have been established within these countries over the last 40 years under legal mandates that range from village level traditional law to national legal frameworks that mandate the protection of large areas as MPAs. The focus of protection has been primarily on critical marine habitats and ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on maintaining and improving the status of near-shore fisheries, a primary food and economic resource in the region. This article brings together for the first time a consistent set of current data on MPAs for the six countries and reviews progress toward the establishment of MPAs in these countries with regard to (i) coverage of critical habitat (e.g., 17.8% of the coral reef habitat within the region lies within an MPA), (ii) areas under effective management, and (iii) actions needed to improve the implementation of MPAs as a marine conservation and resource management strategy. The contribution of MPAs to the Coral Triangle MPA System as called for in the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security Regional Plan of Action is clarified. Options for scaling up existing MPAs to networks of MPAs that are more ecologically linked and integrated with fisheries management and responsive to changing climate through the Coral Triangle MPA System development are discussed. A key point is the need to improve the effectiveness of existing MPAs, and plan in a manner leading to ecosystem-based management."

In contrast to a few characterized cases of bacterial and protistan parasites, the existence and biological significance of deep-sea parasitic fungi is yet to be understood. Here we report the discovery of a fungus-related parasitic microsporidium, <i>Nematocenator marisprofundi</i> n. gen. n. sp. that infects benthic nematodes at methane seeps on the Pacific Ocean floor. This infection is species-specific and has been temporally and spatially stable over 2 years of sampling, indicating an ecologically consistent host-parasite interaction. A high distribution of spores in the reproductive tracts of infected males and females and their absence from host nematodes' intestines suggests a sexual transmission strategy in contrast to the fecal-oral transmission of most microsporidia. <i>N. marisprofundi</i> targets the host's body wall muscles causing cell lysis, and in severe infection even muscle filament degradation. Phylogenetic analyses placed <i>N. marisprofundi</i> in a novel and basal clade not closely related to any described microsporidia clade, suggesting either that microsporidia-nematode parasitism occurred early in microsporidia evolution or that host specialization occurred late in an ancient deep-sea microsporidian lineage. Our findings reveal that methane seeps support complex ecosystems involving interkingdom interactions between bacteria, nematodes, and parasitic fungi and that microsporidia parasitism exists also in the deep-sea biosphere."

One-third of the species have not been reported from the neighbouring, well-explored Alboran Island platform. There is a considerable balance between the trophic groups, denoting a stable and structured community. Most of the species have an extensive Atlantic range, and most have a planktonic larval stage. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the fauna benefits from a diverse influx of larvae carried in by the more superficial incoming Atlantic current.

These are crucial in environmental and agricultural challenges, e.g., they are a basic element in the generation of species distribution models. Unfortunately, their exploitation is still difficult and time consuming for many scientists. No database currently exists that can claim to host, and make available in a seamless way, all the species occurrence data needed by the ecology scientific community. Occurrence data are scattered among several databases and information systems. It is not easy to retrieve records from them, because of differences in the adopted protocols, formats and granularity. Once collected, datasets have to be selected, homogenised and pre-processed before being ready-to-use in scientific analysis and modelling.

But invasive species risk assessments are time consuming, data intensive and expensive. Consequently, resource poor nations cannot implement these schemes. Here we develop a method for creating watch lists using the consistent predictors of invasion success—history of invasion, environmental suitability, and propagule pressure (measured respectively using the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), environmental modelling, and tourism and trade data). We tested the approach for South Africa, at a national level for various taxa and at a provincial level for plants. Of 884 alien species listed in the GISD, 400 were potential invaders, with most occurring in high risk regions. When alien species in South Africa were evaluated there were many false-negatives (sensitivity of 32% for terrestrial and 40% for marine species), because the GISD is not comprehensive, but few false positives (specificity of 91% for terrestrial and 89% for marine species). The methodology was easy to apply at different political levels, but we found substantial overlaps between the national and provincial watch lists of plants. This simple technique is rapid, easily repeatable, flexible, transparent, works across taxa, and does not require substantial financial or scientific input. It can be used in any region of the world and at various political levels as an initial assessment of key threats. As such it may be an important step in developing biosecurity schemes for resource poor regions."	"Faulkner, K.T.; Robertson, M.P.; Rouget, M.; Wilson, J.R.U."	WOS:000345475500004

We performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis of marine nematodes to: i) disentangle relationships among tropical desmodorid species; and ii) compare the performance of the nuclear SSU rDNA and mitochondrial COI nucleotide sequences in 42 and 45 nominal species, respectively, to identify species. We generated 27 new sequences of SSU rDNA belonging to five genera not previously sequenced, and 34 new sequences of COI belonging to six genera and four families not previously sequenced. The SSU rDNA tree confirmed the Enoplida to be a monophyletic sister group to the Chromadorida. The family Comesomatidae is a sister group of the Xyalidae within the Monhysterida. Both DNA markers confirmed the congruence between the morphology- and molecular-based phylogenetic inferences for most of the families. Desmodoridae was a monophyletic group, but the relationships within the family could not be recovered; the subfamilies Desmodorinae and Spiriniinae were not monophyletic meanwhile the monophyly of Stilbonematinae was not fully supported due to a few specimens of questionable identity. COI performed better than SSU rDNA to disentangle relationships among closely related species and suggested the presence of cryptic diversity within Desmodoridae. COI is effective to explore cryptic diversity and barcode species within Nematoda, with a possible threshold of genetic distance of 5% between conspecific and interspecific sequences, but DNA barcoding is limited by the poor knowledge of the diversity and taxonomy of the group and the lack of a good reference database of vouchered COI sequences."

247323	2014	AS	3D-microanatomy of the straight-shelled pteropod <i>Creseis clava</i> (Gastropoda: Heterobranchia: Euthecosomata)	"The Thecosomata are pelagic euopisthobranch pteropods that are important for marine food chains, but threatened by ocean acidification. Members of the suborder Euthecosomata are either torted snails with a coiled, sinistral shell (Limacinidae) or are straight-shelled with a symmetrical body and an unusual ventral mantle cavity (Orthoconcha). The classification and taxonomy of euthecosomes still depends on shells, but is being challenged by initial molecular data. There is a large body of morphoanatomical information dating from the beginning of the last century, and only biological (rather than soft-part anatomical) detail has been added since. For our initial study on pteropod morphoanatomy we have selected the potentially basal orthoconch genus Creseis Rang, 1828. Supplementing Meisenheimer's (1905) monographic work, we redescribe the microanatomy of the Mediterranean C. clava (Rang, 1828) from serial semithin sections and present 3D-models of all major organ systems. In the absence of histological differences we interpret the head to be fused with the foot, forming the wings with reduced labial tentacles and rhinophores. The postpharyngeal nerve ring is strongly condensed, showing fused buccal ganglia and a short visceral loop with two discernable ganglia. The genital system is monaulic and hermaphroditic, with female glands and a potential allosperm receptacle of unclear homology. An open seminal groove connects with the frontal copulatory organ, which shows complex penial infoldings. We confirm the 180° longitudinal rotation of the visceral organs relative to the condition in limacinids. As an alternative to ontogenetic detorsion, progenesis may have skipped torsion. Other obvious paedomorphoses such as single, basally forked tentacular nerves, suggest that heterochrony has been a driving force in thecosome evolution. Retaining the mantle cavity in a ventral position, Creseis has its large mantle gland—necessary for creating a mucus web for feeding—close to the mouth. Further comparative microanatomical data on orthoconchs and limacinids are needed to corroborate our assumptions of homology, and for reconstructing pteropod evolution once reliable molecular phylogenetic hypotheses are available.

We set out to gain insights into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (<em>Coryphaena hippurus</em>; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16,610 sharks were observed caught, with 11,166 identified to species level. Of these, 70.6% were blue sharks (<em>Prionace glauca)</em>, 28.4% short-fin mako sharks (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>), and 1% were other species (including thresher (<em>Alopias vulpinus</em>), hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna zygaena</em>), porbeagle (<em>Lamnus nasus</em>), and other Carcharhinidae species (<em>Carcharhinus brachyurus</em>,<em> Carcharhinus falciformis</em>,<em> Galeorhinus galeus</em>). Mean&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;SD catch per unit effort of 33.6&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;10.9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1.9&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;3.1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83.7% of sharks caught (74.7% blue sharks; 93.3% mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem.

The time series is analysed using Similarities Profiles (SIMPROF) tests and associated methods. Q-mode analysis using clustering with Type 1 SIMPROF addresses multivariate structure among samples, showing that there is clear structure associated with differences among years. Inverse (r-mode) analysis using Type 2 SIMPROF decisively rejects a hypothesis that species are not associated with each other. Clustering of the variables (species) with Type 3 SIMPROF identifies groups of species which covary coherently through the time-series. The time-series is characterised by a dramatic decline in abundances and diversity between the 1993 and 1996 surveys. By 1998 there had been a shift in community composition from the 1993 situation, with different species dominating. Communities had recovered in terms of abundance and species richness, but different species dominated the community. No single factor could be identified which unequivocally explained the dramatic changes observed in the SMNR. Possible causes were the effects of dispersed oil and dispersants from the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996 and the cessation of dredge-spoil disposal off St Annes Head in 1995, but the most likely cause was severe weather. With many species, and a demonstrable recovery from an impact, communities within the SMNR appear to be diverse and resilient.

To understand the importance of discards for local L. argentatus and <i>L. fuscus</i> populations, single-item discard experiments were performed at four offshore distances from the gullery of the Port of Zeebrugge, at four different stages of the breeding season (May to August 2011). We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11-year (2002–2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick rearing stage. A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flatfish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consumption between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer. Nutrient requirements of breeding adults peak during the chick rearing stage, making this a key period in terms of dependence of the breeding parents on discarded fish as food source."

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARs."

Using new and already published data, the meiofauna standing stocks (abundance and biomass) and nematode structural and functional diversity were investigated in relation to the sediment biogeochemistry (e.g. organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments) and grain size. A conspicuous increase in sand content from 2005 to 2006 and decrease of phytodetritus at both sites, suggested the occurrence of one or more physical disturbance events. Nematode standing stocks and trophic diversity decreased after these events, seemingly followed by a recovery/recolonisation period in 2007, which was strongly correlated with an increase in the quantity and bioavailability of phytodetrital organic matter supplied. Changes in meiofauna assemblages, however, also differed between stations, likely because of the contrasting hydrodynamic and food supply conditions. Higher meiofauna and nematode abundances, biomass and trophic complexity were found at the shallowest canyon station, where the quantity, quality and bioavailability of food material were higher than at the deeper site. The present results suggest that even though inter-annual variations in the sedimentary environment can regulate the meiofauna in the abyssal Nazare Canyon, heterogeneity between sampling locations in the canyon were more pronounced."

239219	2014	AS	Taxonomy of Stilbonematinae (Nematoda: Desmodoridae): description of two new and three known species and phylogenetic relationships within the family	"A taxonomic study of the subfamily Stilbonematinae (Nematoda: Desmodoridae) based on collected specimens from a coral reef in the Caribbean Sea revealed two new species, <i><b>L</b></i><b><i>axus parvum</i> sp. nov</b>. and <b><i>Leptonemella brevipharynx</i> sp. nov. <i>L. parvum</i></b> is characterized by the small body size (2738?µm), large cephalated spicules (63?µm), wide gubernaculum, and coccoid-shaped ectosymbiotic bacteria. The diagnosis of the genus <i>Laxus</i> is emended and a dichotomous identification key is given for the seven valid species. <i><b>L</b></i><b><i>. brevipharynx</i></b> is characterized by the shape of the amphidial fovea, ‘open’ spiral with 1.25 turns, a short pharynx, hook-shaped gubernaculum, and male tail relatively short. Three known sympatric species, <i>Eubostrichus hopperi</i>, <i>Robbea porosum</i>, and <i>Stilbonema brevicolle</i>, were re-described and illustrated based on morphometric features and morphology from light microscope and scanning electronic microscope observations. For each species, relationships are discussed as well as the diagnostic value of morphological features. Phylogenetic relationships amongst desmodorid species were explored based on <i>small subunit</i> rDNA and <i>cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1</i> partial loci. The three subfamilies within Desmodoridae (Desmodorinae, Spiriniinae, and Stilbonematinae) are polyphyletic; four of the genera of Stilbonematinae proved to be paraphyletic. Convergent evolution would reconcile the presence of glandular sensory organs and ectosymbiosis with the paraphyly of stilbonematins. The cryptic diversity of <i>R.?porosum</i> could be explained by morphological stasis owing to obligate ectosymbiosis with bacteria. The current classification of nine genera is still the most tractable system for Stilbonematinae in spite of the evidence of its paraphyletic nature based on molecular data."

241812	2014	M	Soft-bottom intertidal ecosystems shaped by ecosystem engineers: Consequences for trophic structure	"Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly alter the availability of resources to themselves and to other organisms by modifying the abiotic environment. By doing so, they affect their own distribution and that of other species, which can influence community composition. Moreover, by affecting the abiotic environment and species distribution, ecosystem engineers can also affect the number and strength of biotic interactions among species, such as predation and competition. Together with the notion that engineering effects often persist on long time and large spatial scales, this leads to the suggestion that ecosystem engineers have the potential to alter the structure and dynamics of ecological interaction networks in space and time. In soft-bottom intertidal ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’ Arguin, the group of ecosystem engineers that provide structure such as reef-building bivalves and seagrasses, can have a significant impact on the associated community, since natural ‘hard’ substrate and structure are almost exclusively provided by these species in the otherwise sandy environment. Unfortunately, soft-bottom coastal ecosystems have become severely degraded worldwide during the last centuries due to human impacts and most ecosystem engineers in these systems have strongly declined, with potentially dramatic implications for associated species, community structure and overall biodiversity. The main objective of this thesis is to empirically investigate how and to what extent ecosystem engineers affect the (trophic) structure and dynamics of intertidal soft-bottom communities. Hence, this thesis provides a better understanding of the role of ecosystem engineers in assembling and structuring ecological interaction networks and their importance for effective conservation management of coastal ecosystems. In chapter 2 and 3, we demonstrate that ecosystem engineering effects of reefbuilding bivalves are spatially extended and act on multiple trophic levels. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, transects across three mussel reefs and three nearby sandy areas without reefs showed a peak in cockle densities at ~100 meters coastward from the mussel reef, while cockle abundances within the reefs and in the nearby sandy areas were very low. Additionally, transplantation of tagged cockles showed higher survival of cockles and higher juvenile cockle densities in the area close to the mussel reef compared to areas without mussels, whereas cockle growth was lower close to the reef. This spatial pattern was caused by scale-dependent effects of mussel reefs: in the mussel-reef, cockle survival was reduced by deteriorated sediment conditions through biodeposition and by algal depletion, while further away from the mussel reefs, cockle survival was facilitated due to the reduction of water flow velocity. Next, we demonstrate with a field survey that a comparable spatial pattern is visible in other benthic species and that these effects on their spatial distribution cascade through multiple trophic levels. Distance from the reef,  sediment properties and benthic food abundance simultaneously explained significant parts of the distribution of Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus), Eurasian Curlews (Numenius arquata) and Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica), with higher densities of these shorebirds in the surrounding area of the reef compared to sandy un-engineered tidal flats. Results from these two chapters were then used to develop an experiment to investigate the interactive role of ecosystem engineering, predation and competition in structuring an intertidal bivalve population in the Wadden Sea (chapter 4). In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m-2) and shorebird predation at a site engineered by a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at a sandy control site. We conclude that cockles are caught in the middle. Ecosystem engineering by mussel beds can enhance cockle densities by reducing hydrodynamic stress and predation across different life stages, but can reduce cockle growth by reducing seawater flow and by affecting inter-specific competition for food. This study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem engineers in structuring intertidal communities and the necessity to integrate multiple interaction types into a single framework. In chapter 5, we empirically tested the hypothesis that recovery of aboveground structure and stable sediments provided by ecosystem engineers facilitates the intertidal benthic community by influencing species composition and trophic structure. In a large-scale experiment at two different sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea (West vs. East), we applied anti-erosion mats and added adult mussels to test for the effects of sediment stabilization and habitat modification, respectively. The antierosion mats mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the infaunal community, while the addition of mussels mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the epifaunal community, irrespective of location. In this chapter, we conclude that structure-providing and sediment-stabilizing species such as mussels play an important role in facilitating the benthic community throughout the Wadden Sea by influencing species composition and trophic structure. On top of this large-scale experiment, the interactive effects of ecosystem engineering and predation on bivalve recruitment were investigated (chapter 6). Results show that both adult mussels and the anti-erosion mat facilitated epibenthic mussel recruits, whereas three other endobenthic bivalve species were facilitated by the mat, but inhibited by mussels. However, these observed facilitation and inhibition effects, only emerged when predators were excluded, demonstrating strong interactive effects between ecosystem engineering and predation. Our findings suggest that loss of ecosystem engineers and disturbance of trophic interactions can strongly hinder bivalve recruitment in coastal ecosystems. Finally, the effects of ecosystem engineering by seagrass and burrowing crabs on food web assembly were studied (chapter 7). Using a unique combination of remote sensing, field surveys, and stable isotopes, we reveal that hierarchical habitat modification by seagrasses and burrowing crabs transform simple intertidal food webs into a complex mosaic of linked inter- and subtidal food webs over long timescales. We found that seagrass and burrowing crabs dramatically alter food web structure, composition and its temporal development by accumulating silt and creating large intertidal pools in the accumulated silt layer, respectively. Our empirical findings show that ecosystem engineering is strongly interwoven with trophic networks by changing food web composition over time. Concluding, results presented in this thesis demonstrate that ecosystem engineering can strongly affect the trophic structure and dynamics of intertidal communities and that ecosystem engineers have a much larger ecological impact on the intertidal community than their actual size and lifespan suggests. Ecosystem engineers in intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems are therefore appealing conservation targets because by managing a single species, entire communities can be positively affected. Nevertheless, findings in this thesis also illustrate that ecosystem engineering are often entangled in a network of multiple interaction types, illustrating that conservation and restoration efforts should focus on multiple species within an integrated network of interaction types. Additionally, due to long-term and large-scale dynamics characterizing ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’Arguin, it is expected that only long-term and large-scale management approaches, such as prolonged closure of large parts to industrial fisheries and mechanical dredging, will be successful in order to restore and protect the unique values of these important intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems."

240515	2014	AS	Contourites and associated sediments controlled by deep-water circulation processes: State-of-the-art and future considerations	"The contourite paradigm was conceived a few decades ago, yet there remains a need to establish a sound connection between contourite deposits, basin evolution and oceanographic processes. Significant recent advances have been enabled by various factors, including the establishment of two IGCP projects and the realisation of several IODP expeditions. Contourites were first described in the Northern and Southern Atlantic Ocean, and since then, have been discovered in every major ocean basin and even in lakes. The 120 major contourite areas presently known are associated to myriad oceanographic processes in surface, intermediate and deep-water masses. The increasing recognition of these deposits is influencing palaeoclimatology & palaeoceanography, slope-stability/geological hazard assessment, and hydrocarbon exploration. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the sedimentological and oceanographic processes governing contourites, which involve dense bottom currents, tides, eddies, deep-sea storms, internal waves and tsunamis. Furthermore, in light of the latest knowledge on oceanographic processes and other governing factors (e.g. sediment supply and sea-level), existing facies models must now be revised. Persistent oceanographic processes significantly affect the seafloor, resulting in large-scale depositional and erosional features. Various classifications have been proposed to subdivide a continuous spectrum of partly overlapping features. Although much progress has been made in the large-scale, geophysically based recognition of these deposits, there remains a lack of unambiguous and commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for deciphering the small-scaled contourite facies and for distinguishing them from turbidite ones. Similarly, the study of sandy deposits generated or affected by bottom currents, which is still in its infancy, offers great research potential: these deposits might prove invaluable as future reservoir targets. Expectations for the forthcoming analysis of data from the IODP Expedition 339 are high, as this work promises to tackle much of the aforementioned lack of knowledge. In the near future, geologists, oceanographers and benthic biologists will have to work in concert to achieve synergy in contourite research to demonstrate the importance of bottom currents in continental margin sedimentation and evolution.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-SA license(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)."

Here we assess previous methods for the design of reserves for climate change and present a new approach to prioritize areas for conservation that leverages the most desirable properties of previous approaches. The new method moves the science of reserve design for climate change a step forwards by: (1) recognizing the role of seasonal acclimation in increasing the limits of environmental tolerance of corals and ameliorating the bleaching response; (2) using the best proxy for acclimatization currently available; (3) including information from several bleaching events, which frequency is likely to increase in the future; (4) assessing relevant variability at country scales, where most management plans are carried out.

Establishing an <i>a priori</i> bottom-up inventory as a tool for top-down modeling is the focus of this work, which extends existing fossil fuel (FF) inventories over the past three decades: (i) It includes ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) emissions, which is a convenient FF tracer gas given available global C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> observations. (ii) Fuel specific CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> emissions uncertainties are quantified. (iii) NG CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> emissions are estimated for different fugitive emissions rate (FER; % of dry production) scenarios as a basis for quantifying global average FER top-down. While our global oil and coal CH<sub>4</sub> estimates coincide well with EDGAR v4.2 for most years, country-level emissions vary substantially, and coal emissions increase at a lower rate over the past decade.

243697	2014	AS	A complete Holocene record of trematode-bivalve infection and implications for the response of parasitism to climate change	"Increasing global temperature and sea-level rise have led to concern about expansions in the distribution and prevalence of complex-lifecycle parasites (CLPs). Indeed, numerous environmental variables can influence the infectivity and reproductive output of many pathogens. Digenean trematodes are CLPs with intermediate invertebrate and definitive vertebrate hosts. Global warming and sea level rise may affect these hosts to varying degrees, and the effect of increasing temperature on parasite prevalence has proven to be nonlinear and difficult to predict. Projecting the response of parasites to anthropogenic climate change is vital for human health, and a longer term perspective (10<sup>4</sup> y) offered by the subfossil record is necessary to complement the experimental and historical approaches of shorter temporal duration (10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> y). We demonstrate, using a high-resolution 9,600-y record of trematode parasite traces in bivalve hosts from the Holocene Pearl River Delta, that prevalence was significantly higher during the earliest stages of sea level rise, significantly lower during the maximum transgression, and statistically indistinguishable in the other stages of sea-level rise and delta progradation. This stratigraphic paleobiological pattern represents the only long-term high-resolution record of pathogen response to global change, is consistent with fossil and recent data from other marine basins, and is instructive regarding the future of disease. We predict an increase in trematode prevalence concurrent with anthropogenic warming and marine transgression, with negative implications for estuarine macrobenthos, marine fisheries, and human health."

244330	2014	AM	The ecology of Box jellyfish (Cubozoa)	"Cubozoa are poorly known compared to their scyphozoan relatives. This has partly been due to a limited knowledge of taxonomy, the rarity of some taxa as well as extreme temporal and spatial variation in abundance of medusae. The latter may reflect the small spatial scales of many populations. Although cubozoan medusae vary greatly in size, they are all excellent swimmers and have strong orientation behaviour. This, combined with resting on the bottom for extended periods of the day in some taxa (e.g. <i>Copula sivickisi</i>), suggests that dispersal may be limited. Despite this, some taxa, such as <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i>, have broad pantropical distributions suggesting a successful phenotype and a long geologic history. Statoliths allow medusae to be aged and provide unique opportunities to obtain accurate estimates of growth and to test ecological hypotheses. The life histories of few taxa have been studied, and until recently only the life cycle of <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i> had been fully described. The ability to rear species is critical for experimentation. Further, knowledge of the ecology of cubozoans is important for understanding population dynamics and predicting risk to swimmers and prey. With the exception of worldwide occurrences, population units have not been determined using well-known tools such as comparative morphology, genetics and elemental chemistry, and this is overdue. New technology is offering exciting ways to study these elusive creatures. This, combined with experimentation, will provide a better understanding of the physical and biological factors influencing the distribution and abundance of cubozoans within and among populations, both now and under climate change.

Molecular phylogenetics recently revealed that they are not members of the externally similar yet phylogenetically derived Pyramidellidae, but instead potentially one of the oldest clades among the heterobranch Gastropoda. Furthermore, current data surprisingly indicate a sister-group relationship with Rhodopemorpha, highly aberrant marine slugs with previously unclear affinities. Murchisonellidae are characterized by a specialized pincer-like radula, but very little further data exist on soft-body anatomy for most species, and there are only a few observations of living animals. Investigation of the anatomy of Murchisonellidae may thus yield new data providing insights into early heterobranch evolution and that of enigmatic Rhodopemorpha. We collected live specimens of the murchisonellid Koloonella cf. minutissima ( Laseron, 1951), a member of a genus known mainly from eastern Australia. We provide detailed live photographs and interactive 3D data on all major organ systems, based on serial histological sections. The mantle cavity is shown to contain several distinct glands, a pair of which is conspicuously similar to glands found in Rhodopemorpha. The anterior digestive system contains a unique four-toothed radula, a feeble pharynx and a special, vacuolated oesophageal bulb. The reproductive system is complex and diaulic, and contains unusual structures. These results highlight structural diversity among minute lower Heterobranchia. Soft-body characters do not contradict, and may even support, the counterintuitive sister-group relationship with shell-less, wormshaped Rhodopemorpha. The classification of Murchisonellidae is discussed and a revised scheme is proposed. "	"Brenzinger, B.; Wilson, N.G.; Schrödl, M."	WOS:000350053600006

Our goal was to identify, from the areas visited by the albatrosses, which coastal states share responsibility in regulating industrial fishing in their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in order to promote the preservation of this species. Using stage-relevant tracking techniques (satellite tags, GPS and GLS loggers), we surveyed 361 at-sea trips by 93 individuals over 9 yr, covering incubation, brooding, chick-rearing, sabbatical, failed-breeding, juvenile and immature stages. Our data show that Amsterdam albatrosses exhibit a wide and variable foraging radius (from 326 ± 193 km during brooding to 5519 ± 766 km for immatures) and at-sea distribution across stages, putting them beyond the French EEZ of Amsterdam Island for all or part of the trips surveyed in each stage, and even outside the Indian Ocean when breeding.

We assess key statistics about species, their distribution, and their status. Most are undescribed. Those we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges. The numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the likely background rate of extinction. Future rates depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity."

Fisheries can impact large predator abundance directly through targeted capture and indirectly through incidental capture of nontarget species or bycatch. However, measures of the global nature of bycatch are lacking for air-breathing megafauna. We fill this knowledge gap and present a synoptic global assessment of the distribution and intensity of bycatch of seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles based on empirical data from the three most commonly used types of fishing gears worldwide. We identify taxa-specific hotspots of bycatch intensity and find evidence of cumulative impacts across fishing fleets and gears. This global map of bycatch illustrates where data are particularly scarce-in coastal and small-scale fisheries and ocean regions that support developed industrial fisheries and millions of small-scale fishers-and identifies fishing areas where, given the evidence of cumulative hotspots across gear and taxa, traditional species or gear-specific bycatch management and mitigation efforts may be necessary but not sufficient. Given the global distribution of bycatch and the mitigation success achieved by some fleets, the reduction of air-breathing megafauna bycatch is both an urgent and achievable conservation priority."

With the advent of alternate survey methods and platforms within the marine environment (e.g. satellite telemetry, passive acoustics, photo identification, nesting site monitoring and genetic sampling) in addition to traditional shipboard or aerial visual surveys, researchers have been developing novel analytical and modeling methodologies to fulfill such in-depth ecological assessments. This trend has raised interests and needs not only in filling spatial, temporal and 'ecological' gaps but also in the synthesis of these disparate data from multiple methods/platforms. OBIS-SEAMAP, a thematic node of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) specializing on marine megavertebrates, takes a unique approach to data integration into the OBIS-SEAMAP database to enable novel applications of a global biogeographic database. In this paper, we summarize our efforts to accomplish this integration and to develop novel mapping and visualization tools available on the OBIS-SEAMAP web site. We also discuss advantages and implications of an integrated database in advancing ecological assessments and modeling efforts based on preliminary assessments of the OBIS-SEAMAP data and derived products.

252970	2014	AS	An integrated approach to the taxonomic identification of prehistoric shell ornaments	"Shell beads appear to have been one of the earliest examples of personal adornments. Marine shells identified far from the shore evidence long-distance transport and imply networks of exchange and negotiation. However, worked beads lose taxonomic clues to identification, and this may be compounded by taphonomic alteration. Consequently, the significance of this key early artefact may be underestimated. We report the use of bulk amino acid composition of the stable intracrystalline proteins preserved in shell biominerals and the application of pattern recognition methods to a large dataset (777 samples) to demonstrate that taxonomic identification can be achieved at genus level. Amino acid analyses are fast (< 2 hours per sample) and micro-destructive (sample size <2 mg). Their integration with non-destructive techniques provides a valuable and affordable tool, which can be used by archaeologists and museum curators to gain insight into early exploitation of natural resources by humans. Here we combine amino acid analyses, macro-and microstructural observations (by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and Raman spectroscopy to try to identify the raw material used for beads discovered at the Early Bronze Age site of Great Cornard (UK).

Within the framework of the BIOFUN project (‘‘Biodiversity andEcosystem Functioning in Contrasting Southern European Deep-sea Environments: from viruses to megafauna’’), weinvestigated the large spatial scale variability (over .1,000 km) of the bathyal macrofauna communities that inhabit theMediterranean basin, and their relationships with the environmental variables. The macrofauna abundance, biomass,community structure and functional diversity were analysed and the a-diversity and b-diversity were estimated across sixselected slope areas at different longitudes and along three main depths. The macrobenthic standing stock and a-diversitywere lower in the deep-sea sediments of the eastern Mediterranean basin, compared to the western and central basins. Themacrofaunal standing stock and diversity decreased significantly from the upper bathyal to the lower bathyal slope stations.The major changes in the community composition of the higher taxa and in the trophic (functional) structure occurred atdifferent longitudes, rather than at increasing water depth. For the b-diversity, very high dissimilarities emerged at all levels:(i) between basins; (ii) between slopes within the same basin; and (iii) between stations at different depths; this thereforedemonstrates the high macrofaunal diversity of the Mediterranean basins at large spatial scales. Overall, the food sources(i.e., quantity and quality) that characterised the west, central and eastern Mediterranean basins, as well as sediment grainsize, appear to influence the macrobenthic standing stock and the biodiversity along the different slope areas."

OBIS contains 112,514 distinct marine species mainly originating from three major taxonomic groups: Crustacea, Mollusca, and Pisces. These three groups represent more than half of all data in OBIS, resulting in a high incompleteness of other taxonomic groups. Different oceanic regions show the same pattern: the same three groups were highly represented. Taxonomic gaps remain for other groups. Also in terms of depth, and geographical coverage gaps were found. Large parts of the open ocean are under sampled and do not represent a similar apparent species richness as other open ocean regions with higher sampling effort and completeness. The Chao2 species richness allowed the assessment of the completeness of OBIS data. Coastal areas mostly deliver reliable estimators, but the completeness stays low. These results can provide baselines for future assessments such as the World Ocean Assessment of the United Nations and can guide policy makers in setting priorities towards enhancing our knowledgebase by targeting gaps in taxonomy, ocean depth, and geographical coverage.The OBIS database also provided insights in species distribution changes. A poleward shift was detected with a narrowing range for tropical and temperate species. However, first results showed that polar shifted on average a movement towards the equator and an expanding range. Still, only the range for tropical species differed greatly, where a clear shift away from the equator was seen."	"Dujardin, F."	\N

The validity of Berghia has been questioned by some authors, who have considered it a junior synonym of Spurilla Bergh, 1864. The lack of consensus has caused confusion, blurring the differences between these two genera. A recent molecular phylogeny of Aeolidiidae supported the monophyly of Berghia and helped to resolve the controversy about its relationship with Spurilla. Here, specimens of Berghia from the eastern and western Atlantic were examined from molecular and morphological points of view. Berghia was found to be monophyletic, although its relationship with other aeolidiids was not resolved.

Recommendations are made for addressing some of the remaining knowledge deficiencies using a variety of traditional and more recently developed methods.

Many groups of deep-sea cephalopods require taxonomic reviews, ideally based on both morphological and molecular characters. Museum collections play a vital role in these revisions, and novel (molecular) techniques may facilitate new use of old museum specimens. Fundamental life-cycle parameters remain unknown for many species; techniques developed for neritic species that could potentially be applied to deep-sea cephalopods are discussed. Reproductive tactics and strategies in deep-sea cephalopods are very diverse and call for comparative evolutionary and experimental studies, but even in the twenty-first century, mature individuals are still unknown for many species. New insights into diet and trophic position have begun to reveal a more diverse range of feeding strategies than the typically voracious predatory lifestyle known for many cephalopods.

They are an important constituent of the deep-sea megafauna that are sometimes found in sufficient abundance to act as a significant source of habitat structure for meiofaunal and macrofaunal organisms. This study utilised maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) and a high-resolution environmental database to explore the environmental factors controlling the presence of Xenophyophorea and two frequently sampled xenophyophore species that are taxonomically stable: <i>Syringammina fragilissima</i> and <i>Stannophyllum zonarium</i>. These factors were also used to predict the global distribution of each taxon. Areas of high habitat suitability for xenophyophores were highlighted throughout the world?s oceans, including in a large number of areas yet to be suitably sampled, but the Northeast and Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, the Red Sea and deep-water regions of the Malay Archipelago represented particular hotspots. The two species investigated showed more specific habitat requirements when compared to the model encompassing all xenophyophore records, perhaps in part due to the smaller number and relatively more clustered nature of the presence records available for modelling at present. The environmental variables depth, oxygen parameters, nitrate concentration, carbon-chemistry parameters and temperature were of greatest importance in determining xenophyophore distributions, but, somewhat surprisingly, hydrodynamic parameters were consistently shown to have low importance, possibly due to the paucity of well-resolved global hydrodynamic datasets. The results of this study (and others of a similar type) have the potential to guide further sample collection, environmental policy, and spatial planning of marine protected areas and industrial activities that impact the seafloor, particularly those that overlap with aggregations of these conspicuously large single-celled eukaryotes."

BEMs were first built at a global extent to account for the full range of climatic conditions encountered by a given species. Habitat models were then built using fine-grained habitat variables at the scale of the Gulf of Gabes. We also used this hierarchical filtering approach to project the future distribution of these species under both climate change (the A2 scenario implemented with the Mediterranean climatic model NEMOMED8) and habitat loss (the loss of <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows) scenarios.ResultsThe hierarchical filtering approach predicted current species geographical ranges to be on average 56% smaller than those predicted using the BEMs alone. This pattern was also observed under the climate change scenario. Combining the habitat loss and climate change scenarios indicated that the magnitude of range shifts due to climate change was larger than from the loss of <i>P. oceanica</i> meadows.Main conclusionsOur findings emphasize that BEMs may overestimate current and future ranges of marine species if species–habitat relationships are not also considered. A hierarchical filtering approach that accounts for fine-grained habitat variables limits the uncertainty associated with model-based recommendations, thus ensuring their outputs remain applicable within the context of marine resource management."

Among them <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i> were dominant. About 84% of the gut isolates were capable of utilizing PAHs as sole carbon sources while 20% of isolates were found to produce biosurfactants. Production of surfactant along with capability to utilize PAH and other pollutants indicate the role of the gut community in alleviating the pollution stress. The results also show the potential source of microorganisms with industrial and environmental application.

Our analysis of gaps in high seas management indicates that a paradigm shift to a more systematic approach will be needed to safeguard high seas biodiversity from mounting threats. Experience from terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to effectively coordinate across multiple management regimes. We identify key elements for future high seas management and posit that a two-pronged approach is most promising: the development of an improved global legal regime that incorporates systematic planning as well as the expansion of existing and new regional agreements and mandates. This combined approach is most likely to achieve the required ecosystem-based, integrated and science-based management that world leaders at Rio acknowledged should underpin ocean management."

This taxon does not fit into current classifications. The isopods occurred in abyssal soft sediments, near manganese nodules, and in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents. Given their wide spatial occurrence across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, a cosmopolitan distribution is assumed. A cladistic analysis revealed a close relationship with the Macrostylidae, a common representative of the deep-sea macrofauna. Analyses of character evolution across the Janiroidea showed sufficient synapomorphies to justify the erection of <em><b>U</b></em><b><em>rstylis</em> gen. nov.</b> and the new family Urstylidae based on the three new species. All taxa are described in this paper. Urstylidae is characterized, amongst other apomorphies, by an elongate habitus with spade-like head; uropods are long, styliform; one pleonite is free; antennal merus and carpus are relatively short; the first pereopod is carpo-propodosubchelate, and more robust and shorter than pereopod II. Several characters, such as the pereopods’ posterior scale-like claw that basally encloses the distal sensilla may be interpreted as ancestral when compared to the situation in the highly derived Macrostylidae."

This enables reproducibility of research and creates new opportunities for integrating data between research projects and analysing data in additional ways. The long-term availability of data is especially important in conservation science because field data can be costly to collect. In addition, historic data, especially on threatened species and their associated biota, become more valuable over time. This paper summarises current standards and best practices for the management and publication of biodiversity data. It includes recommendations for citing sources of species determination and standards for formatting species distribution data. Whenever possible, data should be published for inclusion in data access platforms that integrate datasets (e.g. GBIF, GenBank) and so enable new analyses and broader impact. Data centres (e.g. PANGAEA) provide added value in quality checks on data. A minimum standard recommended is that data should be permanently archived in an online, open-access repository with sufficient metadata for potential users to understand how and why they were collected."

Diagnostic morphological characters are often missing or are obscured by the variation in sclerite forms. Consequently, species are difficult to assign to genera. In this study the current genera and their taxonomic positions are reviewed and reassessed based on material collected from the Indo-Pacific, Red Sea and Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa. Molecular data were obtained for four different loci, both mitochondrial (COI, mtMutS, ND6) and nuclear (28S rDNA). Combining the molecular and morphological data revealed that all former genera, except for the monotypic genus <i>Asperaxis</i> and the genus <i>Wrightella</i> are paraphyletic. Molecular data for the two subfamilies (Asperaxinae and Melithaeinae) within the Melithaeidae, in comparison with the outgroup, indicated that the family is also paraphyletic. Furthermore we observed that species did not cluster according to their present morphological classification but instead clustered according to a biogeographical pattern. Species from the Red Sea, Indian Ocean and Central Pacific, respectively, grouped into well supported clades. Consequently, we did not find morphological- or phylogenetic support to maintain the generic names <i>Acabaria</i>, <i>Clathraria</i>, <i>Mopsella</i> and <i>Wrightella</i>. Therefore these names are synonymised with the oldest available generic name, <i>Melithaea</i>.

A total of 7938 polychaetes belonging to 195 species were obtained in 136 grab samples collected at 27 sites. Three distinct assemblages were identified in the northern part of the SEAS margin (10–14°30?N), occupying the three sampled depth strata (shelf edge, upper and mid-slope) and two assemblages (shelf edge and slope) in the south (7–10°N). Highest density of polychaetes and dominance of a few species were observed in the shelf edge, where the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) impinged on the seafloor, particularly in the northern transects. The resident fauna in this region (<i>Cossura coasta</i>, <i>Paraonis gracilis</i>, <i>Prionospio</i> spp. and <i>Tharyx</i> spp.) were characteristically of smaller size, and well suited to thrive in the sandy sediments in OMZ settings. Densities were lowest along the most northerly transect (T9), where dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were extremely low (<0.15 ml l<sup>?1</sup>, i.e.&lt;6.7 ?mol l<sup>?1</sup>). Beyond the realm of influence of the OMZ (i.e. mid-slope, ~1000 m), the faunal density decreased while species diversity increased. The relative proportion of silt increased with depth, and the dominance of the aforementioned species decreased, giving way to forms such as <i>Paraprionospio pinnata</i>, <i>Notomastus</i> sp., <i>Eunoe</i> sp. and lumbrinerids. Relatively high species richness and diversity were observed in the sandy sediments of the southern sector (7–9°N), where influence of the OMZ was less intense. The area was also characterized by certain species (e.g. <i>Aionidella cirrobranchiata</i>, <i>Isolda pulchella</i>) that were nearly absent in the northern region. The gradients in DO concentration across the core and lower boundary of the OMZ, along with bathymetric and latitudinal variation in sediment texture, were responsible for differences in polychaete size and community structure on the SEAS margin. Spatial and temporal variations were observed in organic matter (OM) content of the sediment, but these were not reflected in the density, diversity or distribution pattern of the polychaetes."

Several aragonite crystals of geological origin were also investigated for comparison. The twin density is strongly dependent on the microstructures and species of the shells. The nacreous structure has a very low twin density regardless of the shell classes. On the other hand, the twin density in the crossed-lamellar (CL) structure has large variation among classes or subclasses, which is mainly related to the crystallographic direction of the constituting aragonite fibers. TEM observation suggests two types of twin structures in aragonite crystals with dense {110} twins: rather regulated polysynthetic twins with parallel twin planes, and unregulated polycyclic ones with two or three directions for the twin planes. The former is probably characteristic in the CL structures of specific subclasses of Gastropoda. The latter type is probably related to the crystal boundaries dominated by (hk0) interfaces in the microstructures with preferred orientation of the c-axis, and the twin density is mainly correlated to the crystal size in the microstructures."

This is the first phylogeny of the taxon to employ concatenated sequences of several genes, and it includes more than twice as many species as the last published molecular phylogeny of the entire group nearly a decade ago. Most of the numerous molecular phylogenies published during the last 15 years are limited to rather small fractions of its species diversity. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses are mostly congruent and confirm the presence of three previously reported highly divergent lineages among cone snails, and one identified here using molecular data. About 85% of the species cluster in the single Large Major Clade; the others are divided between the Small Major Clade (?12%), the <i>Conus californicus</i> lineage (one species), and a newly defined clade (?3%). We also define several subclades within the Large and Small major clades, but most of their relationships remain poorly supported. To illustrate the usefulness of molecular phylogenies in addressing specific evolutionary questions, we analyse the evolution of the diet, the biogeography and the toxins of cone snails. All cone snails whose feeding biology is known inject venom into large prey animals and swallow them whole. Predation on polychaete worms is inferred as the ancestral state, and diet shifts to molluscs and fishes occurred rarely. The ancestor of cone snails probably originated from the Indo-Pacific; rather few colonisations of other biogeographic provinces have probably occurred.

Since 2000, the coastal marine environments of the Pelagian Islands and of Sicily (central Mediterranean) have been increasingly colonized by exotic species (i.e. fishes and algae) originating both from the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. The studied areas (Pelagian Islands and SE Sicily) are located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, they represent an ideal place to understand how exotic species, coming from different Oceans, may have colonized ecological niches in the Mediterranean Sea.The objective of this study is to evaluate the colonization of benthic foraminiferal species which have migrated from the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea into the Mediterranean. The study shows that two species of <i>Amphistegina</i> (<i>lessonii</i> and <i>lobifera</i>) have massively colonized the Pelagian Islands. Furthermore, two ecomorphotypes of <i>Amphistegina</i> (<i>A</i>. cf. <i>lessonii</i> and <i>A</i>. cf. <i>papillosa</i>), never described up to now, have been found attached to exotic green algae, of Indo-Pacific origin. In the study area, Amphisteginids are so abundant that they can account for up to 90% of the total assemblage. In addition to <i>Amphistegina</i>, other exotic benthic foraminifera, such as <i>Amphisorus hemprichii</i>, have colonized the central Mediterranean Sea. The migration might have been through the Suez Canal, as a Lessepsian invasion. Alternatively, other species, such as <i>Sorites orbiculus</i> might have colonized the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, migrating through the Gibraltar gateway and/or from the Red Sea, via the Suez Canal."

Site-specific dynamics occur throughout the 1200 m depth gradient. The shallow assemblages divide into three types of warm-water mesotrophic foraminiferal assemblages, which is not only a consequence of high primary productivity restricting light to the benthos but due to low pore water oxygenation, shelf geomorphology, and sediment partitioning. In the intermediate depth (approx. 500 m), the increase in foraminiferal diversity is due to the cold-water coral habitat providing a greater range of micro niches. Planktonic species characterise the lower bathyal zone, which emphasizes the reduced benthic carbonate production at depth. Although, due to the strong hydrodynamics within the Golf, planktonic species occur in notable abundances through out the whole depth gradient. Overall, this study can easily be compared to other tropical marine settings investigating the long-term effects of tropical eutrophication and the biogeographic distribution of carbonate producing organisms."

282372	2014	AS	"Phenotypic vs genotypic approaches to biodiversity, from conflict to alliance"	"Taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological characters. Such a “phenotypic taxonomy” has steadily been replaced by the advent of molecular approaches, culminating with the rapid sequencing of genetic barcodes. The convenience of barcoding and its relative ease has relegated “phenotypic taxonomy” to a historical status. The use of genetics is undeniably powerful. It has relatively few biases and DNA can be extracted from challenging groups, where forms are fragile, such as jellyfish, or where early life stages are difficult to connect with adult forms. The problem is that resources are finite, and the rise of one powerful method came with the demise of traditional taxonomy. In addition, genetic methods may be very sophisticated, requiring acute expertise to master its techniques. These two points in combination have resulted in less funding and attraction for traditional approaches. This is doubly unfortunate because, first we are quickly losing experts in organisms that have incredibly complex lifestyles, and second because in order to fully appreciate a molecular taxonomy, one needs to understand the organisms. In a time of rapid loss of biodiversity, time is ripe for traditional and molecular taxonomists to unite in order to better appreciate and understand the complexity of life forms."

The Mid- to Late Holocene depositional environment mainly reflects inundation by the braid plain of the Arachthos and secondarily by the Louros River. The reconstruction of the depositional environments corresponds to a shallow marine and deltaic brackish lagoon and specifically to an environment proximal to river supply. The high rates of sedimentation, as well as the interpretation of depositional environments, indicate that the coastal sedimentological processes during the Mid- to Late Holocene were mainly controlled by the progradation of river deltas. Moreover, the geochemical proxies, the recovered molluscs and the microfauna, as well as the organic petrography analyses indicate periods of dysoxic and hypoxic conditions. These Holocene dysoxic and hypoxic events indicate that the recent dystrophic crises in the Amvrakikos Gulf are not only the result of human activities but also the contribution of natural processes."

We followed the changes of phytoplankton community structure in marine water every year from May to June. An intense bloom of coccolithophores <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> was observed in 2005–2006 when the nitrogen in marine water declined and the N/P ratio dropped below the Redfield proportion. In the 2007–2008, N/P ratio increased above the Redfield stoichiometry leading to the domination of the diatoms in phytoplankton community. The predominance of <i>E. huxleyi</i> was observed again in 2009–2010 and again it was associated with the decrease of the N/P ratio. To confirm the observation correlation between community composition and the mineral nutrient concentrations we undertook laboratory microcosm studies with addition of various amounts of a nitrogen and phosphorus sources to marine water. It was found that decreased nitrogen level and respective lower N/P stoichiometric ratio were essential precondition for coccolithophores domination. Under increased concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus near and above the Redfield stoichiometry, always encouraged the development of diatoms. We conclude that at least in the NE-part of the Black Sea, the composition of spring and summer phytoplankton is under strict environmental control by availability of mineral nutrients."

This article evaluates the feasibility of using remote sensing technology to delineate <i>S. spinulosa</i> reefs. <i>S. spinulosa</i> reef habitats associated with the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site were mapped using high resolution sidescan sonar (410 kHz) and multibeam echo sounder (<1 m<sup>2</sup>) data in 2005 (baseline), 2007 (pre-construction baseline) and 2012 (post-construction). The <i>S. spinulosa</i> reefs were identified in the acoustic data as areas of distinct irregular texturing. Maps created using acoustic data were validated using quantitative measures of reef quality, namely tube density (as a proxy for the density of live <i>S. spinulosa</i>), percentage cover of <i>S. spinulosa</i> structures (both living and dead) and associated macrofauna derived from seabed images taken across the development site. Statistically significant differences were observed in all physical measures of <i>S. spinulosa</i> as well the number (<i>S</i>) and diversity (<i>H</i>?) of associated species, derived from seabed images classified according to the presence or absence of reef, validating the use of high resolution sidescan sonar to map these important biogenic habitats. High precision mapping in the early stages allowed for the micro-siting of wind turbines in a way that caused minimal damage to <i>S. spinulosa</i> reefs during construction. These habitats have since recovered and expanded in extent. The surveys undertaken at the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site demonstrate the importance of repeat mapping for this emerging industry, allowing habitat enhancement to be attributed to the development whilst preventing background habitat degradation from being wrongly attributed to the development."

282295	2014	AS	Catch comparison between otter and rollerframe trawls: implications for sampling in seagrass beds	"The use of otter trawls as a sampling gear in habitats with shallow, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has been criticized due to its variable and low capture efficiency. Moreover, the area swept by otter trawls is dynamic both between and within tows; capture of fauna associated with seagrass can be strongly influenced by gear-induced turbulence, and animals are able to escape under the net that often rides on top of the SAV. We compared catch from the commonly-used otter trawl with that from the rollerframe trawl, which has not been previously evaluated for fishery-independent research purposes. We found that the rollerframe trawls had higher catch rates and caught more species of fauna in seagrass beds across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Among the species captured, 72% were more abundant in the rollerframe trawls compared to 11% more abundant in otter trawls (17% of species were captured at equal abundances). These results were consistent across sites and for a wide range of taxa. Additionally, the rollerframe trawls captured 25% more species than the otter trawls. Our findings suggest that rollerframe trawls generally have a higher capture efficiency than otter trawls in seagrass beds. We therefore recommend that the rollerframe trawl be used as an alternative or supplemental gear for ecologists and fisheries scientists working in seagrass beds."

Such differentials were investigated at four disparate localities in a bay lacking the callianassid bioturbation of other local sites. Here there were no such marked or consistent differences: <50% of differentials were statistically significant, with seagrass showing the lower, not higher, level in half of those. Overall, faunal abundance was lower in seagrass in the ratio of 0.64 : 1, whilst species density was higher but only by 1.13 to 1. Seagrass assemblages at a given locality were more similar to those of the adjacent bare sand than they were to seagrass assemblages at other localities, and likewise in respect of those in the bare sand. This suggests that marked differentials, where they occur, may result not from any supposed favourability of seagrass as a habitat but from the operation of processes within the unvegetated-sediment compartment of the system."

Tidal flats were the very habitat of interest with inclusion of subtidal areas. As part of review, a critical re-identification of taxa is provided together with the analysis of faunal assemblages and the regional distribution of the species. A total of 624 species belonging to ten phyla has been compiled from 72 references. The phylum Annelida was found to comprise most taxa (<i>n</i> = 248) followed by Mollusca (<i>n</i> = 196) and Arthropoda (<i>n</i> = 135). While annelids prevailed in the subtidal area compared into intertidal, mollusk and arthropod species prevailed in the intertidal. Among 17 regions across the west coast of Korea, the Incheon exhibited the largest number of macrobenthic animals (<i>n</i> = 272) followed by the Jeonjupo where 173 species have been reported over the past 30 years. More than half of all species compiled are reported from one region only while certain opportunistic polychaetes e.g. <i>Heteromastus filiformis</i> widely distributed across the coast.

The identification of unifying principles of organism functioning across all domains would facilitate a cause and effect understanding of such changes and their implications for ecosystem shifts. For example, the functional specialization of all organisms in limited temperature ranges leads us to ask for unifying functional reasons. Organisms also specialize in either anoxic or various oxygen ranges, with animals and plants depending on high oxygen levels. Here, we identify thermal ranges, heat limits of growth, and critically low (hypoxic) oxygen concentrations as proxies of tolerance in a meta-analysis of data available for marine organisms, with special reference to domain-specific limits. For an explanation of the patterns and differences observed, we define and quantify a proxy for organismic complexity across species from all domains. Rising complexity causes heat (and hypoxia) tolerances to decrease from Archaea to Bacteria to uni- and then multicellular Eukarya. Within and across domains, taxon-specific tolerance limits likely reflect ultimate evolutionary limits of its species to acclimatization and adaptation. We hypothesize that rising taxon-specific complexities in structure and function constrain organisms to narrower environmental ranges. Low complexity as in Archaea and some Bacteria provide life options in extreme environments. In the warmest oceans, temperature maxima reach and will surpass the permanent limits to the existence of multicellular animals, plants and unicellular phytoplankter. Smaller, less complex unicellular Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea will thus benefit and predominate even more in a future, warmer, and hypoxic ocean"	"Storch, D.; Menzel, L.; Frickenhaus, S.; Pörtner, H.O."

Ascomycota dominated, but OTUs belonging to Basidiomycota, Mucoromycotina and Chytridiomycota were also isolated. Nine OTUs could not be assigned to any fungal phylum. Almost half of the OTUs were considered non-marine. The western and eastern part of the Norwegian Barents Sea coast hosted different communities.

Consequently, the knowledge-base on non-indigenous species (NIS) continuously expands and so the number and availability of web resources on NIS rises. Currently there are more than 250 websites on NIS, ranging from global to regional and national. Many of these databases began as inventories of NIS, but evolved to include information on NIS origin, introduction history, pathways, vectors, and more. The databases have been used increasingly for scientific analyzes, though key information needs for bioinvasion management and research are only partially met. In this account we describe an advanced information system dealing with aquatic NIS introduced to marine, brackish and coastal freshwater environments of Europe and adjacent regions (AquaNIS). AquaNIS differs substantially from existing NIS information sources in its organizational principles, structure, functionality, and output potential for end-users, e.g., managing aquaculture or ship’s ballast water. The system is designed to assemble, store and disseminate comprehensive data on NIS, and assist the evaluation of the progress made towards achieving management goals. With the coming into force of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and similar legislation addressing the problem of biological invasions, the availability of advanced, scientifically validated and up-to-date information support on NIS is essential for aquatic ecosystem assessment and management.

Because the number of species in Canadian oceans remains uncertain, there is a need to incorporate molecular methods into species identifications. A 648 base pair segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene has proven useful for the identification and discovery of species in many animal lineages. While the utility of DNA barcoding in molluscs has been demonstrated in other studies, this is the first effort to construct a DNA barcode registry for marine molluscs across such a large geographic area.This study examines patterns of DNA barcode variation in 227 species of Canadian marine molluscs. Intraspecific sequence divergences ranged from 0–26.4% and a barcode gap existed for most taxa. Eleven cases of relatively deep (>2%) intraspecific divergence were detected, suggesting the possible presence of overlooked species. Structural variation was detected in COI with indels found in 37 species, mostly bivalves. Some indels were present in divergent lineages, primarily in the region of the first external loop, suggesting certain areas are hotspots for change. Lastly, mean GC content varied substantially among orders (24.5%–46.5%), and showed a significant positive correlation with nearest neighbour distances. DNA barcoding is an effective tool for the identification of Canadian marine molluscs and for revealing possible cases of overlooked species. Some species with deep intraspecific divergence showed a biogeographic partition between lineages on the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts, suggesting the role of Pleistocene glaciations in the subdivision of their populations. Indels were prevalent in the barcode region of the COI gene in bivalves and gastropods.

A good example is the red algal genus <i>Asparagopsis</i>. The two species (<i>A. armata</i> and <i>A. taxiformis</i>) recognized in this genus have been introduced in many places around the world. Within the nominal species <i>A. taxiformis</i>, previous molecular analyses have uncovered several lineages, suggesting the existence of sister species or subspecies. Although the genus has been well studied in some regions (e.g., the Mediterranean Sea and Hawaii), it remains poorly investigated in others (e.g., South Pacific). Our study mainly focused on these latter areas to clarify lineages and better determine lineage status (i.e., native vs. introduced). A total of 188 specimens were collected from 61 sites, 58 of which had never been sampled before. We sequenced the DNA from samples for three markers and obtained 112 sequences for the chloroplastic RuBisCo spacer, 118 sequences for the nuclear LSU rRNA gene, and 174 for the mitochondrial spacer cox2-3. Phylogenetic analyses using all three markers suggested the existence of two cryptic sister species with the discovery of a new clade within <i>A. armata</i>. This clade was found only in Western Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand, and is thus restricted to a subregional biogeographic unit. We also discovered a new, fifth lineage for <i>A. taxiformis </i>restricted to the South Pacific and Western Australia. Except for this newly described lineage, all other lineages showed a global distribution influenced by introduction events. These results illustrate the difficulty in accurately defining cosmopolitan species. Our findings also highlight the need for targeted (i.e., in poorly studied areas) and geographically extensive sampling efforts when studying taxa that have been introduced globally and that are likely to hide species complexes."

In addition, this marine group is characterized by an unusual large number of putatively cosmopolitan species. However, this ‘cosmopolitan’ status could be an artifact of their conserved morphology and the small number of unambiguous taxonomic characters available for delimiting species. Species delimitation can therefore be aided by molecular techniques. We investigated the case of the widespread and common species <i>Sipunculus nudus</i> Linnaeus, 1766 to determine its systematic validity. We analysed the morphology of multiple specimens of <i>S. nudus </i>collected from 11 localities around the world and undertook phylogenetic analyses using molecular sequence data from four genes (28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, histone H3 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I). High levels of genetic differentiation are present between distantly related populations of the putative species <i>S. nudus</i>. Five distinct lineages were identified by phylogenetic analyses, three of which – the best-represented populations – can be distinguished morphologically. Our phylogenetic and morphological analyses thus do not favor the cosmopolitan status of <i>S. nudus</i>, suggesting instead that it constitutes a complex of morphologically similar but distinguishable species."

Consistently with the CRAVED model of theft, illegally caught species were more Concealable (sold through more ports of convenience), more Removable (caught with longline vessels), more Abundant and Accessible (to known illegal fishing countries), more Valuable (larger), more Enjoyable (more often found in recipes) and more Disposable (highly commercial). Fisheries authorities should: (1) focus on ports of convenience, (2) monitor longliners, (3) exert pressure on known illegal fishing countries and (4) educate consumers about vulnerable species."

287627	2014	AS	Impacts of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles on marine organisms	"Increasing use of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles [Me(O)NPs] in products means many will inevitably find their way into marine systems. Their likely fate here is sedimentation following hetero-aggregation with natural organic matter and/or free anions, putting benthic, sediment-dwelling and filter feeding organisms most at risk. In marine systems, Me(O)NPs can absorb to micro-organisms with potential for trophic transfer following consumption. Filter feeders, especially bivalves, accumulate Me(O)NPs through trapping them in mucus prior to ingestion. Benthic in-fauna may directly ingest sedimented Me(O)NPs. In fish, uptake is principally via the gut following drinking, whilst Me(O)NPs caught in gill mucus may affect respiratory processes and ion transport. Currently, environmentally-realistic Me(O)NP concentrations are unlikely to cause significant adverse acute health problems, however sub-lethal effects e.g. oxidative stresses have been noted in many organisms, often deriving from dissolution of Ag, Cu or Zn ions, and this could result in chronic health impacts."

287645	2014	AS	Global biotic interactions: an open infrastructure to share and analyze species-interaction datasets	"An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI)."	"Simons, J.D.; Mungall, C.J."	WOS:000345810000016

Historically, there are few zooplankton time series in Australia, with no data sets longer than two years prior to 2008. Here we compile 98?676 abundance records of more than 1000 zooplankton taxa from unpublished research cruises, student projects, published literature, and the recent Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). This data set covers the entire coastal and shelf region of Australia and dates back to 1938. Most records are for copepods, but there are also data for other taxa such as decapods, chaetognaths, thaliaceans, appendicularians, and cladocerans. Metadata are provided for each record, including dates, coordinates, and information on mesh size and sampling methods. To facilitate analysis across the multiple data sets, we have updated the species names according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and converted units to abundance per cubic meter. These data will be valuable for studies of biodiversity, biogeography, impacts of climate change, and ecosystem health.

We collected many specimens from European waters (including the Swedish coast, near the type localities of these two species) and Hokkaido, Japan (as an alien population) and made molecular phylogenetic analyses using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, and found that in terms of COI sequences all the analyzed specimens were clustered into two distinct groups, one of which is morphologically referable to A. aspersa and the other to A. scabra.

According to hydrography and species composition, this region could be divided into 4 main areas: western and eastern branches of the WSC, the Greenland Sea together with Fram Strait, and the shelf areas of Spitsbergen and the Barents Sea. The most abundant species was <i>Oithona similis</i> and the most important, in terms of biomass, was <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>; both species were found at all stations. The novel spatial analysis method of principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) and the following variation partitioning were applied to disentangle the contributions of environmental variables and spatial differences in explaining mesozooplankton community variation. In spite of the large geographic area covered, environmental factors used in redundancy analysis (RDA) explained 30.6% of zooplankton variability, while the spatial distribution of sampling stations was responsible for 27.2%, and 12.5% was a common share of both predictors, coming from their correlations. We observed a smooth change from dominance of ubiquitous and boreo-Arctic taxa such as <i>O. similis </i> and <i>Triconia </i>sp. in the beginning of the study period towards stronger dominance of boreal taxa such as <i>C. finmarchicus</i>, which was the most abundant species in 2009."

Members of one group, the trematodes, occur as sexually mature adult worms in almost all Great Barrier Reef bony fish species. Although the first reports of these parasites were made 100 years ago, the fauna has been studied systematically for only the last 25 years. When the fauna was last reviewed in 1994 there were 94 species known from the Great Barrier Reef and it was predicted that there might be 2,270 in total. There are now 326 species reported for the region, suggesting that we are in a much improved position to make an accurate prediction of true trematode richness. Here we review the current state of knowledge of the fauna and the ways in which our understanding of this fascinating group is changing. Our best estimate of the true richness is now a range, 1,100–1,800 species. However there remains considerable scope for even these figures to be incorrect given that fewer than one-third of the fish species of the region have been examined for trematodes.

We used satellite telemetry and a switching state-space model to identify distinct foraging areas used by 59 NGoM loggerheads tagged during 2010–2013. We tagged turtles after nesting at three sites, 1 in Alabama (Gulf Shores; n = 37) and 2 in Florida (St. Joseph Peninsula; n = 20 and Eglin Air Force Base; n = 2). Peak migration time was 22 July to 9 August during which &gt;40% of turtles were in migration mode; the mean post-nesting migration period was 23.0 d (±13.8 d SD). After displacement from nesting beaches, 44 turtles traveled to foraging sites where they remained resident throughout tracking durations. Selected foraging locations were variable distances from tagging sites, and in 5 geographic regions; no turtles selected foraging sites outside the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Foraging sites delineated using 50% kernel density estimation were located a mean distance of 47.6 km from land and in water with mean depth of -32.5 m; other foraging sites, delineated using minimum convex polygons, were located a mean distance of 43.0 km from land and in water with a mean depth of -24.9 m. Foraging sites overlapped with known trawling activities, oil and gas extraction activities, and the footprint of surface oiling during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (n = 10). Our results highlight the year-round use of habitats in the GoM by loggerheads that nest in the NGoM.

The main component of this protocol consisted of the access rights for 300,000 t/yr of small pelagics. During the first five months after the signature of the protocol, no EU pelagic trawlers used the opportunities created by the protocol. Only after the formal approval of the protocol by the European Council in December 2013, some eastern EU member states started sending their pelagic trawlers back to Mauritania. This resulted in a utilisation of the protocol of 54% for the whole of 2013. Although the EU repeatedly stated that the €70 million/yr paid under the protocol provided good value for money, this assertion was hard to maintain considering the limited utilisation of the agreement. The paper analyses why the EU concluded an agreement with Mauritania that was not wanted by their industry and that was therefore only partially used in the end. It describes the decision making process inside the EU; the different parties involved and their different objectives. It is concluded that the EU decision making process suffers from a lack of transparency and that the combination of a business agreement with development aid resulted in an agreement which did not attain either of the stated objectives. It is proposed that in future the two aspects are clearly separated, and that the development component is extended to other countries in West Africa, including those that have no fish to sell to the EU."

Mapping and estimating national green GDPs is a challenging task. In this study, we estimated the global market and non-market monetary values using two images, GlobCover 2009 and nighttime satellite imagery, as well as a comprehensive dataset. We also developed an integrated method supported by geographic information system (GIS) techniques, focused on spatial heterogeneity and real value, to create synthetic green GDP maps at global and national scales. Our results show that in 2009, for the entire biosphere, the ecosystem services value (ESV) could be estimated at US$ 149.61 trillion. Approximately 75.15% of the ESV is contributed by marine systems. The world GDP in 2009 was about US$ 71.75 trillion (for 225 countries or regions), resulting in a ratio of total ESV to GDP of approximately 2.09–1. Nighttime satellite imagery represents a more spatially explicit indicator of market value than does GDP. We also found that the distribution of the synthetic national green GDPs follows Zipf's Law, which holds that internal coherence exists among countries. A crude but simple indicator of the %ESV indicates that the relationship between the GDP and ESV is not always in a fixed pattern. The reliability of this result was demonstrated by comparing it with previous research and other relevant indices. We found a very high degree of confidence associated with this product. The method presented here is generally applicable at the global and continental scales and is applicable at the national scale for mapping the ESV and GDP. We hope that the results of this study will inform both policy-makers and the public about national green GDPs and encourage them to incorporate these values into policy decisions."

246834	2014	AS	Positive feedback loop between introductions of non-native marine species and cultivation of oysters in Europe	"With globalization, agriculture and aquaculture activities are increasingly affected by diseases that are spread through movement of crops and stock. Such movements are also associated with the introduction of non-native species via hitchhiking individual organisms. The oyster industry, one of the most important forms of marine aquaculture, embodies these issues. In Europe disease outbreaks affecting cultivated populations of the naturalized oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> caused a major disruption of production in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mitigation procedures involved massive imports of stock from the species’ native range in the northwestern Pacific from 1971 to 1977. We assessed the role stock imports played in the introduction of non-native marine species (including pathogens) from the northwestern Pacific to Europe through a methodological and critical appraisal of record data. The discovery rate of non-native species (a proxy for the introduction rate) from 1966 to 2012 suggests a continuous vector activity over the entire period. Disease outbreaks that have been affecting oyster production since 2008 may be a result of imports from the northwestern Pacific, and such imports are again being considered as an answer to the crisis. Although successful as a remedy in the short and medium terms, such translocations may bring new diseases that may trigger yet more imports (self-reinforcing or positive feedback loop) and lead to the introduction of more hitchhikers. Although there is a legal framework to prevent or reduce these introductions, existing procedures should be improved."	"Mineur, F.; Le Roux, A; Maggs, A; Verlaque, M"	WOS:000344794200024

Species is obviously the basic taxonomic level to which most ecological studies and theories refer. Identification at this level of organization is indeed always preferred over any other taxonomic level. Nevertheless, aggregation of species to higher taxonomic levels may be unavoidable sometimes, since errors of identification are known or suspected to occur in many surveys. Using analyses of taxonomic sufficiency (identification of organisms at various taxonomic resolutions) and groups of morphospecies (taxa identified easily by non-experts on the basis of evident morphological traits), this study aims to quantify the loss of ecological information incurred by partial identification of benthic megafauna in bottom trawl surveys in order to put such data to good use. The analyses were conducted on five scientific surveys representing a large range of geographical areas (from 150 km<sup>2</sup> to 150 000 km<sup>2</sup>) and environmental conditions. Results show that genus, family and, particularly, morphospecies are good surrogates for species identification in community analyses. We suggest that bottom trawl surveys can provide reliable megafauna data that may usefully complete those obtained by grab surveys. The use of morphospecies could lead to new strategies, combining different datasets to provide indicators for MSFD descriptors (e.g. D6)."

Phylogenetics and systematic of oysters based on morphology have proved difficult because of their high phenotypic plasticity. In this study we explore the phylogenetic information of the DNA sequence and secondary structure of the nuclear, fast-evolving, ITS2 rRNA and the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes from the Ostreidae and we implemented a multi-locus framework based on four loci for oyster phylogenetics and systematics. Sequence-structure rRNA models aid sequence alignment and improved accuracy and nodal support of phylogenetic trees. In agreement with previous molecular studies, our phylogenetic results indicate that none of the currently recognized subfamilies, Crassostreinae, Ostreinae, and Lophinae, is monophyletic. Single gene trees based on Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) methods and on sequence-structure ML were congruent with multilocus trees based on a concatenated (ML and BA) and coalescent based (BA) approaches and consistently supported three main clades: (i) <i>Crassostrea</i>, (ii)<i> Saccostrea</i>, and (iii) an Ostreinae-Lophinae lineage. Therefore, the subfamily Crassotreinae (including <i>Crassostrea</i>), Saccostreinae subfam. nov.

Based on phylogenetic and biogeographical evidence the Asian species of <i>Crassostrea</i> from the Pacific Ocean are assigned to <i>Magallana</i> gen. nov., whereas an integrative taxonomic revision is required for the genera <i>Ostrea</i> and <i>Dendostrea</i>. This study pointed out the suitability of the ITS2 marker for DNA barcoding of oyster and the relevance of using sequence-structure rRNA models and features of the ITS2 folding in molecular phylogenetics and taxonomy.

New patterns continue to emerge showing that the deep-sea can be dynamic on short time scales, rather than static over long periods. In just over 2 years the community shifted from a sessile, suspension-feeding, sponge-dominated community to a mobile, detritus-feeding, sea cucumber-dominated assemblage. In 2006 megafaunal diversity (Simpson’s Diversity Index, SDI) was high, yet the community was depauperate in terms of density compared to later periods. Over an 18-month period beginning in spring 2011, the densities of mobile organisms increased by nearly an order of magnitude while diversity decreased below 2006 levels. In late 2012 four sea cucumbers (two Peniagone spp., Elpidia sp. A, and <i>Scotoplanes globose</i>) were at the highest densities recorded since investigations began at Station M in 1989. For a group of 10 echinoderms investigated over the entire study period, we saw evidence of a long-term cycle spanning 2 decades. These changes can be tied to a variable food supply originating in shallow water. Large variations over decadal-scales indicate that remote abyssal communities are dynamic and likely subject to impacts from anthropogenic changes like ocean warming, acidification, and pollution manifested in the upper ocean.

287833	2014	AS	Macroevolutionary patterns of sexual size dimorphism in copepods	"Major theories compete to explain the macroevolutionary trends observed in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in animals. Quantitative genetic theory suggests that the sex under historically stronger directional selection will exhibit greater interspecific variance in size, with covariation between allometric slopes (male to female size) and the strength of SSD across clades. Rensch's rule (RR) also suggests a correlation, but one in which males are always the more size variant sex. Examining free-living pelagic and parasitic Copepoda, we test these competing predictions. Females are commonly the larger sex in copepod species. Comparing clades that vary by four orders of magnitude in their degree of dimorphism, we show that isometry is widespread. As such we find no support for either RR or for covariation between allometry and SSD. Our results suggest that selection on both sexes has been equally important. We next test the prediction that variation in the degree of SSD is related to the adult sex ratio. As males become relatively less abundant, it has been hypothesized that this will lead to a reduction in both inter-male competition and male size. However, the lack of such a correlation across diverse free-living pelagic families of copepods provides no support for this hypothesis. By comparison, in sea lice of the family Caligidae, there is some qualitative support of the hypothesis, males may suffer elevated mortality when they leave the host and rove for sedentary females, and their female-biased SSD is greater than in many free-living families. However, other parasitic copepods which do not appear to have obvious differences in sex-based mate searching risks also show similar or even more extreme SSD, therefore suggesting other factors can drive the observed extremes."

"Cowries (Cypraeidae) are diverse and occur in all tropical and some temperate seas, from shallow waters to the deep sea. There is a vast literature documenting the distribution, taxonomy, and shell variation, among many other topics. Because of its popularity among shell collectors, amateurs have contributed more to the cowrie literature than to most molluscan families. Traditionally, taxa have been described based on shell characters, and the majority of species descriptions continue to be published in non-peer-reviewed journals, magazines and books. Molecular studies in the last two decades have largely confirmed phylogenies based on morphology and anatomy. Currently, 245 species and 166 subspecies (or 411 operational taxonomic units) are recognized in 48 genera in the family. Despite being the best-known seashell family, the discovery curve suggests that there are still more taxa to be discovered. A review of the knowledge of the family is presented, and information on each genus is summarized."	"Moretzsohn, F."	WOS:000343852900016

A total of 104 loggerhead turtles stranded along the coasts of eastern Spain during 1995–2006 were surveyed for epibionts. A total of 39 epibiont taxa were identified, three of them being new records for loggerhead turtles: <i>Bittium </i>sp.,<i> Idotea metallica</i> and Jassa sp. The assemblage was composed of a group of 27 facultative taxa that use turtles as any inanimate buoyant substrate, and 12 taxa that have developed more specific associations to marine turtles, including six species that occur in marine turtles exclusively, two that dwell also on other hosts, and four that can also survive as free-living forms but have developed a strong association with marine turtles. Hierarchical clustering and Similarity Profile Analysis based on the occurrence of 166 epibiont taxa from nine available surveys indicated that the epibiont assemblages from loggerhead turtles in the western Mediterranean (WM) are similar to those from Central Mediterranean (CM), but significantly different from turtles surveyed in the eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The subset of epibionts occurring on WM and CM turtles is defined by a combination of geographic factors (exclusive Mediterranean epibiont taxa) and ecological factors (relative absence of littoral-benthic taxa). Loggerhead turtles from WM and CM apparently exploit both pelagic and benthic habitats in similar fashion, representing a homogeneous unit for epibiont recruitment."

This polychaete species has invaded intertidal benthic rocky shores, and builds reefs formed by thousands of individuals per square meter with densities up to 1,500,000 ind.·m<sup>?2</sup> in organically impacted sites. This phenomenon was first recorded in Argentina in 2008. This is the first comprehensive study on the morphology, habitat and reproductive biology of <i>B. proboscidea</i> associated with the sewage-induced abrasion platforms on the Argentinean coasts. Adult morphology of <i>B. proboscidea</i> from Mar del Plata is described and a comparison with material from other locations is made. Results showed that <i>B. proboscidea</i> from Mar del Plata, Argentina share the same diagnostic features as those of the individuals from the original description (California). Moreover, the results also indicated that the reproduction of this species involves a poecilogonous development (production of more than one type of offspring with both kinds of larvae) and implicates adelphophagy (nurse egg ingestion). Patterns of larval development varied both within a single brood and among broods of different females. Continuous reproduction of <i>B. proboscidea</i> coupled with a continuous supply of organic matter could explain the possible mechanism that led to the development of reefs."

287952	2014	AS	A review of the Polystira clade—the Neotropic’s largest marine gastropod radiation (Neogastropoda: Conoidea: Turridae <i>sensu stricto</i>)	"The <i>Polystira</i> clade (here comprising <i>Polystira</i> and <i>Pleuroliria</i>) is a poorly known but hyper-diverse clade within the neogastropod family Turridae (sensu stricto). It has extensively radiated within the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, to which it is endemic. In this paper we present a synthetic overview of existing information on this radiation together with new information on estimated species diversity, systematic relationships, a species-level molecular phylogenetic analysis and preliminary macroecological and diversification analyses, to serve as a platform for further study. We currently estimate that about 300 species (122 extant) are known from its 36 million year history but this number will undoubtedly increase as we extend our studies. We discuss the relationships of <i>Polystira</i> to other Neotropical Turridae (s.s.) and examine the taxonomy and systematics of the geologically oldest described members of the clade. To aid taxonomic description of shells we introduce a new notation for homologous major spiral cords. Focusing on key publications, we discuss in detail the changing historical understanding of the taxonomy of the clade and the relationships of its component genus-level taxa: <i>Polystira</i> Woodring, 1928, <i>Pleuroliria</i> de Gregorio, 1890, Josephina Gardner, 1945 and <i>Oxytropa</i> Glibert, 1955. We designate a neotype for <i>Pleurotoma (Pleuroliria) supramirifica</i> de Gregorio, 1890, to stabilize our understanding of this, the type species of <i>Pleuroliria</i>. Application of the name <i>Oxytropa</i> is restricted to the type species. The genus <i>Polystira</i> is conchologically re-described and for the first time we synthesize available information on the anatomy, feeding and toxinology, reproduction and life history, larval modes and life habits, and geographic and bathymetric ranges of its species. We give an updated list of the 19 formally described living species and present the pitfalls of the currently poor species-level taxonomy of <i>Polystira</i> using case examples. We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 22 extant species using three mitochondrial gene fragments (COI, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA). This reveals undescribed species and indicates that Recent genetic clades (‘biospecies’) are consistent with finely divided conchological ‘morphospecies’. Historically, there has been a slow realisation of the high species diversity of the <i>Polystira</i> clade and we consider that this may be due to inadequate precision of morphological description of shells and a lack of clear homology statements. We suggest how these both might be improved. Finally, using a data compilation based on museum specimens  we examine species range-size distributions and species abundance distributions for 85 of the 112 extant western Atlantic species that we have delimited to date. Our results indicate that the majority of species are rare and have short geographic ranges; only a few are wide-ranging and abundant. This has important implications for surveys of biodiversity."

The sea lice <i>Caligus epinepheli</i> Yamaguti, 1936 (Caligidae) was collected from the Japanese threadfin bream, <i>Nemipterus japonicus</i> (Bloch). It had been frequently reported from teleost fishes around the world. The second record, comprising male and female, was another caligid, rarely caught from fishes — <i>Hermilius longicornis</i> Bassett-Smith, 1898, collected from the giant catfish, <i>Netuma thalassina</i> (Rüppell). This paper features the first description of the male of the latter species. The third record was the lernanthropid, <i>Lernanthropinus temminckii</i> (von Nordmann, 1864) (Lernanthropidae), redescribed based on the specimens collected from the greater lizard fish, <i>Saurida tumbil</i> (Bloch) (Synodontidae). In order to clarify its taxonomic status, our specimen was compared with the holotype of <i>L. gibbosus</i> (Pillai, 1964) from the collections of Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, and the syntypes of <i>L. sauridae</i> Do in Ho and Do, 1985 and <i>L. temminckii</i> from the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. We found similarities in the morphology of the body, mouthparts, and legs 1–4 in three above-mentioned species. The prominent feature, the setation pattern of legs 1 and 2 was similar in all the female specimens examined. In the light of this, we formally relegate <i>L. gibbosus</i> and <i>L. sauridae</i> to synonymy with <i>L. temminckii</i>. Another important similarity is that <i>Lernanthropinus gibbosus, L. sauridae</i>, and <i>L. temminckii</i> have exclusively been parasitic on lizardfishes (Synodontidae).

The present-day water depth within the bay slightly exceeds 2 m at low tide and the seafloor is almost entirely muddy, except for the outermost part of the embayment which is directly influenced by the longshore drift that is building the Laem Talumpuk sand spit. A multivariate analysis of the molluscan fauna recovered at 16 sampling stations within the bay delineates three thanatofacies and two biofacies. The Bay Mouth thanatofacies, including several infralittoral species, is distributed around the bay entrance; the Tidal Flat thanatofacies, characterized by few brackish and freshwater taxa, occurs in the inner part of the bay; the Channel thanatofacies includes a mixed fauna and is found along the long axis of the bay. All thanatofacies are not older than a few decades. The two biofacies are significantly less diverse than their dead counterparts, and are simply identified as Bay Mouth biofacies and Inner Bay biofacies. The faunal evolution, combined with bathymetric and sedimentological data, confirms that the embayment is undergoing a confinement process. The inner bay has evolved into an undifferentiated tidal flat hosting an oligospecific fauna. The confinement trend and the consequent siltation of the bay, mainly due to natural geomorphologic processes acting since centuries, are likely to have sped up in recent years by interaction with some human activities: among these, the deforestation in the upper Pak Phanang basin and the construction of Uthokaviphatprasit Watergate."

252965	2014	AS	"Europe's top 10 invasive species: relative importance of climatic, habitat and socio-economic factors"	"Using a representative set of 10 of the worst invasive species in Europe, this study investigates the relative importance of climatic, habitat and socio-economic factors in driving the occurrence of invasive species. According to the regression models performed, these factors can be interpreted as multi-scale filters that determine the occurrence of invasive species, with human degradation potentially affecting the performance of the other two environmental filters. Amongst climate factors, minimum temperature of the coldest month was one of the most important drivers of the occurrence of Europe’s worst freshwater and terrestrial invaders like the red swamp crayfish (<i>Procambarus clarkii</i>), Bermuda buttercup (<i>Oxalis pes-caprae</i>) and Sika deer (<i>Cervus nippon</i>). Water chemistry (alkalinity, pH, nitrate) determines the availability of habitat and resources for species at regional to local levels and was relevant to explain the occurrence of aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders such as the brook trout (<i>Salvalinus fontinallis</i>) and Canada goose (<i>Branta canadensis</i>). Likewise, nitrate and cholorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration were important determinants of marine invaders like the bay barnacle (<i>Balanus improvisus</i>) and green sea fingers (<i>Codium fragile</i>). Most relevant socio-economic predictors included the density of roads, country gross domestic product (GDP), distance to ports and the degree of human influence on ecosystems. These variables were particularly relevant to explain the occurrence of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) and coypu (<i>Myocastor coypu</i>), species usually associated to disturbed environments. The Japanese kelp (<i>Undaria pinnatifida</i>) was generally distributed much closer to ports than the other two marine organisms, although insufficient information on human impacts prevented a correct assessment of the three marine species. In conclusion, this study shows how socio-economic development is associated with the presence of the top 10 worst European invasive species at a continental scale, and relates this fact to the provision and transport of propagules and the degradation of natural habitats that favour the establishment of invasive species."

Also, the relative importance of different drivers of species distributions are compared through species distribution modelling.Location The South African beaches are among the best-studied in the world, providing sufficient biological data for the analyses. There is also a well-established coastal protected-area network that putatively provides moderate protection to nearly all beach habitats.Methods Species distribution maps of beach-dependent vertebrates, macrofauna, microflora, and foredune vegetation were compiled from existing sources or modelled using standard techniques. While some data were available for the latter analyses, additional sampling was required to improve bioregional coverage. Each species' distribution was coded to a detailed map of the South African shoreline. Representation of habitats and species in various configurations of existing reserves was determined.Results Overall, 535 species have been recorded on the South African sandy shores, including 139 common species. Endemism is variable among taxonomic groups. Notably, two-thirds of the macrofauna are regional endemics, half of which are endemic to South Africa. For almost all of the common species, < 20 % of their distributions are protected in land-sea reserves. Protection of beach habitats is similarly poor; conservation targets were not met in all cases, and most habitat types are considered poorly protected.Main conclusions Sandy beach communities are considerably more diverse than they are generally acknowledged to be, and comprise a unique suite of biota. Given the species' narrow distributions and high degree of exposure to threats, many probably qualify as threatened/endangered. In spite of this, beaches are poorly represented in coastal reserve networks. To redress this issue, conservation planners need to account for beaches specifically, and to ensure they are represented in contiguous land-sea protected areas."

The Gulf Stream was first identified as a strong open-ocean feature in 1513 and by the eighteenth century, regular transatlantic voyages by sailing ships had established the general patterns of winds and circulation, enabling optimisation of passage times. Differences in water temperature, water colour and species of animals were recognised as important cues for navigation. Systematic collection of information from ships' logs enabled Maury (The Physical Geography of the Sea Harper and Bros. New York 1855) to produce a chart of prevailing winds across the entire world's oceans, and by the early twentieth century the global surface ocean circulation that defines the major biogeographic regions was well-known. This information was further supplemented by data from large-scale plankton surveys. The launch of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, specifically designed to study living marine resources on board the Nimbus 7 polar orbiting satellite in 1978, marked the advent of the satellite era. Over subsequent decades, correlation of satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll data with in situ measurements enabled Longhurst (Ecological Geography of the Sea. Academic Press, New York 1998) to divide the global ocean into 51 ecological provinces with Polar, Westerly Wind, Trade Wind and Coastal Biomes clearly recognisable from earlier subdivisions of the oceans. Satellite imagery with semi-synoptic images of large areas of the oceans greatly aided definition of boundaries between provinces. However, ocean boundaries are dynamic, varying from season to season and year to year. More recent work has focused on the study of variability of currents, fronts and eddies, which are often the focus of high biological productivity. Direct tracking of animals using satellite-based systems has helped resolve the biological function of such features and indeed animals instrumented in this way have helped the study of such features in three dimensions, including depths beyond the reach of conventional satellite remote sensing. Patterns of surface productivity detected by satellite remote sensing are reflected in deep sea life on the sea floor at abyssal depths > 3,000 m. Satellite remote sensing has played a major role in overcoming the problems of large spatial scales and variability in ocean dynamics and is now an essential tool for monitoring global change."

252973	2014	AS	A global gap analysis of sea turtle protection coverage	"Although the number and extent of protected areas (PAs) are continuously increasing, their coverage of global biodiversity, as well as criteria and targets that underline their selection, warrants scrutiny. As a case study, we use a global dataset of sea turtle nesting sites (n = 2991) to determine the extent to which the existing global PA network encompasses nesting habitats (beaches) that are vital for the persistence of the seven sea turtle species. The majority of nesting sites (87%) are in the tropics, and are mainly hosted by developing countries. Developing countries contain 82% nesting sites, which provide lower protection coverage compared to developed countries. PAs encompass 25% of all nesting sites, of which 78% are in marine PAs. At present, most nesting sites in PAs with IUCN ratification receive high protection. We identified the countries that provide the highest and lowest nesting site protection coverage, and detected gaps in species-level protection effort within countries. No clear trend in protection coverage was found in relation to gross domestic product, the Global Peace Index or sea turtle regional management units; however, countries in crisis (civil unrest, war or natural catastrophes) provided slightly higher protection coverage of all countries. We conclude that global sea turtle resilience against threats spanning temperate to tropical regions require representative PA coverage at the species level within countries. This work is anticipated to function as a first step towards identifying specific countries or regions that should receive higher conservation interest by national and international bodies."

In this context, we comparatively mapped ribosomal RNA and histone gene families on the chromosomes of <i>Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis, M. trossulus</i> and <i>M. californianus</i> by fluorescent <i>in situ</i>  hybridization (FISH). Major rRNA, core and linker histone gene clusters mapped to different chromosome pairs in the four taxa. In contrast, minor rRNA gene clusters showed a different behavior. In all <i>Mytilus</i> two of the 5S rDNA clusters mapped to the same chromosome pair and one of them showed overlapping signals with those corresponding to one of the histone H1 gene clusters. The overlapping signals on mitotic chromosomes became a pattern of alternate 5S rRNA and linker histone gene signals on extended chromatin fibers. Additionally, <i>M. trossulus</i> showed minor and major rDNA clusters on the same chromosome pair.

Our specimens bore a morphological resemblance to the slipper cupped oyster <i>C. bilineata</i> (syn. <i>C. iredalei</i>), consistent with their close phylogenetic relationship. Some of the shell characteristics represented in the original species description were not applicable to our specimens, especially in terms of the pattern of their inner-shell coloration. Our novel finding of <i>C. dianbaiensis</i> in Japan updated the taxon list of Japanese <i>Crassostrea</i> species."

During research cruises in 2004 and 2011, the shelf region of Angola was investigated at 39 stations in water depths of between 19 and 340 m. Most of the stations were characterised by fine sediments, e.g. silt and sand. In all, 67 quantitative grab samples and 20 qualitative dredge samples were collected. The study area extended from c. 7° S to the Namibian border at c. 17° S. A total of 893 different taxa were collected, with polychaetes and crustaceans the most diverse groups and polychaetes the most abundant. Overall, molluscs had the greatest biomass. The diversity values (Shannon index) were &gt;3.5 and in some cases even &gt;4.5 for a large part of the shelf, but they did not show any latitudinal trend. A multivariate analysis revealed high variability in community composition between stations and without real grouping, except for a separate community in an oxygen-poor (?1 ml l<sup>?1</sup>) region near the Namibian border in southern Angola, where there was a limited number of species that are well adapted to such conditions. These species occurred at high abundance and biomass and included gastropods of the genus <i>Nassarius</i> and the bivalve <i>Nuculana bicuspidata</i>. There was also a marked presence of the polychaetes <i>Cossura coasta</i>, <i>Diopatra neapolitana capensis</i> and <i>Galathowenia</i> sp. in this region. The latter two species were also conspicuous in the better-oxygenated waters of the northern areas, however. Other taxa, such as the polychaete <i>Prionospio</i> as well as the amphipod <i>Ampelisca</i>, were strongly represented along the entire Angolan shelf."	"Lange, G.; Darr, A.; Zettler, M.L."

Phylogenetic approaches have revealed that different lineages of <i>Conus</i> evolved divergent venoms, a property that is exploited to enhance the discovery of new conotoxins, but is rarely used in taxonomy. Specimens belonging to the Indo-West Pacific <i>Conus lividus</i> species complex were analyzed using phenetic and phylogenetic methods based on shell morphology, COI and 28S rRNA gene sequences and venom mRNA expression and protein composition. All methods converged to reveal a new species, <i>C. conco</i> n. sp. (described in Supplementary data), restricted to the Marquesas Islands, where it diverged recently (?3&nbsp;mya) from <i>C. lividus</i>. The geographical distribution of <i>C. conco</i> and <i>C. lividus</i> and their phylogenetic relationships suggest that the two species diverged in allopatry. Furthermore, the diversity of the transcript sequences and toxin molecular masses suggest that <i>C. conco</i> evolved unique toxins, presumably in response to new selective pressure, such as the availability of new preys and ecological niches. Furthermore, this new species evolved new transcripts giving rise to original toxin structures, probably each carrying specific biological activity."

Samples were taken with a Pelagic Trawl and an IKMT in the upper 600 m of the water column, targeting larger and middle-sized nektonic species, respectively. Fourteen species were collected: five dendrobranchiate shrimps, eight caridean shrimps and one scyllarid lobster.

Others were exclusive of the middle slope: <i>Pasiphaea multidentata</i>, and <i>Sergia robusta</i>. <i>Pasiphaea sivado</i> and <i>Gennadas elegans</i> occurred in all pelagic strata. Multivariate analyses showed several distinct assemblages related to bathymetry and sampling depth. No significant differences were found concerning zone or sampled seasons. Bathymetrically, Deep Scattering Layers showed the highest diversity. No decapod crustaceans occurred in epipelagic daytime samples.

260490	2014	AS	A new critical estimate of named species-level diversity of the recent Mollusca	"Modern estimates of species-level diversity in the recent Mollusca range from 34,000 to 120,000 described species, with total diversity including undescribed species often cited as 200,000. Most estimates are unverifiable, not being based on reproducible methods. Ultimately the best way to gauge diversity is explicit enumeration: actual listing of known species. Comprehensive lists of species are valued as a basis for systematic revisions and for comparing diversity across taxa, but it is less appreciated that they also provide a means for statistical sampling of biodiversity databases. I assessed the completeness of molluscan species listings in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) by comparing it to a standardized inventory of the species represented in the Malacology collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP). Random samples of names were scored for presence or absence in WoRMS, with standard errors calculated from the binomial distribution. The WoRMS database has about 1,200 duplicate or extraneous listings for mollusk species and is missing about 1,300 (3%). Overall marine molluscan diversity is estimated at 43,600 ± 900 species, where 900 is a 95% confidence interval. The validity of this confidence interval depends on the WoRMS database and the ANSP collection not having correlated weaknesses. Lack of relatively complete species databases prevents similar assessments for terrestrial and freshwater mollusks, but, using less rigorous methods, I estimate that there are 70,000 to 76,000 described species of recent Mollusca.</p> <p class=""last"">The low end of this estimate, 70,000 species, is similar to the number of recent chordate species, 69,000, so it is possible that the Mollusca are not the second most diverse phylum of animals in terms of recognized recent species. Naming rates for chordate are currently higher than for mollusk, 750 versus 600 species per year, although the Mollusca are regarded as having higher undescribed diversity. The Mollusca have long been considered the most species-rich marine phylum, but the estimate of 43,600 is substantially below the 56,000 species of Arthropoda listed in WoRMS. Globally, the ratio of marine gastropod to marine bivalve species in WoRMS is 4:1, which is higher than in any regional fauna, suggesting that gastropods have smaller geographic ranges on average than bivalves. The main remaining gaps in WoRMS are among opisthobranchs (8% missing) and Indo-Pacific marine mollusks (6%). The most diverse molluscan genus in WoRMS is <i>Turbonilla</i>, with more than 1,000 species listed as accepted."	"Rosenberg, G."	WOS:000343852900018

Surveys were conducted with the same method (time-based visual census along random paths), in the same sites, by the same people. Semi-quantitative inventories of conspicuous species were analysed by univariate and multivariate techniques. Available information on the main potential stressors indicated that a regime shift has occurred in these 30+ years: sea surface temperature rose by1-2°C, human pressure grew impressively, and invasion by several alien species took place. Consistently, a phase shift occurred in the biological communities. Of the 120 conspicuous species found in total, only 51 were common to both surveys; 31 species (‘losses’) were found in 1981 but not again in 2013, 38 (‘gains’) were found exclusively in 2013, 16 (‘winners’) increased their abundance, 8 (‘losers’) got scarcer, and 27 underwent little or no change. Gains included 7 alien, 2 nitrophilic, and 7 thermophilic species. Multivariate analysis evidenced biotic homogenisation in 2013 and huge change in rocky reef habitats. The once flourishing algal forests have disappeared to leave space to sponges and wide areas of bare substratum. This has most probably been the result of overgrazing by alien herbivorous fishes (<i>Siganus luridus</i> and <i>S. rivulatus</i>), whose establishment and spread has been favoured by seawater warming; the synergic action of local human impacts was also evidenced."

While this pattern of biodiversity has been known to biogeographers for centuries, causal mechanisms remain enigmatic. Over the past 20 yrs, genetic markers have been employed by many researchers as a tool to elucidate patterns of biodiversity above and below the species level, as well as to make inferences about the underlying processes of diversification, demographic history, and dispersal. In a quantitative, comparative framework, these data can be synthesized to address questions about this bewildering diversity by treating species as “replicates.” However, the sheer size of the Indo-Pacific region means that the geographic and genetic scope of many species' data sets are not complementary. Here, we describe data sets from 116 Indo-Pacific species (108 studies). With a mind to future synthetic investigations, we consider the strengths and omissions of currently published population genetic data for marine fauna of the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the geographic and taxonomic scope of the data, and suggest some ways forward for data collection and collation.

Most studies attribute the onset of air-breathing to the repeated occurrence of aquatic hypoxia; however, this hypothesis leaves the current geographical distribution of the 300 genera of air-breathing crabs unexplained. Here, we show that their occurrence is mainly related to high environmental temperatures in the tropics. We also demonstrate in an amphibious crab that the reduced cost of oxygen supply in air extends aerobic performance to higher temperatures and thus widens the animal's thermal niche. These findings suggest that high water temperature as a driver consistently explains the numerous times air-breathing has evolved. The data also indicate a central role for oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance not only in shaping sensitivity to current climate change but also in underpinning the climate-dependent evolution of animals, in this case the evolution of air-breathing."

Here, we provide for the first time a benthic invertebrate survey for non-indigenous species (NIS) from the Canadian Arctic coasts, incorporating historical information to identify new records. The top three ports at highest risk for introduction of NIS of the Canadian Arctic were surveyed: Churchill (Manitoba), Deception Bay (Quebec) and Iqaluit (Nunavut). A total of 236 genera and species were identified. Based on cross referencing comparisons of contemporary and historical information on species composition and distributions, 14.4% of the taxa identified can be considered new records within the port regions surveyed and 7.2% within the more extended, adjacent surrounding regions. Increased survey effort is the most likely explanation for the majority of new occurrences, however, a small number of records (n=7) were new mentions for Canada and were categorized as cryptogenic since we could not confidently describe them as being either native or introduced. Further research is required to better understand the status of these new taxa. This study provides a benchmark for early detection for benthic invertebrates in the region. Significant costs and intensive labor are involved in monitoring and in early detection surveys, but they provide a great opportunity for identifying native and introduced biodiversity, crucial to analyzing the changes taking place along one of the longest coastlines in the world, the Canadian Arctic coast."

Monniot, 1972 is a rare species of deep-sea ascidian belonging to the Family Octacnemidae, reported at depths of 1000–2500 m in European Atlantic waters. Adult individuals have never been reported before in the Mediterranean Sea, where only seven juvenile specimens were found in 1975 at 500 m water depth in the Central basin (Malta). The affinities of these specimens with <i>D. antirrhinum</i> were noted, but lack of some typical characters of the species in juveniles prevented a definite taxonomical identification. No other member of the Octacnemidae has ever been found in the Mediterranean. In this study we describe the sampling of an adult specimen of <i>D. antirrhinum</i> at around 1100 m water depth on the flank of the La Fonera (Palamós) canyon, Northwestern Mediterranean, confirming their presence in the Mediterranean Sea. We also observed 5 individuals of this species on their natural habitat with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Our results highlight the potential occurrence of Octacnemidae, the presence of which has been largely overlooked, in several deep-sea canyon areas within the Western Mediterranean basin. These observations are important because they indicate the need for increased sampling effort with new technologies, such as ROVs, in ecologically relevant habitats such as canyons, in order to obtain a more accurate picture of deep-sea biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea."

Fishery management measures in this area include a trawling period of 8?months per year (October to May). Macrofauna samples were collected before and after 30 and 120?days of the commencement of the trawling period (temporal axis) along a southward transect (spatial axis) and down through the sediment profile (vertical axis).ResultsMain results revealed no recognizable changes in community diversity and structure at temporal scales. This finding can probably be attributed to the fact that the examined communities are subjected to continuous disturbances deriving from multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors acting simultaneously in Thermaikos Gulf. Molluscan assemblages were already stressed before the commencement of the trawling period, indicating that the time period in which bottom trawling is prohibited is not sufficient for the recovery of benthic communities. Significant shifts in the trophic structure of molluscan assemblages were also detected. The direct mortality of herbivorous species and the loss of filter feeding organisms may be attributed to the passage of the fishing gear and to sediment re-suspension, respectively. Trawling disturbance may have created the observed vertical patterns of the community structure since hauling induces profound changes in the geochemical profile of the sediment.ConclusionsOur findings sustained the notion that bottom trawling, alongside with other types of human induced stressors, can have considerable effects on the structure and function of the benthic domain. Therefore, our results highlighted the need of an Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) perspective in Thermaikos Gulf to ensure both fisheries and ecosystem sustainability."

The current project studied for the first time how megabenthic community structure is related to several environmental factors over 2000 km of the Canadian Arctic, from the Beaufort Sea to northern Baffin Bay. Faunal trawl samples were collected between 2007 and 2011 at 78 stations from 30 to 1000 m depth and patterns in biomass, density, richness, diversity, and taxonomic composition were examined in relation to indirect/spatial gradients (e.g., depth), direct gradients (e.g., bottom oceanographic variables), and resource gradients (e.g., food supply proxies). Six benthic community types were defined based on their biomass-based taxonomic composition. Their distribution was significantly, but moderately, associated with large-scale (100–1000 km) environmental gradients defined by depth, physical water properties (e.g., bottom salinity), and meso-scale (10–100 km) environmental gradients defined by substrate type (hard vs. soft) and sediment organic carbon content. We did not observe a strong decline of bulk biomass, density and richness with depth or a strong increase of those community characteristics with food supply proxies, contrary to our hypothesis. We discuss how local- to meso-scale environmental conditions, such as bottom current regimes and polynyas, sustain biomass-rich communities at specific locations in oligotrophic and in deep regions of the Canadian Arctic.

The marine isopod <i>Idotea baltica</i> is notably dominant among the shallow sublittoral of the Baltic Sea in association with <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>, with permanent populations documented in salinities as low as 3 psu. To investigate the role of physiological plasticity in the successful colonisation of the Baltic by <i>I. baltica</i> three populations from the Swedish coast were here studied, one from the Kattegat (Malmö) and two from the Baltic Sea (Kalmar and Öregrund). These three sites cover the geographic range of this species within the Baltic Sea on the Swedish coast, and also the salinity range of this species within the Baltic Sea (10–5 psu). Individuals from these populations were exposed in the laboratory to a fully crossed experiment with the factors salinity and food source, to test for differences in the physiology of these populations under different conditions that may indicate local adaptation, or no differences that indicate physiological plasticity to differing salinity and food source. Metabolic rate, growth and thermal tolerance responses did not differ between the three populations across salinity treatments after a 12 week exposure. The results of this study indicate that the physiology of adult <i>I. baltica</i> is highly plastic with regard to salinity; this plasticity is likely to have facilitated their colonisation of the Baltic Sea."

Until recently, <i>T. noae</i> was considered conspecific with <i>T. maxima</i>. However, in this study, among the four genes (COI, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA) examined, two (i.e., 16S rRNA and COI) genes grouped <i>T. maxima</i> into two distinct clades, suggesting that a cryptic species was involved. The genetic distance of the 16S rRNA gene between <i>T. maxima</i> and cryptic species was 0.042–0.048. In contrast, the differences within the clades comprising <i>T. maxima</i> and the cryptic species were 0–0.003 and 0–0.005, respectively. A careful comparison of morphological traits revealed differences between T. maxima and the cryptic species, and the shells of the latter species were consistent with the figures referred to by Röding for the species he named ‘<i>noae</i>’. <i>Tridacna noae</i> differs from <i>T. maxima</i> in the appearance and arrangement of hyaline organs on the mantle in living specimens.

Examination of labels and contents of Chinese seafood products imported to Italy found that 83% did not meet EU requirements for traceability. Overall, this survey put into light the difficulties of the ethnic communities to conform to the European rules, the need to adapt the control system to the fast developing trade reality at all levels of the chain and the advisability to create standards that could be adopted worldwide."

287672	2014	AS	Next-generation environmental diversity surveys of Foraminifera: preparing the future	"Foraminifera are commonly defined as marine testate protists, and their diversity is mainly assessed on the basis of the morphology of their agglutinated or mineralized tests. Diversity surveys based on environmental DNA (eDNA) have dramatically changed this view by revealing an unexpected diversity of naked and organic-walled lineages as well as detecting foraminiferal lineages in soil and freshwater environments. Moreover, single-cell analyses have allowed discrimination among genetically distinctive types within almost every described morphospecies. In view of these studies, the foraminiferal diversity appeared to be largely underestimated, but its accurate estimation was impeded by the low speed and coverage of a cloning-based eDNA approach. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, these limitations disappeared in favor of exhaustive descriptions of foraminiferal diversity in numerous samples. Yet, the biases and errors identified in early HTS studies raised some questions about the accuracy of HTS data and their biological interpretation. Among the most controversial issues affecting the reliability of HTS diversity estimates are (1) the impact of technical and biological biases, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic sequence assignment, (3) the ability to distinguish rare species, and (4) the quantitative interpretation of HTS data. Here, we document the lessons learned from previous HTS surveys and present the current advances and applications focusing on foraminiferal eDNA. We discuss the problems associated with HTS approaches and predict the future trends and avenues that hold promises for surveying foraminiferal diversity accurately and efficiently."

Paradoxically, despite their relevance and extensive study for over 150 years, their evolutionary relationships are still unresolved. Classical morphological systematics was often based on non-cladistic approaches, while modern phylogenetic studies suffer from severe undersampling of taxa and characters (both molecular and morphological). Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of the familial relationships within the Balanomorpha. We estimate divergence times and examine morphological diversity based on five genes, 156 specimens, 10 fossil calibrations, and six key morphological characters. Two balanomorphan superfamilies, eight families and twelve genera were identified as polyphyletic. Chthamaloids, chionelasmatoid and pachylasmatoids split first from the pedunculated ancestors followed by a clade of tetraclitoids and coronuloids, and most of the balanoids. The Balanomorpha split from the Verrucidae (outgroup) in the Lower Cretaceous (139.6 Mya) with all the main lineages, except Pachylasmatoidea, having emerged by the Paleocene (60.9 Mya). Various degrees of convergence were observed in all the assessed morphological characters except the maxillipeds, which suggests that classical interpretations of balanomorphan morphological evolution need to be revised and reinterpreted."

At this location, a highly expanded (8.5 m thick) stratigraphic succession, unconformably overlying Middle Pleistocene marine clay deposits, provides evidence for sea-level fluctuations during the Last Interglacial. An integrated study of Fronte Section, including facies analysis, detailed macrofaunal and meiofaunal characterization, and sequence stratigraphy, is presented. The occurrence of <i>Persististrombus latus</i> (= <i>Strombus bubonius</i>) and other warm-water indicators (“<i>Senegalaise</i>” – “<i>Senegalian</i>” – guests of Gignoux, 1913), together with the presence of the dinocyst <i>Polysphaeridium zoharyi</i> and ten U-series dates on <i>Cladocora caespitosa</i> samples, permit an unequivocal MIS 5e age assignment to the upper part of the study succession. Above a stratigraphic unconformity marked by the boring coastal-lagoonal bivalve <i>Pholas dactylus</i>, the MIS 5e succession displays a first transgressive suite of brackish to shallow-marine deposits. These latter include highly fossiliferous muds rich in <i>C. caespitosa</i>, overlain by a fossil-rich calcarenite, 2 m-thick, yielding warm-water “Senegalian” mollusks. Above this prominent stratigraphic marker (regionally called <i>panchina</i>), which is interpreted to represent a short-lived phase of sea-level stillstand or gentle fall during MIS 5e, renewed transgression took place, leading to the accumulation of middle-outer shelf muds, about 5 m thick. The maximum flooding zone is clearly identified on the basis of the turnaround from a deepening-up to a shallowing-up trend. The upper part of Fronte Section records a second fossil-rich, sublittoral calcarenite containing warm-water mollusks, which is interpreted to reflect the subsequent phase of sea-level highstand, likely correlative with the MIS 5e plateau."

With the help of mitochondrial DNA, two novel species of <i>Crassostrea</i> oysters (<i>C. hongkongensis</i> and <i>C. zhanjiangensis</i>) were recently recognized, which suggests that the species diversity of Indo-Pacific oysters could be underestimated. Utilizing a combination of shell characteristics, a molecular marker (mitochondrial <i>cox1</i> gene) and phylogenetic analysis, we identified a mangrove-distributed novel <i>Crassostrea</i> oyster species, <i>C. dianbaiensis</i>. The shell morphology of the new species is phenoplastic, as seen in other congeneric oysters. The left valve of this oyster is usually deeply cupped, and the right valve is usually slightly concave. The body size is classified as medium and is approximately 5–10 cm in height (estimated from 20 individuals). One distinctive feature of <i>C. dianbaiensis</i> is that the adductor muscle scars vary in color from dark purple to white in the right valve, but always appear white in the left valve. Based on the <i>cox1</i> phylogenetic tree, <i>C. dianbaiensis</i> is inferred to be a new member of the Southeast Asia tropical oysters and is believed to be the northernmost distributed species among the tropical oysters. This study provided basal information for future studies, which are necessary to better understand the faunal characteristics, population and roles of this oyster in nearshore ecosystems."

To determine whether benthic epifaunal and infaunal assemblage patterns vary by the identity of dominant seagrass species in shallow water meadows, we compared quantitative measures of faunal species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure among beds dominated by <i>Cymodocea rotundata, Enhalus acoroides</i>, and <i>Thalassia hemprichii</i>; the study site was at Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental Province in the southern Philippines. The <i>Cymodocea</i>-dominated vegetation had higher seagrass shoot density and lower seagrass biomass than those dominated by <i>Enhalus</i> and <i>Thalassia</i>. Across vegetation types, we encountered 30 and 15 species of epifauna and infauna at average densities of 1.73 and 0.82 animals/core (0.0314 m<sup>2</sup>), respectively. Neither densities and species richnesses of epifauna and infauna nor species composition varied significantly by vegetation type. Multivariate analyses of macrofaunal assemblage structure and abiotic/biotic environmental factors demonstrated that seagrass aboveground biomass explained a significant proportion of the multivariate variation in epifaunal species composition (39%); none of the potential explanatory variables was related to variation in ecological parameters of the infauna. Thus, seagrass specific identity is not a good predictor of either macrofaunal abundance or diversity patterns. Although the ecological parameters of the benthic macrofauna may be influenced by seagrass biomass and structure, responses differ between epifauna and infauna."	"Leopardas, V.; Uy, W.; Nakaoka, M."

Data for biological (epibenthic species composition, abundance, and biomass) and environmental (bottom water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH, sediment grain size, sediment organic matter and sediment chlorophyll content, latitude, longitude, and water depth) variables were collected at 53 stations in the northeastern Chukchi Sea during the summers of 2009–2010 to characterize the epibenthos and provide a benchmark for potential future changes due to possible anthropogenic disturbances. Community biomass, abundance, species composition and taxa richness varied in patches throughout the study area, but were generally dominated by crustaceans and echinoderms. These two groups had an inverse relationship in the distribution of their dominance.

This has changed only recently, at the end of 2011, with the onset of a new wet phase that has already caused a major shift to oligo- and mesohaline conditions. The estuary mouth, however, remains closed to the ocean, making the weak connection recently established between the St Lucia and the Mfolozi estuaries the only conveyance for marine recruitment. As a result, only 10 indigenous and two alien aquatic gastropod species are currently found living in the St Lucia estuarine lake. This is out of a total of 37 species recorded within the system since the earliest survey undertaken in 1924, half of which have not been reported in the literature before. The tick shell, <i>Nassarius kraussianus</i>, which was consistently found in large abundance prior to the recent dry phase, appears to have temporarily disappeared from the system, probably as a result of the extinction of <i>Zostera</i> marine grasses inside the lake. Population explosions of the bubble shell <i>Haminoea natalensis</i>, with its distinct egg masses, were recorded seasonally until 2009, but the species has subsequently not been observed again.

However, the trade has also been implicated as having potentially widespread environmental impacts that has in part driven developments in aquaculture to relieve wild collection pressures. This study investigates the biodiversity in hobbyist aquaria (using an online survey) and those species currently available from an aquaculture source (commercial data and hobbyist initiatives) in the context of a traffic light system to highlight gaps in aquaculture effort and identify groups that require fisheries assessments. Two hundred and sixty nine species including clown fish, damsels, dotty backs, angelfish, gobies, sea horses and blennies, have reported breeding successes by hobbyists, a pattern mirrored by the European and US commercial organisations. However, there is a mismatch (high demand and low/non-existent aquaculture) for a number of groups including tangs, starfish, anemones and hermit crabs, which we recommend are priority candidates for local stock assessments. Hobbyist perception towards the concept of a sustainable aquarium trade is also explored with results demonstrating that only 40% of respondents were in agreement with industry and scientists who believe the trade could be an exemplar of a sustainable use of coral reefs. We believe that a more transparent evidence base, including the publication of the species collected and cultured, will go some way to align the concept of a sustainable trade across industry stakeholders and better inform the hobbyist when purchasing their aquaria stock. We conclude by proposing that a certification scheme established with government support is the most effective way to move towards a self-regulating industry. It would prevent industry “greenwashing” from multiple certification schemes, alleviate conservation concerns, and, ultimately, support aquaculture initiatives alongside well managed ornamental fisheries."

This ecosystem was catastrophically impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as the 600 year-old tsunami in Phra Thong island, Phang Nga province. No study has been conducted to elucidate their effects on microbial ecology. This study represents the first to elucidate their effects on microbial ecology. We utilized metagenomics with 16S and 18S rDNA-barcoded pyrosequencing to obtain prokaryotic and eukaryotic profiles for this terrestrial site, tsunami affected (S1), as well as a parallel unaffected terrestrial site, non-tsunami affected (S2). S1 demonstrated unique microbial community patterns than S2. The dendrogram constructed using the prokaryotic profiles supported the unique S1 microbial communities. S1 contained more proportions of archaea and bacteria domains, specifically species belonging to Bacteroidetes became more frequent, in replacing of the other typical floras like Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Basidiomycota. Pathogenic microbes, including <i>Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Flavobacterium</i> spp. and <i>Photobacterium</i> spp., were also found frequently in S1. Furthermore, different metabolic potentials highlighted this microbial community change could impact the functional ecology of the site. Moreover, the habitat prediction based on percent of species indicators for marine, brackish, freshwater and terrestrial niches pointed the S1 to largely comprise marine habitat indicating-species."

In this study we collated occurrence data obtained from field surveys, spanning over a period of 10 years, and from an extensive literature review. We aimed to determine which wood-boring limnoriid species are established in European coastal waters; to map their past and recent distribution in Europe in order to infer species range extension or contraction; to determine species environmental requirements using climatic envelopes. Of the six species of wood-boring <i>Limnoria</i> previously reported occurring in Europe, only <i>Limnoria lignorum, L. quadripunctata</i> and <i>L. tripunctata</i> are established in European coastal waters. <i>L. carinata</i> and <i>L. tuberculate</i> have uncertain established status, whereas <i>L. borealis</i> is not established in European waters. The species with the widest distribution in Europe is <i>Limnoria lignorum</i>, which is also the most tolerant species to a range of salinities. <i>L. quadripunctata</i> and <i>L. tripunctata</i> appear to be stenohaline. However, the present study shows that both<i> L. quadripunctata</i> and <i>L. tripunctata</i> are more widespread in Europe than previous reports suggested. Both species have been found occurring in Europe since they were described, and their increased distribution is probably the results of a range expansion. On the other hand <i>L. lignorum</i> appears to be retreating poleward with ocean warming. In certain areas (e.g. southern England, and southern Portugal), limnoriids appear to be very abundant and their activity is rivalling that of teredinids. Therefore, it is important to monitor the distribution and destructive activity of these organisms in Europe."	"Borges, L.M.S.; Merckelbach, L.M.; Cragg, S.M."	WOS:000343662500058

A total of 145 species were recorded with clear dominance of Bacillariophyceae, which formed about 76.4% of the total phytoplankton counts with annual average of 3654 cell/L and Dinophyceae (14.63%) with annual average of 700 cell/L. Other algal classes; like Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Silicoflagellates sustained low counts, forming collectively about 9.0% of the total abundance of phytoplankton. Autumn was the most productive season recording an average of 5916 unit/L, followed by spring (average of 5282 unit/L) and winter (average of 4329 unit/L), while summer showed the lowest counts (average of 3607 unit/L). The species diversity fluctuated between 3.36 in the summer and 3.97 in autumn, with an annual average of 3.76.

The physico-chemical properties of surface water exhibited seasonal and spatial variations. The dissolved nitrate (0.07–2.27 ?M), ammonium (1.82–8.80 ?M), reactive silicate (0.41–5.22 ?M) and water salinity (39.9–42.9‰) were the most effective factors that controlled the seasonal fluctuations of phytoplankton during 2013.

Because coral health and survival largely depend on the interaction between a coral host and its symbionts, it is important to understand the molecular interactions of an entire “coral holobiont”. We simultaneously sequenced transcriptomes of <i>Porites australiensis</i> and its symbionts using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. We obtained 14.3 Gbp of sequencing data and assembled it into 74,997 contigs (average: 1,263 bp, N50 size: 2,037 bp). We successfully distinguished contigs originating from the host (<i>Porites</i>) and the symbiont (<i>Symbiodinium</i>) by aligning nucleotide sequences with the decoded <i>Acropora digitifera</i> and <i>Symbiodinium minutum</i> genomes. In contrast to previous coral transcriptome studies, at least 35% of the sequences were found to have originated from the symbionts, indicating that it is possible to analyze both host and symbiont transcriptomes simultaneously. Conserved protein domain and KEGG analyses showed that the dataset contains broad gene repertoires of both <i>Porites</i> and <i>Symbiodinium</i>. Effective utilization of sequence reads revealed that the polymorphism rate in <i>P. australiensis</i> is 1.0% and identified the major symbiotic <i>Symbiodinium</i> as Type C15. Analyses of amino acid biosynthetic pathways suggested that this <i>Porites</i> holobiont is probably able to synthesize most of the common amino acids and that <i>Symbiodinium</i> is potentially able to provide essential amino acids to its host. We believe this to be the first molecular evidence of complementarity in amino acid metabolism between coral hosts and their symbionts. We successfully assembled genes originating from both the host coral and the symbiotic <i>Symbiodinium</i> to create a snapshot of the coral holobiont transcriptome. This dataset will facilitate a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms of coral symbioses and stress responses."	"Shinzato, C.; Inoue, M.; Kusakabe, M."	WOS:000330235100062

"Spatial variation in the components of faunal assemblages, but spatial uniformity of their biodiversity metrics, as described in 2013 for a seagrass bed in an estuarine bay in the warm-temperate Indian Ocean, is probably widespread in marine environments, and not restricted to seagrass habitats. Here, it is shown to occur across unvegetated siliceous sandflats as well as seagrass beds on a high-diversity but low-abundance subtropical island (North Stradbroke Island, Australia) in the South Pacific, and on a low-diversity but high-abundance cool-temperate island (Scolt Head Island, UK) in the North Atlantic. At the Australian locality, this uniform biodiversity but non-uniform faunal assemblage composistion were observed to extend over distances of at least 6.5 km in both habitat types. Unit areas as small as 0.0275 m<sup>2</sup> in each system supported a statistically invariant percentage of the total species pool of that system (i.e. the system’s overall mean percentage constancy index at the spatial scale concerned). Further, assemblages in all localities showed very similar ranked species-constancy curves, even though the proportions of the total numbers comprised by the various species varied widely. It is therefore suggested that the factors structuring the macrofaunal assemblages in such soft-sediment habitats must be capable of promoting comparable systems of relative frequency of occurrence, regardless of local levels of faunal abundance and biodiversity."

Material was collected mainly from sediments, algae and hydroids along the whole coast of the Iberian Peninsula from 1989 to 2011. Although detritus was the dominant food item in the majority of amphipods, gammarideans also included carnivorous (mainly feeding on crustaceans) and herbivorous species (feeding on macroalgal tissues). Our study revealed that general assignment of a type of diet for a whole family is not always adequate. Some families showed a consistent pattern in most of the studied species (Corophiidae, Pontoporeiidae = detritivorous; Oedicerotidae, Phoxocephalidae, Stenothoidae = carnivorous; Ampithoidae = primarily herbivorous on macroalgae), but others included species with totally different feeding strategies. In general terms, detritivorous families were characterized by a stronger mandibular molar, while in carnivorous taxa this feature was less developed or reduced. The percentage of macroalgae in the digestive contents was associated in most cases with a reduction or loss of the mandibular palp. It seems that high trophic diversity in amphipods is a generalized trait along different ecosystems in all latitudes, and could be related to the ecological success of this group in marine benthic communities."

Adult <i>G. viverratus</i> were collected between August 2012 and July 2013 in São Vicente Island (Republic of Cabo Verde), at pristine sites on the northeastern and eastern coasts and at Porto Grande Bay, the major harbour in the country. All the females (n = 81) caught outside the bay were normal, but 99% (n = 108) of those collected inside the bay exhibited degrees of abnormal virilization. Seven levels of imposex intensity, from stage 0 (normal) to stage 6 (sterilized females), are described following at least three different pathways of evolution (a, b and c). Female sterilization was caused mainly by abnormal growth of ‘tumour-like’ tissues in the oviduct. A peculiar characteristic of imposex in this species is the development of a distal prostate by females, resembling the same organ exhibited by males. In the laboratory, imposex could be artificially induced by injecting very small doses of TBT into females, demonstrating that TBT is a causative agent of this syndrome."

The Dumre plateau, in Central Albania, is characterized by an extraordinary high number of karst lakes in a small geographic area. Despite their environmental peculiarity, very few biological data are to date available for these lakes, none on the zooplankton. For this reason, 15 water bodies located in the central area of the plateau were selected for a preliminary limnological survey carried out in the years 2008-2011. <i>Neodiaptomus schmackeri</i> (Poppe & Richard, 1892), a diaptomid calanoid copepod characterized by a South-Eastern Palearctic - Oriental distribution, and the most widely spread <i>Neodiaptomus</i> species in Asia, was found in 8 lakes of the Dumre area. This finding represents the first record of the species, and of the entire genus <i>Neodiaptomus</i>, for Europe. Several environmental variables were measured to characterize the lakes, and the co-occurring planktonic crustaceans were also identified. Taxonomical drawings and descriptions of the main morphological features of both sexes are herein provided in order to compare the Albanian populations of <i>N. schmackeri</i> with those of the native distribution area of the species.

The study is based on samples collected from four lakes across Estonia and from three sandy beaches on the Estonian coast of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, in 2008-2014. Animals from 12 phyla were found, of which the majority of rotifers and testate amoebae were identified to species level. A total of 156 taxa were determined, including 84 rotifer species and 39 testate amoebae species. In addition to the 46 new taxa for the Estonian fauna already registered in our previous works, the present study reports further 11 new rotifer, 19 testate amoebae, and 6 nematode taxa. The psammic communities in lake beaches had higher species richness than in coastal beaches, and the communities were more similar in coastal beaches than in lake beaches. The mesotrophic Lake Saadjärv had the highest taxon richness with 80 taxa from 10 phyla. Similarly, the number of testate amoebae species was higher in lake beaches than in coastal beaches. The number of taxa, especially the number of rotifer species, was lower in sampling sites with an elevated trophic state and/or human population density.

The habitat engineered by this species was sampled and compared with the adjacent uncolonized <i>Amphiura filiformis</i> muddy habitat in winter and summer. The isotopic signatures of macrofaunal and megafaunal species associated with both habitats were analysed along with potential food sources at each sampling period. Similar food web structures for each habitat (and each season), with high ?<sup>15</sup>N ranges spanning over 3 trophic levels, were reported although omnivory was less frequent in the <i>H. nirae</i> habitat. The amphipod <i>H. nirae</i> appears to play a baseline role, with the lowest ?<sup>15</sup>N values and ?<sup>13</sup>C values indicating that it primarily feeds on phytoplankton. Bayesian mixing models were used to estimate the contributions of potential food sources to the diet of the species accounting for most of the biomass in each habitat and showed that the epibionts covering tube mats are a key contribution to the food webs of both habitats. Identified as benthic diatoms, they may minimize interspecific food competition between dominant suspension feeders such as <i>Polititapes virgineus</i> or <i>H. nirae</i> within a habitat. This finding highlights the contribution of microphytobenthic producers to subtidal (~30 m deep) muddy habitat food webs, suggesting that the mucopolysaccharides composing the <i>H. nirae</i> tubes support the growth of a heterotrophic diatom population. As an engineer species, <i>H. nirae</i> acts as a facilitator for diatoms which ultimately sustain the secondary production of the <i>H. nirae</i> habitat as well as the immediate surrounding habitats."

Phylogenetic results showed sequences from all specimens for all markers formed one monophyly, and morphological results showed little differentiation between the two putative taxa.

Understanding the ecosystem consequences of these changes is critical to effectively managing these systems. Over the last several years, numerous experimental manipulations of species richness have been performed, yet existing quantitative syntheses have focused on a just a subset of processes measured in experiments and, as such, have not summarized the full data available from marine systems. Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 110 marine experiments from 42 studies that manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes).

Our results show that, generally, mixtures of species tend to enhance levels of ecosystem function relative to the average component species in monoculture, but have no effect or a negative effect on functioning relative to the ‘highest- performing’ species. These results are largely consistent with those from other syntheses, and extend conclusions to ecological functions that are commonly measured in the marine realm (e.g. nutrient release from sediment bioturbation). For experiments that manipulated three or more levels of richness, we attempted to discern the functional form of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. We found that, for response variables related to consumption, a power-function best described the relationship, which is also consistent with previous findings. However, we identified a linear relationship between richness and production. Combined, our results suggest that changes in the number of species will, on average, tend to alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We outline several research frontiers that will allow us to more fully understand how, why, and when diversity may drive the functioning of marine ecosystems."

It is the responsibility of protistologists to build such nodes for their own discipline."	"Patterson, D.J."	WOS:000332608800011

282294	2014	AS	Multiscale patterns in the diversity and organization of benthic intertidal fauna among French Atlantic estuaries	"Based on a parallel sampling conducted during autumn 2008, a comparative study of the intertidal benthic macrofauna among 10 estuarine systems located along the Channel and Atlantic coasts of France was performed in order to assess the level of fauna similarity among these sites and to identify possible environmental factors involved in the observed pattern at both large (among sites) and smaller (benthic assemblages) scales. More precisely this study focused on unraveling the observed pattern of intertidal benthic fauna composition and diversity observed at among-site scale by exploring both biotic and abiotic factors acting at the among- and within-site scales. Results showed a limited level of similarity at the among-site level in terms of intertidal benthic fauna composition and diversity. The observed pattern did not fit with existing transitional water classification methods based on fish or benthic assemblages developed in the frame of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). More particularly, the coastal plain estuaries displayed higher among-site similarity compared to ria systems. These coastal plain estuaries were characterized by higher influence of river discharge, lower communication with the ocean and high suspended particulate matter levels. On the other hand, the ria-type systems were more dissimilar and different from the coastal plain estuaries. The level of similarity among estuaries was mainly linked to the relative extent of the intertidal “<i>Scrobicularia plana–Cerastoderma edule</i>” and “<i>Tellina tenuis</i>” or “<i>Venus</i>” communities as a possible consequence of salinity regime, suspended matter concentrations and fine particles supply with consequences on the trophic functioning, structure and organization of benthic fauna. Despite biogeographical patterns, the results also suggest that, in the context of the WFD, these estuaries should only be compared on the basis of the most common intertidal habitat occurring throughout all estuarine systems and that the EUNIS biotope classification might be used for this purpose. In addition, an original inverse relation between ?-diversity and area was shown; however, its relevance might be questioned."

282494	2014	AS	"Diversity, environmental requirements, and biogeography of bivalve wood-borers (Teredinidae) in European coastal waters"	"Background: Bivalve teredinids inflict great destruction to wooden maritime structures. Yet no comprehensive study was ever carried out on these organisms in European coastal waters. Thus, the aims of this study were to: investigate the diversity of teredinids in European coastal waters; map their past and recent distributions to detect range expansion or contraction; determine salinity-temperature (S-T) requirements of species; flag, for future monitoring, the species that pose the greatest hazard for wooden structures. Results: A total of nine teredinid species were found established in European coastal waters. Seven were considered cryptogenic, of unknown origin, and two were considered alien species. Teredo navalis and Nototeredo norvagica were the species with the widest distribution in European waters. Recently, T. navalis has been reported occurring further east in the Baltic Sea but it was not found at a number of sites on the Atlantic coast of southern Europe. The Atlantic lineage of Lyrodus pedicellatus was the dominant teredinid in the southern Atlantic coast of Europe. In the Mediterranean six teredinid species occurred in sympatry, whereas only three of these occurred in the Black Sea. The species that pose the greatest hazard to wooden maritime structures in European coastal areas are T. navalis and the two lineages of L. pedicellatus. Conclusions: Combined data from field surveys and from the literature made it possible to determine the diversity of established teredinid species and their past and recent distribution in Europe. The environmental requirements of species, determined using climatic envelopes, produced valuable information that assisted on the explanation of species distribution. In addition, the observed trends of species range extension or contraction in Teredo navalis and in the two lineages of Lyrodus pedicellatus seem to emphasise the importance of temperature and salinity as determinants of the distribution of teredinids, whereas their life history strategy seems to play an important role on competition. Teredo navalis and pedicellatus-like Lyrodus species should be monitored due to their destructive capability. The two alien species may expand further their distribution range in Europe, becoming invasive, and should also be monitored."	"Borges, L.M.S.; Merckelbach, L.M.; Sampaio, I.; Cragg, S.M."

317990	2014	M	The analysis of open source software and data for establishment of GIS services throughout the network in a mapping organization at national or international level	"Federal agencies and their partners collect and manage large amounts of geospatial data but it is often not easily found when needed, and sometimes data is collected or purchased multiple times. In short, the best government data is not always organized and managed efficiently to support decision making in a timely and cost effective manner.
National mapping agencies, various Departments responsible for collection of different types of Geospatial data and their authorities cannot, for very long, continue to operate, as they did a few years ago like people living in an island. Leaders need to look at what is now possible that was not possible before, considering capabilities such as cloud computing, crowd sourced data collection, available Open source remotely sensed data and multi source information vital in decision-making as well as new Web-accessible services that provide, sometimes at no cost. Many of these services previously could be obtained only from local GIS experts. These authorities need to consider the available solution and gather information about new capabilities, reconsider agency missions and goals, review and revise policies, make budget and human resource for decisions, and evaluate new products, cloud services, and cloud service providers.
To do so, we need, choosing the right tools to rich the above-mentioned goals. As we know, Data collection is the most cost effective part of the mapping and establishment of a Geographic Information system. However, it is not only because of the cost for the data collection task but also because of the damages caused by the delay and the time that takes to provide the user with proper information necessary for making decision from the field up to the user’s hand. In fact, the time consumption of a project for data collection, processing, and presentation of geospatial information has more effect on the cost of a bigger project such as disaster management, construction, city planning, environment, etc. Of course, with such a pre-assumption that we provide all the necessary information from the existing sources directed to user’s computer.
The best description for a good GIS project optimization or improvement is finding a methodology to reduce the time and cost, and increase data and service quality (meaning; Accuracy, updateness, completeness, consistency, suitability, information content, integrity, integration capability, and fitness for use as well as user’s specific needs and conditions that must be addressed with a special attention).
Every one of the above-mentioned issues must be addressed individually and at the same time, the whole solution must be provided in a global manner considering all the criteria.
In this thesis at first, we will discuss about the problem we are facing and what is needed to be done as establishment of National Spatial Data Infra-Structure (NSDI), the definition and related components. Then after, we will be looking for available Open Source Software solutions to cover the whole process to manage; Data collection, Data base management system, data processing and finally data services and presentation. The first distinction among Software is whether they are, Open source and free or commercial and proprietary. It is important to note that in order to make distinction among softwares it is necessary to define a clear specification for this categorization. It is somehow very difficult to distinguish what software belongs to which class from legal point of view and therefore, makes it necessary to clarify what is meant by various terms. With reference to this concept there are 2 global distinctions then, inside each group, we distinguish another classification regarding their functionalities and applications they are made for in GIScience.
According to the outcome of the second chapter, which is the technical process for selection of suitable and reliable software according to the characteristics of the users need and required components, we will come to next chapter. In chapter 3, we elaborate in to the details of the GeoNode software as our best candidate tools to take responsibilities of those issues stated before.
In Chapter 4, we will discuss the existing Open Source Data globally available with the predefined data quality criteria (Such as theme, data content, scale, licensing, and coverage) according to the metadata statement inside the datasets by mean of bibliographic review, technical documentation and web search engines. We will discuss in chapter 5 further data quality concepts and consequently define sets of protocol for evaluation of all datasets according to the tasks that a mapping organization in general, needed to be responsible to the probable users in different disciplines such as; Reconnaissance, City Planning, Topographic mapping, Transportation, Environment control, disaster management and etc…
In Chapter 6, all the data quality assessment and protocols will be implemented into the pre-filtered, proposed datasets. In the final scores and ranking result, each datasets will have a value corresponding to their quality according to the sets of rules that are defined in previous chapter.
In last steps, there will be a vector of weight that is derived from the questions that has to be answered by user with reference to the project in hand in order to finalize the most appropriate selection of Free and Open Source Data. This Data quality preference has to be defined by identifying a set of weight vector, and then they have to be applied to the quality matrix in order to get a final quality scores and ranking. At the end of this chapter there will be a section presenting data sets utilization in various projects such as “ Early Impact Analysis” as well as “Extreme Rainfall Detection System (ERDS)- version 2” performed by ITHACA.
Finally, in conclusion, the important criteria, as well as future trend in GIS software are discussed and at the end recommendations will be presented."	"Jafari Salim, M."	\N

312888	2014	AS	The role of the sedimentary regime in shaping the distribution of subtidal sandbank environments and the associated meiofaunal nematode communities: an example from the southern North Sea	"We combined sediment and faunal data to explore the role of the sedimentary regime in shaping the distribution of subtidal sandbank environments and the associated meiofaunal nematode communities at Broken Bank and Swarte Bank, in the southern North Sea. A variety of sediment transport processes occur in the area, differing in the frequency and magnitude of sediment mobility, and the continuum between erosion, translation and sediment accumulation. The seabed contained a variety of bedforms, including longitudinal furrows, and small to very large sandwaves. The bed sediments were dominated by fine and medium sands, with admixtures of silt and gravel. Based on sedimentary bedforms and grain size analysis, a total of 11 sedimentary facies were delineated, of which 8 were analysed in detail for their relationships with the meiofauna. The sedimentary facies fell clearly into groups of facies, respectively representing high, high-moderate and moderate, and episodic sediment mobility. For those sedimentary facies where daily movement of sediments and bedforms occurred (‘high’ sediment mobility), the resulting spatially homogeneous environments were dominated by an impoverished nematode community comprising small deposit feeders and large predators. Resistance to sediment movement and the ability to exploit alternative food sources were prominent functional features of the successful colonisers. Those facies characterised by relatively infrequent sediment mobility (‘episodic’ and ‘high-moderate and moderate’ sediment mobility) comprised a heterogeneous suite of benthic habitats, containing taxonomically and functionally diverse assemblages of nematodes of various sizes, feeding types and reproductive potential. Faunal distribution patterns here indicated trade-offs between the resistance to sediment movement, environmental tolerance and competitive abilities. Our focus on diverse assemblages of organisms with high turnover times, inhabiting highly dynamic sedimentary environments, has revealed new animal-sediment relationships of relevance to pure and applied science."

This study presents an analysis of the nature of the problem from first principles, reviews some available algorithmic approaches, and describes Taxamatch, an improved name matching solution for this information domain. Taxamatch employs a custom Modified Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm in tandem with a phonetic algorithm, together with a rule-based approach incorporating a suite of heuristic filters, to produce improved levels of recall, precision and execution time over the existing dynamic programming algorithms n-grams (as bigrams and trigrams) and standard edit distance. Although entirely phonetic methods are faster than Taxamatch, they are inferior in the area of recall since many real-world errors are non-phonetic in nature. Excellent performance of Taxamatch (as recall, precision and execution time) is demonstrated against a reference database of over 465,000 genus names and 1.6 million species names, as well as against a range of error types as present at both genus and species levels in three sets of sample data for species and four for genera alone. An ancillary authority matching component is included which can be used both for misspelled names and for otherwise matching names where the associated cited authorities are not identical."

312795	2014	AS	Taxonomic resolution and Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) approaches in estuarine free-living nematodes	"The taxonomic and functional structure of the subtidal nematode assemblages from a temperate estuary (Mondego estuary, Portugal) was studied, focussing on different taxonomic levels (genus, family and order), on single functional groups and on multiple biological traits. Based on taxonomic levels and on four biological traits (feeding type, life strategy, tail and body shape), the analysis of the nematode assemblage distribution patterns revealed spatial differences but no clear temporal pattern. At the family and genus level, a separation of the upstream sections was observed, while a distinction of polyhaline and euhaline areas was less evident. The use of biological traits added new information regarding the relationships between diversity patterns and the environmental variables. Most nematodes encountered along the estuary were non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and omnivores/predators (2B), colonizer–persisters (score of 2 or 3), with clavate-conicocylindrical tails and slender bodies and with a distribution related essentially to salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a. Applying a Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) showed the role of oxygen concentration in the distribution of the nematode communities. Although the BTA was no more powerful than the traditional taxonomic approach in detecting spatial differences along the Mondego estuary, it has increased our knowledge of the functional structure and characterization of nematode communities in the estuary."

However, meiofauna have only recently been included in studies of those environments and detailed information on these communities is still rare. This is especially true in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, even though there are many seamounts with active vents in the calderas of the region. Nematode community composition at the genus level in sediments from a hydrothermal vent field in the caldera of Myojin Knoll (32°06?N, 139°52?E, depth 1,300&nbsp;m), a seamount on the Izu-Ogasawara Arc, Japan, was investigated for the first time and was compared with adjacent non-vent areas inside and outside the caldera. Multivariate analyses showed that the composition of nematodes in the hydrothermal field was significantly different from that in the non-hydrothermal fields around the caldera. However, the common genera, such as <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Oxystomina</em>, <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Pareudesmoscolex</em>, <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Desmoscolex</em>, and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Microlaimus</em> were found in two, or all three vent fields while their rank contributions differed among the three fields. When the data from Myojin Knoll were compared with those from other deep-sea vent environments in different regions (e.g., North Fiji Basin, East Pacific Rise, Mid-Atlantic Ridge), the nematode composition in the vent field of the Myojin caldera was more similar to that of the non-vent fields around the caldera than the composition in vent fields of other regions. These data from the Northwest Pacific Ocean also suggest the absence of long-range transport systems and local adaptations for meiofauna in hydrothermal vent fields."

All investigated faunal variables differed significantly between impact and control sediments, except for individual nematode biomass. Nematodes displayed reduced biodiversity beneath the investigated fish farms in both vegetated and non-vegetated habitats. The nematode genera <i>Richtersia</i>, <i>Desmoscolex</i> and <i>Halalaimus</i> were highly sensitive to biodeposition and disappeared almost completely in farm sediments, whereas other genera such as <i>Daptonema</i> and <i>Prochromadorella</i> largely increased their relative abundance. The impact of biodeposition was investigated also in terms of <i>K</i>-dominance curves and functional variables (life strategies as maturity index, and functional [i.e. trophic] diversity) which showed that nematodes are very sensitive to this kind of environmental disturbance. Our results indicate that the analysis of nematode assemblage composition, the life traits of the dominant species and the presence/disappearance of certain nematode species represent a reliable tool for monitoring the quality state of marine sediments exposed to fish-farm organic wastes."

Thus, three stations were selected above and two below the chemo-thermocline in order to test the possible effects of the chemical variations on the meiobenthos. The difficulty of adaptation to these environmental conditions is clearly suggested by the presence of only a few dominant meiobenthic taxa in the bottom of the cave. However, meiobenthic organisms seemed more resistant than macrobenthos, which disappeared completely below this depth. The nematode assemblage was mainly represented by Xyalidae, Desmodoridae, Comesomatidae and Linhomoeidae. A high level of confinement of nematode genera at the different depths has been documented. In the upper part, their structure and biodiversity were comparable to those of the Maldivian subtidal habitats characterised by fine coralline sediments, while a notable dominance was detected in the bottom. The Blue Hole features also influenced the functional traits of the nematode assemblage with a documented increasing number of general opportunists and decrease of Maturity Index.

The studied area exhibited spatial variation in nematode biodiversity patterns. According to habitat heterogeneity, two station groups, shallow water near shore area and shallow water continental shelf area, were observed in the Yangtze River estuary and its adjacent waters. In general, nematode abundance and species diversity in the near shore area were significantly lower than the continental shelf area. Salinity, sediment Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Phaeophytin-a (Phaeo-a) concentrations were responsible for the discrimination of species diversity measures. They reflect the reverin influence to nematode species diversity.

The funnel plots for ? and ? also indicate none of the studied stations were subjected to environmental stress and perturbation. Possibly because of nematodes' strong resistance to environmental stress, the taxonomic indices did not discriminate perturbed from unperturbed conditions in the present study.

Species richness was similar across depth horizons ranging from 12 to 18 species; it was also similar between sites with 30 and 33 species for Bacunayagua and Miramar respectively. Diversity variation was higher between the intertidal and the subtidal horizons suggesting that microhabitat plays a key role. Depth was not an important driver of the diversity of nematodes on the studied rocky shores both in terms of species richness and diversity variation. The type of microhabitat and the hydrodynamics may explain the ?-diversity patterns within sites. The site-related diversity variation was larger than the depth-related variation suggesting that a regional pattern in ?-diversity may be present. The biological traits constituted a useful complementary approach for analyzing diversity patterns indicating the prevalence of nematodes adapted to an epiphytic life-style and the effects of two putative diversity drivers: microhabitat and hydrodynamics."

Recovery of these panels took place in 2008. For this two-year deployment period, the composition of colonising organisms (both macro-and meiofauna) was assessed, along with image analyses of the deployment sites in 2006 and 2008. Very few significant differences in colonisation between organic (wood) and inorganic (slate) panels were revealed. Rather, the locality of deployment and the local environmental conditions and hydrothermal activity were found to influence taxonomic composition. Variability in microhabitat conditions and biological interactions were hypothesised to interact jointly in shaping new faunal communities on the colonisation substrata."

A species' response to stress depends on its life history. Sensitivity to harvesting is related to the life history “fast–slow” continuum, where “slow” species (i.e., large, long lived, and late maturing) are expected to be more sensitive to fishing than “fast” ones. We analyze life history traits variation for all common fish species in the Barents Sea and rank fishes along fast–slow gradients obtained by ordination analyses. In addition, we integrate species' fast–slow ranks with ecosystem survey data for the period 2004–2009, to assess life history variation at the community level in space and time. Arctic fishes were smaller, had shorter life spans, earlier maturation, larger offspring, and lower fecundity than boreal ones. Arctic fishes could thus be considered faster than the boreal species, even when body size was corrected for. Phylogenetically related species possessed similar life histories. Early in the study period, we found a strong spatial gradient, where members of fish assemblages in the southwestern Barents Sea displayed slower life histories than in the northeast. However, in later, warmer years, the gradient weakened caused by a northward movement of boreal species. As a consequence, the northeast experienced increasing proportions of slower fish species. This study is a step toward integrating life history traits in ecosystem-based areal management. On the basis of life history traits, we assess the fish sensitivity to fishing, at the species and community level. We show that climate warming promotes a borealization of fish assemblages in the northeast, associated with slower life histories in that area. The biology of Arctic species is still poorly known, and boreal species that now establish in the Arctic are fishery sensitive, which calls for cautious ecosystem management of these areas."

In this study, diatom species were analyzed from water samples collected with a Niskin bottle rosette combined with a CTD along the West Greenland coast (63°58?N–71°08?N and 50°49?W–59°06?W) during summer 2007. Diatom community was represented mainly by three genera <i>Thalassiosira, Fragilariopsis</i>, and <i>Chaetoceros</i> and linked to observed hydrographic and environmental conditions. <i>Thalassiosira</i> spp. were common in coastal waters (particularly Godthåbsfjord) and linked to increased surface water temperature, typical of summer water stratification in West Greenland. <i>Fragilariopsis</i> spp., along with other dominant species associated with higher geographic latitudes, dominated in Arctic fjords (Uummannaq Fjord-Qaumarujuk Fjord). These species generally characterized coastal waters influenced by melting sea ice and/or glacial ice. <i>Chaetoceros</i> spp. were linked to more saline open marine waters, particularly in the Davis Strait south of 70°N, probably corresponding to weaker water stratification and the influence of the West Greenland Current. The present paper provides new knowledge on diatom assemblages along a south–north climate gradient in West Greenland, which is necessary in order to understand how observed ocean-climate changes influence Arctic marine ecosystems.

Although efforts have been made to understand the diversity and function of the bacterial composition of these systems, first-level consumers, pelagic single cell heterotrophic organisms, which represent an important link between bacterial production and higher trophic levels, remain un-described in hydrothermal vents and seeps of the Nordic Seas. Here, we used a molecular biodiversity assay to investigate the impact of water masses and hydrothermal vents on the eukaryotic micro-organisms surrounding two vents systems, Jan Mayen Vent Field and Loki`s Castle, and one cold seep, Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano. The assay generated a total of 482 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a 99 % cut-off value, and the OTUs were grouped according to taxonomic rank. Data analysis using hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling with class as taxonomic entries suggested that water masses followed by depth was the dominant effect on eukaryotic micro-organism diversity. However, in one of the vent systems, Loki`s Castle, the community was different compared to the reference station. Our data suggest that while the total production of vent systems is higher than the surrounding waters, the biodiversity of eukaryotic micro-organisms is more influenced by both water masses and depth."

The general composition and level of taxonomic diversity were comparable with those reported for transitional environments worldwide. Principal component analysis revealed that the main environmental factors controlling the assemblages in terms of both composition and biological traits were grain size, organic matter, pollution load index and, only secondarily, salinity. <em>Molgolaimus allgeni, Terschellingia longicaudata</em> and <em>Leptolaimus luridus</em> showed higher values in relation to silt, organic matter and pollution load index, while <em>Axonolaimus caudostriatus, Odontophora wieseri, Paramonhystera pellucida</em> and <em>Paracanthonchus longicaudatus</em> showed higher values in relation to the redox potential and sand percentage. Salinity was detected as an influencing parameter only secondarily and particularly for <em>Calomicrolaimus honestus, Daptonema normandicum, Thalassomonhystera parva</em> and <em>Sabatieria pulchra</em>. With respect to functional traits, the trophic groups seemed to be mainly related to sediment type, which is in turn reflected by the nature of the available food. The maturity index, as well as c-p classes, did not always permit a clear interpretation of the interaction between anthropogenic and natural factors. However, the greater influence of the San Antonino and San Francesco Canals was perfectly revealed by the nematode assemblage.

The total technical potential in China’s exclusive economic zone is estimated to be 1715 TWh/year under the current technical level of offshore wind farms and turbines. However, spatial constraints, including designated shipping lanes, submarine cables, and bird migratory paths, as well as visual exclusion, would eliminate approximately 8.7% of the total technical potential, having the most significant impacts on shallower waters (below 20-m sea depths). Considering only the technical potential locates in areas with sea depths less than 50 meters to be economical, the available economic potential is merely 715 TWh with an average levelized production cost ranging from 0.419 to 0.975 RMB/kWh (43–100 €/MWh). Through a set of sensitivity analyses, it has been demonstrated that the GIS model may also provide a comprehensive framework for policy makers and investors to understand and strategize for the available offshore potential under different technical, spatial, and economic scenarios now and in the future; the GIS tool and analytical results are also flexible, upgradable, and updatable as more comprehensive and accurate data sets become accessible."

Molecular phylogeny and venom peptide characterization provide an unusual multidisciplinary view of conoidean biodiversity at several taxonomic levels. Venom peptides diverge between species at an unprecedented rate through hypermutation within gene families. Clade divergence within a genus occurs without recruiting new gene families when a saltatory event, such as colonization of new prey types (e.g., fish), leads to a new radiation. Divergence between genera in the same family involves substantial divergence in gene families.

Numerous applications of DNA barcoding in taxonomy, ecology, bioconservation, and biosafety contributed to a spectacular development of this initiative administered by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL). Reference databases that assign DNA barcodes to particular morphospecies have been developed for almost all groups of animals, plants, and fungi, as well as some groups of protists (i.e., diatoms, ciliates, amoebae). However, such a database does not exist for foraminifera, despite large numbers of DNA sequences being available. To fill this gap, we initiated the Foram Barcoding (FB) project, whose objective is to create a curated molecular database for modern foraminifera. Each species included in our database is represented by one or several specimens, from which DNA was extracted and sequenced. Species entries include photos of processed specimens, taxonomic references, and DNA barcode sequences. A fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, commonly used in foraminiferal molecular studies, was chosen as the DNA barcode. We believe that the FB project will help resolve at least some misidentification problems that plague foraminiferal taxonomy. We also foresee its further applications in such domains of foraminiferal research as diversity assessment, ecology, biogeography, and biomonitoring. However, we are aware that the impact of the FB database depends mainly on its completeness and accuracy, and thus we appeal to the community of foraminiferologists to support this project by providing material for genetic studies and by contributing their taxonomic expertise in species identification and documentation."

"Foraging macrofauna, such as the sand dollar <i>Encope emarginata</i>, can modify sediment properties and affect spatial distribution patterns of microphytobenthos and meiobenthos at different spatial scales. We adopted a spatial hierarchical approach composed of five spatial levels (km, 100 s m, 10 s m, 1 s m and cm) to describe variation patterns of microphytobenthos, meiobenthos and sediment variables in shallow subtidal regions in the subtropical Paranaguá Bay (Southern Brazil) with live <i>E. emarginata</i> (LE), dead <i>E. emarginata</i> (only skeletons — (DE), and no <i>E. emarginata</i> (WE). The overall structure of microphytobenthos and meiofauna was always less variable at WE and much of variation at the scale of 100 s m was related to variability within LE and DE, due to foraging activities or to the presence of shell hashes. Likewise, increased variability in chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and phaeopigment contents was observed among locations within LE, although textural parameters of sediment varied mainly at smaller scales. Variations within LE were related to changes on the amount and quality of food as a function of sediment heterogeneity induced by the foraging behavior of sand dollars. We provide strong evidence that top-down effects related to the occurrence of <i>E. emarginata</i> act in synergy with bottom-up structuring related to hydrodynamic processes in determining overall benthic spatial variability. Conversely, species richness is mainly influenced by environmental heterogeneity at small spatial scales (centimeters to meters), which creates a mosaic of microhabitats."

From chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration and zooplankton biovolume perspective mesotrophic conditions prevailed in comparison with the Gulf of California during November. Crustaceans numerically dominated the zooplankton assemblage (92.3%) [Copepoda (79.2%), Decapoda larvae (4.7%), Cladocera (3.7%), Mysidacea (2.7%), and Euphausiacea (2.0%)]. The other 15 taxonomic groups (7.7% combined) accounted each one less than 1.5% of the relative abundance. Species richness of selected taxa (~56%&gt;) included 259 taxa (121 identified to species, 117 to genus, and 21 not identified). Tropical species from neritic affinity clearly dominated zooplankton assemblage around IMA. Five tropical Copepoda species [<i>Calanopia minor</i> (Dana), <i>Clausocalanus jobei</i> Frost <i>&amp;</i> Fleminger, <i>Acrocalanus gibber</i> Giesbrecht, <i>Canthocalanus pauper</i> (Giesbrecht), and <i>Centropages furcatus</i> (Dana)], a cladoceran <i>Pseudevadne tergestina</i> (Claus), and a Mysidacea species (<i>Mysidium reckettsi</i> Harrison <i>&amp;</i> Bowman) dominated the zooplankton assemblage (accounting about 55% of total abundance of the identified species). Except <i>C. furcatus,</i> all these species are not abundant at oceanic regions of the central and northern Gulf of California. The similarity of multiple neritic and tropical species in the zooplankton assemblage from IMA and Cape Corrientes suggests strong coastal-insular plankton connectivity. Episodic current plumes associated with anomalous intense rivers discharge during rainy years, eddies generated by coastal upwelling event that move offshore, and northward regional oceanic circulation are the most likely mesoscale oceanographic processes that cause costal tropical zooplankton drift enhancing coastal-Archipelago species connectivity in this region."

287879	2014	AS	Genetic structuring across marine biogeographic boundaries in rocky shore invertebrates	"Biogeography investigates spatial patterns of species distribution. Discontinuities in species distribution are identified as boundaries between biogeographic areas. Do these boundaries affect genetic connectivity? To address this question, a multifactorial hierarchical sampling design, across three of the major marine biogeographic boundaries in the central Mediterranean Sea (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian, Tyrrhenian-Ionian and Ionian-Adriatic) was carried out. Mitochondrial COI sequence polymorphism of seven species of Mediterranean benthic invertebrates was analysed. Two species showed significant genetic structure across the Tyrrhenian-Ionian boundary, as well as two other species across the Ionian Sea, a previously unknown phylogeographic barrier. The hypothesized barrier in the Ligurian-Tyrrhenian cannot be detected in the genetic structure of the investigated species. Connectivity patterns across species at distances up to 800 km apart confirmed that estimates of pelagic larval dispersal were poor predictors of the genetic structure. The detected genetic discontinuities seem more related to the effect of past historical events, though maintained by present day oceanographic processes. Multivariate statistical tools were used to test the consistency of the patterns across species, providing a conceptual framework for across-species barrier locations and strengths. Additional sequences retrieved from public databases supported our findings. Heterogeneity of phylogeographic patterns shown by the 7 investigated species is relevant to the understanding of the genetic diversity, and carry implications for conservation biology."

The largest family (241 known species), Polycystididae, is represented by nine of 10 subfamilies and 33 of the 58 genera. Sequence data from 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA were analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Of the two taxa traditionally recognised within Kalyptorhynchia, Eukalyptorhynchia and Schizorhynchia, only Schizorhynchia is monophyletic. All eukalyptorhynch families, except Cicerinidae, are monophyletic. On the other hand, two of the three schizorhynch families included are not monophyletic. Within Polycystididae, the traditional taxonomy was not reflected in our phylogenetic analyses and most subfamilies are polyphyletic. These results suggest that current classification, mostly based on characters of the genital system, suffers from homoplasy.

This southernmost part of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is a typical high-latitude Antarctic region located in the circumpolar permanent pack-ice zone. It became accessible for large-scale scientific surveys only through the availability of modern ice-breaking research vessels, such as the German RV “Polarstern”. Here, we describe a dataset of the faunal composition and abundance of starfish, brittle star and sea cucumber assemblages in this area, based on collections from trawl catches carried out during three “Polarstern” cruises in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The set comprises a total of 4, 509 records of abundances of 35 asteroid species (with a total of 2, 089 specimens) and 38 ophiuroid species (with a total of 18, 484 specimens) from 34 stations, as well as of 66 holothurian species (with a total of 20, 918 specimens) from 59 stations including zero-abundances (absences). A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. Overall, starfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers were present at all sites investigated in the study area but composition and abundance of asterozoan (asteroids and ophiuroids together) and holothurian fauna varied considerably. A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. In the case of asterozoans, water depth and latitude seemed to be the most important drivers of assemblage distribution and composition. One of the holothurian assemblages was part of the rich macrozoobenthic community dominated by a diverse and abundant epifauna, mainly sponges and gorgonians. Another one was mainly composed of vagrant deposit-feeding species inhabiting a predominantly non-colonised substratum. In addition, a mixed holothurian assemblage was identified."

Whereas a morphological identification of many species is challenging, the application of molecular markers represents a promising approach for species discrimination and identification. In this study, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, combining both molecular and morphological methods, to characterize nematodes of distinct sex and ontogenetic stages from three sampling sites of the North Sea. Morphospecies were discriminated after first visual determination, followed by a molecular analysis of the nuclear 28S rDNA: D2–D3 marker. By linking each sequence to a morphological voucher, discordant morphological identification was subjected to a so-called reverse taxonomic approach. Molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and morphospecies were compared for all of the three sampling sites to assess concordance of methodology. In total, 32 MOTUs and 26 morphospecies were assigned, of which 12 taxa were identified as described species. Both approaches showed high concordance in taxon assignment (84.4 %) except for a cluster comprising various Sabatieria species. Our study revealed the high potential of the analyzed fragment as a useful molecular marker for the identification of the North Sea nematodes and highlighted the applicability of this combined taxonomic approach in general."
