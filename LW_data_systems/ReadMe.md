## Mailing list
This list constitutes the people that are registered for the users@lifewatch.be mailinglist.

This list was exported from our database. For each person on the list, the following set of steps were followed to identify and add their institute affiliation: 
1. The institute was identified based on the characters following the '@' in the email address. 
In case these characters didn't refer to an institute (for example 'hotmail', 'gmail',...), the person's affiliation was considered 'personal'. 
2. More detailed affiliations were identified by looking up the persons name in combination with the identified affiliation both in [IMIS](http://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=person) and on the web.

In order to be GDPR compliant, the name and email adress were left out afterwards.
