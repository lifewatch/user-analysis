An introductory overview of the four classes of the Porifera is followed by a description of the structure of our main source of data for this paper, the WPD. From this we extracted numbers of all ‘known’ sponges to date: the number of valid Recent sponges is established at 8,553, with the vast majority, 83%, belonging to the class Demospongiae. We also mapped for the first time the species richness of a comprehensive set of marine ecoregions of the world, data also extracted from the WPD. Perhaps not surprisingly, these distributions appear to show a strong bias towards collection and taxonomy efforts. Only when species richness is accumulated into large marine realms does a pattern emerge that is also recognized in many other marine animal groups: high numbers in tropical regions, lesser numbers in the colder parts of the world oceans. Preliminary similarity analysis of a matrix of species and marine ecoregions extracted from the WPD failed to yield a consistent hierarchical pattern of ecoregions into marine provinces. Global sponge diversity information is mostly generated in regional projects and resources: results obtained demonstrate that regional approaches to analytical biogeography are at present more likely to achieve insights into the biogeographic history of sponges than a global perspective, which appears currently too ambitious. We also review information on invasive sponges that might well have some influence on distribution patterns of the future.","Van Soest, R.W.M.; Boury-Esnault, N.; Vacelet, J.; Dohrmann, M.; Erpenbeck, D.; de Voogd, N.J.; Santodomingo, N.; Vanhoorne, B.; Kelly, M.; Hooper, J.N.A.",WOS:000305336000024,"Vanhoorne, Bart, B.",Flanders Marine Institute-VLIZ,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035105,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Porifera,"Biodiversity, ""Databases"", ""Taxonomy""",NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We show that overall, seabirds are more threatened than other comparable groups of birds and that their status has deteriorated faster over recent decades. The principal current threats at sea are posed by commercial fisheries (through competition and mortality on fishing gear) and pollution, whereas on land, alien invasive predators, habitat degradation and human disturbance are the main threats. Direct exploitation remains a problem for some species both at sea and ashore. The priority actions needed involve: a) formal and effective site protection, especially for Important Bird Area (IBA) breeding sites and for marine IBA feeding and aggregation sites, as part of national, regional and global networks of Marine Protected Areas; b) removal of invasive, especially predatory, alien species (a list of priority sites is provided), as part of habitat and species recovery initiatives; and c) reduction of bycatch to negligible levels, as part of comprehensive implementation of ecosystem approaches to fisheries. The main knowledge gaps and research priorities relate to the three topics above but new work is needed on impacts of aquaculture, energy generation operations and climate change (especially effects on the distribution of prey species and rise in sea level).

Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (<em>sensu</em> Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, <em>Pecten maximus</em> and <em>Glycymeris glycymeris</em>, and two ecologically important species, <em>Abra alba</em> and <em>Ophelia borealis</em> were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050–2059 and 2090–2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for <em>A.</em> <em>alba</em>. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future. The displacement and colonisation success of species are a function of many other non-climatic factors such as species life histories, dispersal abilities, adaptability and community interactions.","Rombouts, I.; Beaugrand, G.; Dauvin, J.C.",WOS:000302448300015,"Rombouts, Isabelle, I.","Univ Sci Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, UMR CNRS LOG 8187, F-62930 Wimereux, France.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.12.026,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",English Channel,NULL,"Climatic changes, ""Ecological niches"", ""Modelling""",NULL,Benthic macrofauna,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Defining habitat characteristics influencing the distribution, density and growth of plaice (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>) and dab (<i>Limanda limanda</i>) on west of Ireland nursery grounds. PhD Thesis. Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology: Galway.  178 pp.","Plaice (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>, L.) and dab (<i>Limanda limanda</i>, L.) are among the most abundant flatfishes in the north-eastern Atlantic region and the dominant species in shallow coastal nursery grounds. With increasing pressures on commercial flatfish stocks in combination with changing coastal environments, better knowledge of population dynamics during all life stages is needed to evaluate variability in year-class strength and recruitment to the fishery. The aim of this research was to investigate the complex interplay of biotic and abiotic habitat components influencing the distribution, density and growth of plaice and dab during the vulnerable juvenile life stage and to gain insight in spatial and temporal differences in nursery habitat quality along the west coast of Ireland. Intraspecific variability in plaice diet was observed at different spatial scales and showed a link with condition, recent growth and morphology. This highlights the effect of food availability on habitat quality and the need to consider small scale variation when attempting to link habitat quality to feeding, growth and condition of juvenile flatfish. There was evidence of trophic, spatial and temporal resource partitioning between juvenile plaice and dab allowing the co-existence of morphologically similar species in nursery grounds. In the limited survey years there was no evidence that the carrying capacity of the studied nursery grounds was reached but spatial and interannual variations in fish growth indicated fluctuating environments in terms of food availability, predator densities, sediment features and physico-chemical conditions. Predation was the most important factor affecting habitat quality for juvenile plaice and dab with crab densities negatively correlated to fish condition whereas shrimp densities were negatively associated with densities of small-sized juveniles in spring. A comparison of proxies for fish growth showed the advantage of Fulton’s <i>K</i> for routine use whereas RNA:DNA ratios proved less powerful when short-term environmental fluctuations are lacking. This study illustrated how distinct sets of habitat features can drive spatial variation in density and condition of juvenile flatfish highlighting the value of studying both variables when modeling habitat requirements. The habitat models generated in this study also provide a powerful tool to predict potential climate and anthropogenic impacts on the distribution and condition of juveniles in flatfish nurseries. The need for effective coastal zone management was emphasized to ensure a sustainable use of coastal resources and successful flatfish recruitment to the fishery.

We also provide partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene from the new species that can be used as a molecular diagnostic characteristic.","Song, J.-H.; Moreira, J.; Min, G.-S.",WOS:000320680900012,"Moreira, Juan, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1163/1937240X-00002106,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Leptostraca, ""Nebalia pseudotroncosoi""",New species,NULL,Nebalia pseudotroncosoi,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The formation of new small (colorless) oocytes occurred in the post-spawning period, between August and October. However, individual oocyte size–frequency distributions of the colonies showed that there was no synchrony in late and early oogenesis.

The polychaetes represent a conspicuous component of benthic communities in Canadian marine waters, yet information on species diversity and distribution is available only at the local scale. This study compiles polychaete species records from Canada over the last 150 years to assess broad-scale patterns of species richness, beta diversity (partitioned into turnover and nestedness), and species distributions in the surrounding Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans. Records indicate the presence of 1200 species belonging to 68 families, while statistical extrapolation estimated a total of 1629 species. Pacific waters have the highest richness with 791 recorded species. The eastern and western regions of the Arctic Ocean have the highest faunal similarity, but the fewest endemic species, reflecting the recent ice-free status of this basin. Species turnover is highest between Pacific and Atlantic basins, decreases with geographic proximity, and is lowest in comparisons with Hudson Bay. Similar patterns of turnover between temperate and (sub)Arctic basins suggest that both Atlantic and Pacific faunas played an important role in Arctic recolonization following deglaciation. Despite the vast geographic area, nearly 13% of species are reported in all three oceans; however, many of these taxa likely represent species complexes. These results highlight the need for more detailed examination of many species with broad distributions and suggest that diversity in Canada is currently underestimated.","Carr, C.M.",WOS:000304098000002,"Carr, Christina, C.M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-011-0095-y,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Canada,Polychaeta,"Biogeography, ""Species diversity""",NULL,Species checklist,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, the spatial extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental, before–after and inside–outside (control-impacted), situations for assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand’s oldest marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30 years previously. Areas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock) lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks, increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when invasive species reach the reserve. No-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for ecosystems. Because these changes in ecosystem structure may continue, and will vary with environment, climate and species distributions, reserves need to be permanent and replicated geographically. Habitat maps should be produced for all reserves to enable ecological changes in the ecosystem to be spatially quantified.","Leleu, K.; Remy-Zephir, B.; Grace, R.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000309572200024,"Leleu, Kévin, K.","Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.009,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",New Zealand,Ecklonia,"Ecosystems, ""Fish"", ""Kelps"", ""Lobsters"", ""Mapping"", ""Predators"", ""Time series""",NULL,Kelp forest; Ecosystem change; Predator release;  Subtidal mapping; Urchin Barren,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discoveredResults: There are ~226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (~20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ~170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science.Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.","Appeltans, W.; Ahyong, S.T.; Anderson, G.; Angel, M.V.; Artois, T.; Bailly, N.; Bamber, R.N.; Barber, A.; Bartsch, I.; Berta, A.; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz , M.; Bock, P.; Boxshall, G.; Boyko, C.B.; Nunes Brandão, S.; Bray, R.A.; Bruce, N.L.; Cairns, S.D.; Chan, T.-Y.; Cheng, L.; Collins, A.G.; Cribb, T.H.; Curini-Galletti, M.; Dahdouh-Guebas, F.; Davie, P.J.F.; Dawson, M.N.; De Clerck, O.; Decock, W.; De Grave, S.; de Voogd, N.J.; Domning, D.P.; Emig, C.C.; Erséus, Ch.; Eschmeyer, W.; Fauchald, K.; Fautin, D.G.; Feist, S.W.; Fransen, C.H.J.M.; Furuya, H.; García-Alvarez, O.; Gerken, S.; Gibson, D.; Gittenberger, A.; Gofas, S.; Gómez-Daglio, L.; Gordon, D.P.; Guiry, M.D.; Hernandez, F.; Hoeksema, B.W.; Hopcroft, R.R.; Jaume, D.; Kirk, P.; Koedam, N.; Koenemann, S.; Kolb, J.B.; Kristensen, R.M.; Kroh, A.; Lambert, G.; Lazarus, D.B.; Lemaitre, R.; Longshaw, M.; Lowry, J.; MacPherson, E.; Madin, L.P.; Mah, C.; Mapstone, G.; McLaughlin, P.A.; Mees, J.; Meland, K.; Messing, C.G.; Mills, C.E.; Molodtsova, T.N.; Mooi, R.; Neuhaus, B.; Ng, P.K.L.; Nielsen, C.; Norenburg, J.; Opresko, D.M.; Osawa, M.; Paulay, G.; Perrin, W.; Pilger, J.F.; Poore, G.C.B.; Pugh, Ph.R.; Read, G.B.; Reimer, J.D.; Rius, M.; Rocha, R.M.; Sáiz Salinas, J.I.; Scarabino, V.; Schierwater, B.; Schmidt-Rhaesa, A.; Schnabel, K.E.; Schotte, M.; Schuchert, P.; Schwabe, E.; Segers, H.; Self-Sullivan, C.; Shenkar, N.; Siegel, V.; Sterrer, W.; Stöhr, S.; Swalla, B.; Tasker, M.L.; Thuesen, E.V.; Timm, T.; Todaro, M.A.; Turon, X.; Tyler, S.; Uetz, P.; van der Land, J.; Vanhoorne, B.; van Ofwegen, L.P.; Van Soest, R.W.M.; Vanaverbeke, J.; Walker-Smith, G.K.; Walter, T.C.; Warren, A.; Williams, G.C.; Wilson, S.P.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000312115300015,"Costello, Mark, M.J.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.036,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Global,NULL,Species diversity,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Under the Census framework, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System was established to coordinate an unprecedented aggregation of global marine biogeography data. The OBIS data system now contains 31.3 million observations, freely accessible through a geospatial portal. The challenges of storing, querying, disseminating, and mapping a global data collection of this complexity and magnitude are significant. In the face of declining performance and expanding feature requests, a redevelopment of the OBIS data system was undertaken. Following an Open Source philosophy, the OBIS technology stack was rebuilt using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer and OpenLayers. This approach has markedly improved the performance and online user experience while maintaining a standards-compliant and interoperable framework. Due to the distributed nature of the project and increasing needs for storage, scalability and deployment flexibility, the entire hardware and software stack was built on a Cloud Computing environment. The flexibility of the platform, combined with the power of the application stack, enabled rapid re-development of the OBIS infrastructure, and ensured complete standards-compliance.","Fujioka, E.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Donnelly, B.; Castillo, J.; Cleary, J.; Holmes, C.; McKnight, S.; Halpin, P.",WOS:000302798300005,"Vanden Berghe, Edward, E.","Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01310.x,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,"Data collections, ""Data systems""",NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Comparable compilations of biological data are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these patterns, but have received far less attention. We assess the availability of biological data across an entire assemblage: the well-documented demersal marine fauna of the United Kingdom. We also test whether data availability for a species depends on its taxonomic group, maximum body size, the number of times it has been recorded in a global biogeographic database, or its commercial and conservation importance.  Location Seas of the United Kingdom.  Methods We defined a demersal marine fauna of 973 species from 15 phyla and 40 classes using five extensive surveys around the British Isles. We then quantified the availability of data on eight key biological traits (termed biological knowledge) for each species from online databases. Relationships between biological knowledge and our predictors were tested with generalized linear models.  Results Full data on eight fundamental biological traits exist for only 9% (<i>n</i> = 88) of the UK demersal marine fauna, and 20% of species completely lack data. Clear trends in our knowledge exist: fish (median biological knowledge score = six traits) are much better known than invertebrates (one trait). Biological knowledge increases with biogeographic knowledge and (to a lesser extent) with body size, and is greater in species that are commercially exploited or of conservation concern.  Main conclusions Our analysis reveals deep ignorance of the basic biology of a well-studied fauna, highlighting the need for far greater efforts to compile biological trait data. Clear biases in our knowledge, relating to how well sampled or ‘important’ species are suggests that caution is required in extrapolating small subsets of biologically well-known species to ecosystem-level studies.","Tyler, E.H.M.; Somerfield, P.J.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Bremmer, J.; Jackson, E.; Langmead, O.; Palomares, M.L.D.; Webb, T.J.",WOS:000307897200005,"Tyler, Elizabeth, E.H.M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00726.x,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",United Kingdom,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Demersal fisheries"", ""Ecosystems"", ""Missing data""",NULL,Benthic invertebrates; Biological traits analysis; Demersal fishes: Ecosystem function; Functional traits; Marine biodiversity; Marine macroecology,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management.By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes.

The effects of temperature on performance traits (i.e., growth and photosynthesis) and temperature tolerance ranges (i.e., survival) have been experimentally determined for a wide variety of seaweed species and explain large-scale biogeographic distribution patterns. In contrast, studies on temperature effects on cellular components (i.e., proteins and membranes) and environmentally induced changes in transcriptional processes still remain scarce. One major obstacle has been the lack of genomic information of seaweed species, which is now increasing.

Multiscale variability of amphipod assemblages in <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows: a comparison between different protection levels. PhD Thesis. Laboratory of Oceanology. University of Liège: Liège.  ","Despite the rapid expansion of marine protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea, very few studies have addressed macrozoobenthos responses to protection. The aim of this work was to assess and better understand the potential responses of amphipod assemblages in Posidonia oceanica meadows between different protection levels. Two approaches were used. First, multiscale variability patterns of amphipod assemblages were investigated at the Revellata Bay (France) and the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (TMP A, Italy), over spatial scales spanning five orders of magnitude (-1 m to >100s of km) for two consecutive years. Second, the role of fish predation in affecting amphipod assemblages was evaluated using experimental manipulations of predation intensity. Amphipod assemblages of P. oceanica meadows were typified by high density and number of species. Our research revealed that amphipod natural variability was great at small and large scales in P. oceanica meadows. At small scales (from -1 m to -10 m), this pattern was in relation to both total amphipod density and/ or several species densities, which may be explained by behavioural traits of amphipods. At large scale (>100 km), the structure of amphipod assemblages was different between meadows and may be related to hydrodynamic forces. During this research, a new caprellid, Caprella tavolarensis was discovered and described. The species is close to Caprella liparotensis, but can be clearly distinguished by smaller size, presence of a short rostrum, body elongate and dorsally smooth, absence of serrate carina on the basis of gnathopod 2 and pereopods, mouthparts scarcely setose, absence of fine setae on peduncle of antenna 1 and absence of swimming setae on antenna 2. At the 1MP A, the structure of amphipod assemblages differed markedly among protection levels. Moreover, it was observed lower densities and/ or biomasses of several frequent taxa within the fully protected area and outside the MPA compared to partially protected areas. Meadow features account only for a low proportion of the amphipod variability, while predation by fish seemed to be an important factor in structuring P. oceanica amphipod populations. Overall, this work suggests that full protection at the 1MP A is likely to contribute partially (primarily via fish predation) to the observed variability patterns among zones. However, superimposed factors including behavioural traits of amphipod species and surrounding habitats are likely to be also significant. Whether these changes are representative of all fully protected areas and whether those effects are positive or negative to the meadows, are still unknown.

Alternatively, pantropical distributions challenge the belief of limited intrinsic dispersal capacity of marine seaweeds and the effectiveness of the north-south oriented continents as dispersal barriers. We aimed to re-assess the distribution of two allegedly circumtropical brown algae, Dictyota ciliolata and D. crenulata, and interpret the realized geographical range of the respective species in relation to their thermal tolerance and major tectonic and climatic events during the Cenozoic.    Methodology/Principal Findings    Species delimitation was based on 184 chloroplast encoded psbA sequences, using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by analyzing a six-gene dataset. Divergence times were estimated using relaxed molecular clock methods and published calibration data. Distribution ranges of the species were inferred from DNA-confirmed records, complemented with credible literature data and herbarium vouchers. Temperature tolerances of the species were determined by correlating distribution records with local SST values. We found considerable conflict between traditional and DNA-based species definitions. Dictyota crenulata consists of several pseudocryptic species, which have restricted distributions in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Central America. In contrast, the pantropical distribution of D. ciliolata is confirmed and linked to its significantly wider temperature tolerance.    Conclusions/Significance    Tectonically driven rearrangements of physical barriers left an unequivocal imprint on the current diversity patterns of marine macroalgae, as witnessed by the D. crenulata–complex. The nearly circumglobal tropical distribution of D. ciliolata, however, demonstrates that the north-south oriented continents do not present absolute dispersal barriers for species characterized by wide temperature tolerances.","Tronholm, A.; Leliaert, F.; Sansón, M.; Afonso-Carrillo, J.; Tyberghein, L.; Verbruggen, H.; De Clerck, O.",WOS:000301703800032,"Verbruggen, Heroen, H.","Phycology Research Group and Centre for Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Ghent University",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0030813,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The NS, BS and to a lesser extent SC notched specimens were morphologically similar and partly coincided to the ‘canonical’ description of the species. By contrast, WS population showed remarkable anatomical and morphometric peculiarities that correspond to some earlier descriptions. Genetic analyses of mitochondrial (cytochrome <i>b</i>) and nuclear (28S rDNA) genes demonstrated the significant distinctness among WS, both SC and (NS+BS) populations, the latter two being genetically indistinguishable. Concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees and morphological data supports that <i>N. palustris</i> is in fact composed of several pseudo-sibling species, which are genetically and morphologically divergent. Neither correlation between genetic divergence and geographical distance nor significant intrapopulation diversity was found for these species. Taxonomic status, distribution and phylogenetic relationships of the species within the <i>Nannopus</i> genus need to be reconsidered. A further subdivision of species complexes might have important implications for the analysis of biodiversity of benthic copepods and consequently for the interpretation of their (species-specific) ecological function.","Garlitska, L.; Neretina, T.; Schepetov, D.; Mugue, N.; De Troch, M.; Baguley, J.G.; Azovsky, A.",WOS:000310065600016,"Garlitska, Lesya, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/mec.12016,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Harpacticoida, ""Nannopus palustris""",NULL,NULL,    cryptic species;     genetic diversity;     Harpacticoida;     meiofauna;     morphology;     <i>Nannopus palustris</i> ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here we undertake a synthesis of present knowledge of biodiversity in European Seas and identify remaining challenges that prevent sustainable management of marine biodiversity in one of the most exploited continents of the globe. Our analysis demonstrates that changes in faunal standing stock with depth depends on the size of the fauna, with macrofaunal abundance only declining with increasing water depth below 1000 m, whilst there was no obvious decrease in meiofauna with increasing depth. Species richness was highly variable for both deep water macro- and meio- fauna along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Nematode biodiversity decreased from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean whilst latitudinal related biodiversity patterns were similar for both faunal groups investigated, suggesting that the same environmental drivers were influencing the fauna. While climate change and habitat degradation are the most frequently implicated stressors affecting biodiversity throughout European Seas, quantitative understanding, both at individual and cumulative/synergistic level, of their influences are often lacking. Full identification and quantification of species, in even a single marine habitat, remains a distant goal, as we lack integrated data-sets to quantify these. While the importance of safeguarding marine biodiversity is recognised by policy makers, the lack of advanced understanding of species diversity and of a full survey of any single habitat raises huge challenges in quantifying change, and facilitating/prioritising habitat/ecosystem protection. Our study highlights a pressing requirement for more complete biodiversity surveys to be undertaken within contrasting habitats, together with investigations in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning links and identification of separate and synergistic/cumulative human-induced impacts on biodiversity.","Narayanaswamy, B.E.; Coll, M.; Danovaro, R.; Davidson, K.; Ojaveer, H.; Renaud, P.E.",WOS:000316411600015,"Renaud, Paul, P.E.","Univ Ctr Svalbard, Longyearbyen, Norway.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0058909,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Europe,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Ecosystems"", ""Protection"", ""Species diversity""",NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential ‘mediation effects’ among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80% of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions.

Many sharks returned to The Bahamas after ~150 days. Estimated residency times within The Bahamas EEZ, where longlining and commercial trade of sharks is illegal, were generally high (mean = 68.2% of time). Sharks spent 99.7% of their time shallower than 200 m and did not exhibit differences in day and night mean depths.

Out of a total of 336 protected areas identified in Brazilian coastal and marine areas, the North Platform has the largest protected area, but the ecosystem with the largest number of protected area, predominantly sustainable areas, was the East Coast followed by the South Platform. One of the reasons the eastern coast of Brazil to have more protected areas is the fact that there is a largest amount of coral reefs. Additionally there was political opportunities for the creation of protected areas for sustainable use. The coastal region of Brazil has achieved the goal proposed by the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity – 7, but only then through the category V of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which is not the best efficient means of conserving resources. The goal for marine conservation shows only the area above the recommended under protection in North Platform. The Marine portion of the East Coast and the South Platform has few protected areas, regardless of category management. We consider the coastal region the range of 12 nautical miles from baselines determined in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As for the number of strategies permitted by law and used for the conservation of coastal and marine systems, coastal systems show a higher number when compared with the marine system. We suggest that the Brazilian government should specify strategies for the protection of marine systems and expand the protected areas of all Large Marine Ecosystems.","Schiavetti, A.; Manz, J.; dos Santos, C.Z.; Magro, T.C.; Pagani, M.I.",WOS:000318388700011,"Schiavetti, Alexandre, A.","State Univ Santa Cruz UESC, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.02.003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Brazil,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We tested whether, at the country level, the proportion of a country designated as a conservation priority was correlated with where NGOs spent money. For one model (the combination of Conservation International's hotspots and High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas, which are areas of high endemism with high or low levels of vegetation loss respectively), there was no relation between the proportion of a country designated as a priority and levels of NGO spending, including by the NGO associated with the model. In the second model (Global 200), the proportion of a country designated as a priority and the amount of money spent by NGOs were significantly and positively related. Less money was spent in countries in northern and western sub-Saharan Africa than countries in southern and eastern Africa, relative to the proportion of the country designated as a conservation priority. We suggest that on the basis of our results some NGOs consider increasing their spending on the areas designated as of conservation priority which are currently relatively underfunded, although there are economic, political, cultural, historical, biological, and practical reasons why current spending patterns may not align with priority sites.","Holmes, G.; Scholfield, K.; Brockington, D.",WOS:000306559300004,"Holmes, George, G.","Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01879.x,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Africa,NULL,Conservation,NULL,Africa; conservation spending; high biodiversity wilderness areas;hotspots; NGOs; prioritization modeling; Africa; areas de importanciapara la conservacion; areas silvestres con alta biodiversidad; gasto enconservacion; modelos de priorizacion; ONGs,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Experience from terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to effectively coordinate across multiple management regimes. We identify key elements for future high seas management and posit that a two-pronged approach is most promising: the development of an improved global legal regime that incorporates systematic planning as well as the expansion of existing and new regional agreements and mandates.

We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea (previously Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea) and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process.

However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems must be based on total removals, so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. Total removals by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929 to 2010, were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. The reconstructed total removals on the BNS were estimated to be 55% higher than the 0.8 million t publicly reported over this period. Discards represent an average annual of 34% of the total removals on the BNS over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000s, approximately 50% of all Belgian removals from its EEZ are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (<12 m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical total removals for Belgium's sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives.","Lescrauwaet, A.-K.; Torreele, E.; Vincx, M.; Polet, H.; Mees, J.",WOS:000325191900019,"Lescrauwaet, Ann-Katrien, A.-K.",Flanders Marine Institute VLIZ,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2013.05.007,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Belgium,NULL,"By catch, ""Fishery statistics"", ""Historical account"", ""Marine fisheries""",NULL,Catch reconstruction; IUU; EEZ; unreported catch,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The genus <em>Scaphander</em> is a group of predominantly deep-sea, infaunal cephalaspids with about 40% of its species (eight) occurring on the Atlantic Ocean. They are carnivorous and have a unique digestive system with a large, strongly muscularized gizzard containing three sizable and heavily calcified plates. This work aims to describe the diet of <em>Scaphander</em>, to evaluate if there is a functional relation between the anatomy of the digestive tract and exploitation of novel food resources, and to assess if dietary specialization may have played a role in the diversification of the Atlantic species of <em>Scaphander</em>. Gut contents were studied from 31 specimens representing seven of the Atlantic species using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The chemical composition of the gizzard plates was analysed by X-ray microanalysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Foraminiferans, including agglutinating forms, were shown to be the most important food item for <em>Scaphander</em>; bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, and polychaetes with calcareous tubes were also found to form part of the diet. The gizzard plates were shown to consist of a phosphate-rich amorphous component and a crystalline component identified as fluorite (hardness 4; Moh's scale). It is suggested that the ability of <em>Scaphander</em> gastropods to prey upon organisms with hard tests, particularly agglutinating foraminiferans, is not only due to the hardness of the gizzard plates but to the cumulative effect of shape and hardness of the gizzard plates and relative size of the gizzard and associated musculature.

Belgian fisheries: ten decades, seven seas, forty species: Historical time-series to reconstruct landings, catches, fleet and fishing areas from 1900. PhD Thesis. Ghent University (UGent): Gent.  xiii, 242 pp.","Human activity has been impacting marine ecosystems for millennia, and fishing is most often seen as the cause of overexploitation and depletion of marine biological resources (Myers and Worm 2003, Salomon 2009). There is a wealth of recent studies illustrating how our perception of pristine conditions in the seas and oceans has shifted over generations. This is referred to as ‘Shifting Baselines’. A wide range of evidence about (pre) historical reference conditions and early baselines has increased the awareness on the limitations associated with the current scientific methods to determine appropriate reference conditions against which current targets for conservation and management are set, in particular for fisheries (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008). It is acknowledged that environmental reference conditions and targets must strive to integrate all available and relevant data and information for improved assessments, including incorporating historical data into conservation and management frameworks (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008, McClenachan et al. 2012). Historical data can contribute in explaining underlying cause-effect relations in changes in the ecosystems, potentially reveal information and knowledge from past conditions (Jackson et al. 2001), and help defining reference conditions and achievable targets for environmental management today. The present thesis focuses on quantitative data to extend the timeframe of current analyses on fisheries (landings, fleet dynamics, spatial dynamics, indexes of productivity of the fleet and impact of fishing) and on the reconstruction of historical timeseries to expand our knowledge on historical references for the Belgian sea fisheries. In achieving this, it intends to counter the concept of 'Shifting Baselines' applied to the Belgian Sea fisheries. The ‘Historical Fisheries Database’ (HiFiDatabase) is a product of this thesis. It is the result of a thorough search, rescue, inventory, standardization and integration of data for Belgium’s sea fisheries that were not available before in the public domain or were not available before in the appropriate format for redistribution. It is documented and stored in the Marine Data Archive of Flanders Marine Institute and is freely available for end-users. It contains a unique and substantial collection of time series with standardized species names, reporting units, fishing areas and ports of landing (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010b). It is a ‘living’ product in the sense that new, relevant, quality-controlled time-series can be added as they are discovered or produced. Considering the relative size of the fleet, the short coastline and the limited number of fish auctions and fishing ports in Belgium, it is fair to say that the present reconstruction of Belgian sea fisheries depicts a relatively complete picture of historical volume, value and composition of landings, fleet dynamics, fishing effort and spatial dynamics. The project and its methodology offer a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The reconstructed time-series indicate that, since the onset of systematic reporting mechanisms in Belgium in 1929, landings reported by the Belgian sea fisheries both in foreign and in Belgian ports amounted to 3.3 million tonnes (t). After a maximum of 80,000 t in 1947, annual landings declined steadily to only 26% of this peak by 2008 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The most important species over the observed period in terms of landings were cod (17% of all landings) and herring (16%), closely followed by plaice (14%), sole (8%), whiting (6%) and rays (6%). In terms of economic value and based on values corrected for inflation, sole (31%) and cod (15%) were the most valuable, closely followed by plaice (11%), brown shrimp (5%), rays (5%) and turbot (3%). Near to 73% of all landings originated from 5 of the 31 fishing areas. Twenty percent of all landings originated from the ‘coastal waters’, while these waters contributed nearly 60% of all landed pelagic species and 55% of all landed ‘molluscs and crustaceans’. The North Sea (south) and the Iceland Sea were next in importance with 17% and 16% of all landings respectively. The eastern and western part of the central North Sea, contributed each with approximately 10% of the total landings (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The Belgian fisheries have followed a development of 3 major successive exploitation phases in which 3 major target species or target species groups were exploited until events or processes triggered a transition to a new phase: a ‘herring’ period between 1929 and 1950, a ‘cod’ (and other gadoid and roundfish) period between 1950 and 1980 and a period marked by plaice/sole between 1980 and 2000 (and after). This successive exploitation of targeted species was also associated with exploited fishing grounds, successively the Coastal waters for herring, the Icelandic Sea for cod, the North Sea south and the North Sea central (east and west) for sole/plaice, later also complemented by the ‘western waters’ (English Channel, Bristol Channel, Irish Sea) for the flatfish fisheries. To understand and interpret the trends in landings and changes in target species (groups), it is crucial to look at trends and changes in the fishing fleet and the fishing sector inserted in a wider socio-economic and political context. In the present thesis work, a reconstruction was made of the fleet size (from 1830), tonnage (from 1842) and engine power (kW from 1912) of the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. The time-series show a 85% decrease in fleet size and a 5% decrease in overall engine power (kW) since WWII. This decrease was compensated by a 10-fold increase in average tonnage (GT) per vessel and a 6-fold increase in average engine power (kW) per vessel. In only 10 years time after WWII, the fleet size decreased from approximately 550 to 450 vessels in 1955 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). Between 1955 and 1970 major structural changes took place in the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. These changes were driven first by the shift in the main fishing activities towards Icelandic waters in the 1950s and in the early 1960s by the governmental subsidies for the purchase of new steel hulled medium-sized motor trawlers and the introduction of the beam-trawl (Poppe 1977, Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). This led to less but more powerful vessels: between 1960 and 1975 the fleet size declined from 430 to approximately 250 vessels (-42%). The decline in fleet size was exacerbated when Iceland demarcated its territorial waters from 12 nm to 50 nm in 1972 and when the presence of Belgian fishermen within the declared 200 nm EEZ of Icelandic waters became subject to a ‘phase-out’ in 1975 (Lescrauwaet et al. under review). As a consequence of the loss of the Icelandic waters towards 1980, Belgian vessels shifted their activities again towards the central part of the North Sea (Omey 1982) and - to a lesser extent - towards the English Channel, Bristol Channel, South and West Ireland and the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards specific programmes were oriented to the decommissioning of ships with the aim to reduce fleet capacity. In 2012, the Belgian commercial sea fishing fleet counted 86 ships, with a total engine capacity of 49,135 kW and gross tonnage of 15,326 GT (Roegiers et al. 2013). The reconstructed time-series suggest that total landings decreased with total fleet size and with total fishing effort. At the level of the Belgian fleet, the total number of days spent at sea decreased from approximately 91,800 days in 1938 to 15,100 days in 2010 (-84%). The landings (kg) per vessel per day at sea or per day fishing have doubled between 1938 and 2010. The time-series shows at least 4 successive events: a first event (1939-1945) marked by WWII and the increased landings of herring in coastal waters. The exceptionally high landings per unit of effort are partly explained by the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the North Sea during WWII combined with the effects of two strong year classes. The second period is situated in 1951-1955 and coincides with the steep increase in landings from Icelandic waters. Thirdly, an increase in landings is observed between 1960 and 1967, which coincides with the state subsidies to introduce the beam trawl firstly in shrimp vessels (1959-1960) and later for flatfish fisheries. A final conspicuous event concerns the period of increased levels of landings per vessel per day between 1977 and 1986. After standardization as landings per unit of installed power (LPUP) to account for the average increase (x6) of engine power per vessel, the landings have decreased by 74% from an average 1,3 t /installed kW in 1944-1947 to 0,38 t /installed kW in 2009-2010. Interestingly, the average price of landings (all species, all areas , all fisheries aggregated) is negatively correlated with the decreasing fishing effort and decrease in overall landings. This suggests that the Belgian sea fisheries compensated for the losses by targeting species that achieve better market prices. Although the LPUP are illustrative of the changes in the productivity of fisheries, they cannot be interpreted as a proxy of change in biomass of commercial fish stocks, because the Belgian fisheries have targeted different species and fishing areas over time. Trend analysis to study change in fish stocks must be conducted at the level of different métiers or fisheries, taking into account issues such as specificity and selectivity of gear, environmental conditions in the targeted fishing area, seasonality of fishing and behavior of target species. In the present thesis, a closer look was taken at the impact of sea fisheries. In a first part, a quantitative approach was taken to reconstruct total removals by Belgian sea fisheries by including the unreported and misreported landings of commercial and recreational fishing, as well as an estimation of discards. The methodology applied in this reconstruction can serve as a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The results are useful to inform current policy issues and societal challenges. This reconstruction covers 6 fisheries with historical or current importance for Belgium (Lescrauwaet et al. 2013). Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. During the WWII, the Belgian fisheries benefited a 10-fold increase in catches and 5-fold increase in LPUE of North Sea ‘Downs’ herring. In the present thesis, these increased catches were explained by the combined effects of a major increase in catch power after WWI, the effects of the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the central part of the North Sea and by the effects of strong pre-WWII year classes (Lescrauwaet et al. revised manuscript under review). A third subchapter focused on the otter trawl fishery in Icelandic waters targeting cod. This fishery was of great economic importance in Belgium but decreased with the ‘cod wars’ (1958 and 1972) coming finally to a complete end in 1996. While the decline in total landings from Icelandic waters started after Iceland expanded its EEZ in 1958, the fishing effort of the Belgian fleet continued to increase until a peak was reached in 1963. The results show that the decline in the Iceland cod stock was visible at different levels; the decrease in the proportional importance of cod in the overall landings, the 75% decrease in the LPUE (1946-1983), the decline in the proportion of ‘large’ fishes, and finally the decline or shift in the definition of a ‘large’ specimen. As a result of this thesis, unique data are presented on the trends in volume and composition of landings for the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS). The waters of the BNS are considered as the most important fishing area in terms of source of food for local population, but also as the most stable provider of food. The BNS and in particular the ecosystem of shallow underwater sandbanks is also important as (post)spawning and nursery area (Leloup and Gilis 1961, Gilis 1961, Leloup and Gilis 1965, Rabaut et.al 2007). The HiFiDatabase broadens the historical view on fisheries and serves as a basis for a range of potential research, management applications, and in support of policy-making. In particular, the time-series provide unique historical reference conditions of fishing in the Belgian part of the North Sea and a potential baseline for fisheries management in territorial waters or for the coastal fisheries. The latter is useful in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Habitat Directive and the proposal for Maritime Spatial Planning on the Belgian part of the North Sea. Finally in the present thesis work, important efforts were dedicated to approach the history of fisheries from different disciplines of work. The results underline the importance of collecting economic data, inventorying historical archives and historical legislation, historical economy and politics, in order to improve the interpretation and analysis of results. As advocated by the current integrated policies for the marine environment, both the challenge of the task and the richness of the results rely on a multidisciplinary approach.

The integration of historical time series on the landings and value of landings of Belgian sea fisheries, by fishing area, allows for a spatial analysis of broad-scaled historical preference of different Belgian fisheries for specific fishing areas. It documents changes in the relative importance of fishing areas for the Belgian fisheries as well as changes in composition of landings from within fishing areas over 8 decades (1929-2009) and underlines the historical importance of the 'coastal waters' to the Belgian fisheries. Finally, qualitative and quantitative statements about the spatial dynamics of Belgian fisheries in published sources are validated and, where not supported by our data, challenged.

However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems must be based on total removals, so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. Total removals by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929-2010 were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million tonnes (t) publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. The reconstructed total removals on the BNS were estimated to be 55% higher than the 0.8million t publicly reported over this period. In terms of percentages, discards on the BNS represent an average annual of 34% over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000s, approximately 50% of all Belgian removals from the BNS are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (<12m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical total removals for Belgium’s sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives.

In order to protect the Belgian coastline against erosion and coastal flooding on a short and long term basis (up to 2050), the Belgian sandy beaches face a multitude of beach nourishment activities over the next years. This soft coastal defence measure safeguards the natural dynamics of the coast and has little impact on the beach ecology and tourism compared to other options. However, together with the multitude of human beach functions such as tourism and economic development, beach nourishment potentially threatens the natural balance of the beach and coastal ecosystem.

The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao’s Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites (‘community evenness’), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.","Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Bates, A.E.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Duffy, E.; Baker, S.C.; Thomson, R.J.; Stuart-Smith, J.F.; Hill, N.A.; Kininmoth, S.J.; Airoldi, L.; Becerro, M.A.; Campbell, S.J.; Dawson, T.P.; Navarrete, S.A.; Soler, G.A.; Strain, E.M.A.; Willis, T.J.; Edgar, G.J.",WOS:000324826300056,"Becerro, Mikel, M.A.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/nature12529,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Environmental Managers &amp; Monitoring"", ""Exploitable Scientific Result"", ""Marine Sciences"", ""Policy Makers / Decision Makers"", ""Scientific Community"", ""Scientific Publication""",NULL,Biodiversity      Conservation      Macroecology      Food webs ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, we analyzed data obtained from 147 instrumented pelagic longline sets equipped with hook timers and temperature depth recorders to characterize the distribution of hooking contacts and success at a fine temporal and spatial scale.

Five of the samples were from either the type locality of a nominal species or a close nearby locality (<i>O. edwardsii</i> from Corsica, <i>O. carmelae</i> and <i>O. piantonii</i> from the Kerkennah Islands, <i>O. hispidula</i> from the Gulf of Gabès and <i>O. leukos</i> from the Canary Islands), one from the inferred original locality (<i>O. ingloria</i> from Venice Lagoon), and specimens assigned in the recent literature to <i>O. nicolai</i>.

Many scientific projects and initiatives published information on species and biodiversity on the World Wide Web without users needing to pay for it. However, these resources often stagnated when project funding expired. Based on a large pool of experiences worldwide, this article discusses what measures will help such data resources develop beyond the project lifetime.Biodiversity data, just as data in many other disciplines, are often not generated automatically by machines or sensors. Data on for example species are based on human observations and interpretation. This requires continuous data curation to keep these up to date. Creators of online biodiversity databases should consider whether they have the resources to make their database of such value that other scientists and/or institutions would continue to finance its existence. To that end, it may be prudent to engage such partners in the development of the resource from an early stage. Managers of existing biodiversity databases should reflect on the factors being important for sustainability. These include the extent, scope, quality and uniqueness of database content; track record of development; support from scientists; support from institutions, and clarity of Intellectual Property Rights. Science funders should give special attention to the development of scholarly databases with expert-validated content. The science community has to become aware of the efforts of scientists in contributing to open-access databases, including by citing these resources in the Reference lists of publications that use them. Science culture must thus adapt its practices to support online databases as scholarly publications.To sustain such databases, we recommend they should (a) become integrated into larger collaborative databases or information systems with a consequently larger user community and pool of funding opportunities, and (b) be owned and curated by a science organisation, society, or institution with a suitable mandate. Good governance and proactive communication with contributors is important to maintain the team enthusiasm that launched the resource. Experience shows that ‘bigger is better’ in terms of database size because the resource will have more content, more potential and known uses and users of its content, more contributors, be more prestigious to contribute to, and have more funding options. Furthermore, most successful biodiversity databases are managed by a partnership of individuals and organisations.","Costello, M.J.; Appeltans, W.; Bailly, N.; Berendsohn, W.G.; de Jong, Y.; Edwards, M.; Froese, R.; Huettmann, F.; Los, W.; Mees, J.; Segers, H.; Bisby, F.A.",WOS:000336874100018,"de Jong, Yde, Y.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.042,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Funding, ""Intellectual property"", ""Publications"", ""Species"", ""Taxonomy""",NULL,Citation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARs.","Reubens, J.; De Rijcke, M.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.",WOS:000329884700021,"De Rijcke, Maarten, M.","Ghent University, Biology Department, Marine Biology Section",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2013.05.005,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,Gadus morhua,NULL,NULL,    Diel Activity;     Gadus morhua;     Feeding;     Artificial Hard Substrates;     Offshore Wind Farms,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Three main regions, the Baltic Sea (BS), the North Sea and English Channel (NS), and the Bay of Biscay (BB), were tested for possible geographic (latitudinal) differences in the SI values. In spring, only BS showed lower delta C-13 values of seston and Mytilus spp., and higher delta N-15 values of SOM, than NS and BB. No significant differences between the 3 regions were found in autumn. Irrespective of season and regions, Mytilus spp. was more C-13-depleted than M. balthica. delta C-13 values of M. balthica, but not those of Mytilus spp., were significantly correlated with SOM. These results are consistent with differences in feeding behavior of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica, as the two species are known as obligatory-suspension and facultative-deposit feeders, respectively. In contrast, no differences in the delta N-15 values of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica were found at individual stations, indicating the same trophic level of the two bivalves within the food webs. At some stations, irrespective of geographic location, both bivalves showed delta N-15 values up to 18-20 aEuro degrees. These were two trophic levels higher than those found at the other stations, indicating local and/or episodic eutrophic conditions, probably due to waste water discharge, and the effectiveness of both Mytilus spp. and M. balthica as bio-indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication. Overall, our results suggest that pathways of energy flow from OM pools to dominant bivalves is more related to local environmental conditions than to geographic regions across the European coastline. This has implications for food web studies along the Atlantic coast because most of the values are consistent over a large area and show no significant differences. Therefore, the present study can be used twofold for the determination of trophic baselines and for the correction of the trophic position of consumers higher up in the food web in the case of differences in waste water discharge.","Magni, P.; Rajagopal, S.; Como, S.; Jansen, J.M.; van der Velde, G.; Hummel, H.",WOS:000315275400006,"Hummel, H.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2110-7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Archaeal abundance was similar between sponge species, while bacterial abundance was higher in H. caerulea than in N. nodastrella and H. thielei. Q-PCR showed that AOA outnumbered AOB by a factor of 2 to 35, suggesting a larger role of AOA than of AOB in ammonia oxidation in sponges. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to analyse the taxonomic affiliation of the microbial community associated with these sponges. Archaeal and bacterial amoA genes were found in all 3 sponges. The structure of the phylogenetic trees in relation to temperature and sponge species was analysed using all published amoA sequences retrieved from sponges. Temperature was an important factor influencing the distribution of nitrifiers in sponges. Both archaeal and bacterial amoA sponge sequences tended to cluster with sequences retrieved from habitats of similar temperature. This is the first time that similarity in AOB diversity is described between distantly related species (H. thielei belonging to the class Demospongiae, and N. nodastrella to Hexactinellida).

It was therefore surprising that in a ciliate-contaminated experiment the growth rate of the phytoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi was significantly reduced. As U. marinum does not ingest E. huxleyi cells, their growth inhibition was probably caused by a toxin secreted by the ciliate, presumably a novel type of chemical interaction between ciliates and phytoplankton. A possible function of toxin secretion is to lyse algal cells that are too large for U. marinum to ingest, to increase dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and hence the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, the main food source of U. marinum. To test this hypothesis U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures was added to cultures of phytoplankton with different cell sizes. The presence of U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures showed an inhibiting growth effect and a negative effect on the physiology of all species tested although both effects were variable between species. Diatoms appeared less sensitive than non-diatom species. U. marinum acclimatization to phytoplankton led to stronger inhibiting effects, presumably from increased toxin production. Bacterial DGGE analysis of U. marinum cultures did not reveal known toxic bacteria that might account for the observed negative effects on the phytoplankton. Bacterial growth rates in an E. huxleyi culture increased when U. marinum filtrate had been added.

Abundance and classical species diversity indices (S, H', J) of macrofaunal communities were related to principal attributes of food webs (relative trophic level and food chain length, FCL) that were determined from carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values. Structure of marine macrobenthos varies substantially at a geographical scale; total abundance ranges from 63 ind. m(-2) to 34,517 ind. m(-2), species richness varies from 3 to 166 and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index from 0.26 to 3.26 while Pielou's evenness index is below 0.73. The major source of energy for macrobenthic communities is suspended particulate organic matter, consisting of phytoplankton and detrital particles, sediment particulate organic matter, and microphytobenthos in varying proportions. These food sources support the presence of suspension- and deposit-feeding communities, which dominate numerically on the sea floor. Benthic food webs include usually four to five trophic levels (FCL varies from 3.08 to 4.86). Most species are assigned to the second trophic level (primary consumers), fewer species are grouped in the third trophic level (secondary consumers), and benthic top predators are the least numerous. Most species cluster primarily at the lowest trophic level that is consistent with the typical organization of pyramidal food webs. Food chain length increases with biodiversity, highlighting a positive effect of more complex community structure on food web organisation. In more diverse benthic communities, energy is transferred through more trophic levels while species-poor communities sustain a shorter food chain.","Sokolowski, A.; Wolowicz, M.; Asmus, H.; Asmus, R.; Carlier, A.; Gasiunaité, Z.; Grémare, A.; Hummel, H.; Lesutiené, J.; Razinkovas, A.; Renaud, P.E.; Richard, P.; Kędra, M.",WOS:000307610900009,"Sokolowski, A.","University of Gda?nsk, Institute of Oceanography",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.011,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,macrobenthic communities; biodiversity; food web structure;diversity-structure interactions; European waters,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Compared to most other phyla, phylogenetic relationships among sponges are still largely unresolved. In the past 10 years, the classical taxonomy has been completely overturned and a review of the state of the art appears necessary. The field of taxonomy remains a prominent discipline of sponge research and studies related to sponge systematics were in greater number in the Eighth World Sponge Conference (Girona, Spain, September 2010) than in any previous world sponge conferences. To understand the state of this rapidly growing field, this chapter proposes to review studies, mainly from the past decade, in sponge taxonomy, nomenclature and phylogeny. In a first part, we analyse the reasons of the current success of this field. In a second part, we establish the current sponge systematics theoretical framework, with the use of (1) cladistics, (2) different codes of nomenclature (Phylo-Code vs. Linnaean system) and (3) integrative taxonomy. Sponges are infamous for their lack of characters. However, by listing and discussing in a third part all characters available to taxonomists, we show how diverse characters are and that new ones are being used and tested, while old ones should be revisited. We then review the systematics of the four main classes of sponges (Hexactinellida, Calcispongiae, Homoscleromorpha and Demospongiae), each time focusing on current issues and case studies. We present a review of the taxonomic changes since the publication of the Systema Porifera (2002), and point to problems a sponge taxonomist is still faced with nowadays. To conclude, we make a series of proposals for the future of sponge systematics. In the light of recent studies, we establish a series of taxonomic changes that the sponge community may be ready to accept. We also propose a series of sponge new names and definitions following the PhyloCode. The issue of phantom species (potential new species revealed by molecular studies) is raised, and we show how they could be dealt with. Finally, we present a general strategy to help us succeed in building a Porifera tree along with the corresponding revised Porifera classification.","Cardenas, P.; Perez, T.; Boury-Esnault, N.",WOS:000308193900003,"Cardenas, Paco, P.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Milieux & Peuplements Aquat, BOrEA UMR 7208, F-75231 Paris, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-387787-1.00010-6,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Calcispongiae, ""Demospongiae"", ""Hexactinellida"", ""Homoscleromorpha""","Cladistics, ""Classification"", ""Phylogeny""",NULL,Integrative taxonomy;  PhyloCode; Linnaean system; Calcispongiae,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

Since its founding in the early 1970s, the programme has been dedicated to a detailed multidisciplinary study of a section of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the Atlantic's largest reef complex, and has generated data far beyond the capability of lone investigators and brief expeditions. This reef complex extends 250 km southward from Yucatan, Mexico, into the Gulf of Honduras, most of it lying 20-40 km off the coast of Belize. A relatively unspoiled ecosystem, it features a great variety of habitats in close proximity, ranging from mangrove islands, seagrass meadows, and patch reefs in its lagoon to the barrier reef along the margin of the continental shelf. Among its varied macrobenthos, sponges stand out for their ubiquity, range of colours, rich species and biomass, and ecological importance; they populate rocky substrates, some sandy bottoms, and the subtidal stilt roots and peat banks of mangroves. Working from a field station established in 1972 on Carrie Bow Cay, a sand islet atop the reef off southern Belize, experts in numerous disciplines from both the Museum and academic institutions throughout the world have explored the area's biodiversity in the broadest sense and community development over time. At last count, 113 researchers (88 working on site) have focused on the biological and geological role of Porifera in Carrie Bow's reef communities, with the results reported in 125 scientific papers to date. The majority of these sponge studies have centred on systematics and faunistics, including quantitative distribution among the various habitats. Taxonomic approaches have ranged from basic morphology to fine structure, DNA barcoding, and ecological manipulations and culminated in a mini-workshop involving several experts on Caribbean Porifera. Ecological work has covered a broad spectrum as well: bioerosion, silica and nutrient cycling, symbiosis, mutualism, space competition, predation, disease, and the effects on sponge individuals and populations of environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity, desiccation, substrate, and sedimentation. Many projects were enhanced by scientific illustration, laboratory studies of larvae settlement preferences and development, and investigations of microbial and invertebrate sponge associates, notably symbiotic cyanobacteria, parazoanthid epizoans, and crustacean and ophiuroid endobionts. Of the striking discoveries, the work on alpheid shrimps colonizing sponges off Carrie Bow Cay has yielded the first report of eusociality in marine organisms.","Rützler, K.",WOS:000308193900004,"Rützler, Klaus, K.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-387787-1.00002-7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Bioerosion, ""Coral reefs"", ""Diseases"", ""Ecology"", ""Mangroves"", ""Reproduction"", ""Silicon cycle"", ""Systematics""",NULL,Species interaction; Seagrass meadow,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

A detailed examination of the feeding ecology of pelagic fish can provide valuable insights in the causes and consequences of these phenomena. The present study investigated the diets of both juvenile and adult herring, sprat, horse mackerel, and adult mackerel in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) in relation to the distribution of zooplankton and ambient abiotic conditions. A study sampling pelagic fish and zooplankton simultaneously every month during consecutive years, and spanning nearshore to offshore sampling locations, is unprecedented in the southern North Sea. In all, 71 prey taxa were found in 725       stomachs of fish gathered at ten stations, sampled monthly in 2009 and 2010. The proportion of fish with empty stomachs was    low (11%), and the number of prey species ranged from 0 to 21 sp. per stomach. The diet of herring and sprat was dominated         by calanoid copepods, but herring stomachs also contained many decapod larvae, amphipods, cumaceans, and mysids. Mackerel       added sandeels to an otherwise planktivorous diet. Horse mackerel consumed both benthic and pelagic prey. The highest frequency     of occurrence in the stomachs was observed for the calanoid copepods <em>Temora longicornis</em> (33 408 of all 55 004 prey items identified) and <em>Centropages hamatus</em> (5003 times found). The fullness index ranged between 0 and 20.6, and averaged highest for sprat (0.86), followed by herring           (0.60), horse mackerel (0.26), and mackerel (0.24). We observed a different composition of zooplankton species and life stages      in the plankton samples compared with those in the fish stomachs. More adult and female copepods were eaten than the plankton       samples would suggest. Also, the calanoid copepod <em>Acartia clausi</em>, the most common calanoid species in the BPNS, was barely eaten, as was the case for fish eggs and larvae, and for common planktonic species known to be preyed upon elsewhere (e.g. <em>Oikopleura dioica</em>, <em>Evadne nordmanni</em>,  em>Euterpina acutifrons</em>). Additionally, plankton densities averaged highest in spring and at midshore (20–30 km from shore) stations, but fullness index was highest nearshore (<12 km from shore) and (apart from sprat) in summer. A significant correlation between fullness index and total density of planktonic prey species was not observed, indicating that zooplankton densities were not restrictive. Yet the fact that more than 100 plankton species occurred in the plankton samples and just two of these (<em>T. longicornis</em> and <em>C. hamatus</em>) accounted for nearly three-quarters of all ingested prey items leads us to conclude that even minor changes in the ecology or phenology of these dominant zooplankters could have profound effects on pelagic fish stocks.

The species has a broad range in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, although it is possible that small or isolated patches of suitable habitat may not be occupied due to restrictions on larval supply. Nephrops densities are related to the silt-clay content of sediments, with interactions between habitat quality and density indicating competition for resources. An analysis of density-size interactions across fishery functional management units (FUs) suggests that growth is suppressed at high densities due to competition (e. g. in the western Irish Sea), although recruitment dynamics or size-selective mortality may also shape the size structure of populations. Nephrops biomass available across FUs may be similar, reflecting a constant yield due to the inverse relationship between individual size and population density. Gaps in the understanding of Nephrops' ecology reflect uncertain ageing criteria, reliance on fisheries-dependent data and few if any undisturbed habitats in which to examine fisheries-independent interactions.","Johnson, M.P.; Lordan, C.; Power, A.M.",WOS:000321561100003,"Johnson, Mark, M.P.","Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst Environm Marine & Energy Res, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-410466-2.00002-9,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,"Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758)","Catchability, ""Density"", ""Distribution"", ""Growth"", ""Sediments""",NULL,Ecosystem functions; Fishery interactions; Catch,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

Selective settlement of deep-sea and intertidal meiofauna - an experimental approach. MSc Thesis. Ghent University, Marine Biology Research Group: Gent.  31 pp.","The cosmopolitan distribution of many meiofaunal organisms raises questions about the dispersal mechanisms of these animals. Their small size and the lack of a planktonic life stage in many taxa suggest that passive dispersal is the main factor determining distribution and colonization patterns. This study investigates the settling behaviour of meiofauna while descending in a water column. Two ex-situ settling experiments were conducted with (1) macrophyte associated meiofauna from an intertidal flat and (2) meiofauna of microbial mat sediments from the deep-sea Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV). Containers (126L) filled with sieved seawater were used as settling chambers and five different substrates, placed on the bottom of the vessels, were offered to the descending meiofaunal assemblage. The substrates used <i>Fucus spiralis</i>, sulfidic agar medium, bare agar and an empty Petri dish. For the deepsea experiment azoic sediment with algae, azoic sediment with bacteria, a sulfidic medium, azoic sediment and an empty Petri dish were used. The experiments were run for 12 hours. Significant differences in meiofaunal densities between the treatments were found in both experiments. Nematode and nauplius larvae showed fourfold higher densities in the Fucus treatment compared to the controls in the case of the intertidal experiment. Deep-sea nematodes and harpacticoid copepods in the sulfide treatment differed by a factor of five from all other treatments in terms of densities. Proportions of harpacticoid copepods were increased in the treatments compared to the reference sample. Nematode assemblages in the treatments showed no significant differences to the reference samples. These findings suggest that meiofauna can selectively settle once they are suspended in the water column and therefore actively contribute to their dispersal. In both experiments meiofauna was increased in substrates similar to their original habitat and proportional differences in harpacticoid copepods suggests a more efficient settlement compared to nematodes. The observed active settling behaviour may be very advantageous for the organisms in finding suitable habitat patches in heterogeneous environments. This study confirms previous research and adds important information to the understanding of meiofaunal dispersal mechanisms.","Mevenkamp, L.",NULL,"Mevenkamp, Lisa, L.","Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology, Research Group Marine Biology",NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Deep sea, ""Meiofauna""",NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

This paper provides a preliminary overview of the meiofauna and nematodes inhabiting coral sediments in the outer reef and lagoon habitats of the Maldives, and investigates their relationships with micro-habitat type. The abundance and community structure of the meiofauna and nematodes reveal significant differences between stations. Coral fragments and rubble from the outer reefs seem to act as a trap for the finest sediment, which might contribute to creating a heterogeneous micro-habitat suitable for both epifaunal (Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae genera) and sediment-dwelling (<em class=""a-plus-plus"">Tricoma</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Richtersia</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Ptycholaimellus</em> and <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Molgolaimus</em>) taxa. On the other side, the lagoon’s sediments are mainly colonized by dwelling taxa, probably due to the low-flow regime that enhances the deposition of organic matter and pelite fractions. A high level of diversity was recorded in both the habitats studied. Among the factors that probably determine the high diversity in the lagoon is the presence of small biogenic structures. These are characterized by a high degree of angularity, which might add more complexity to the habitat. The nematodes reveal an overlap in the taxonomic composition between the Maldives and other geographically distant areas, possibly supporting the existence of iso-communities that are typical of the coral degradation zone. Nematode trophic composition reflects differences in availability of food resources; epigrowth and non-selective deposit feeders are dominant in the lagoon, while selective deposit and epistrate feeders are dominant in the outer reefs.","Semprucci, F.; Colantoni, P.; Baldelli, G.; Sbrocca, C.; Rocchi, M.; Balsamo, M.",WOS:000323258000005,"Semprucci, F.","Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Sci Terra Vita & Ambiente DiSTeVA, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-013-0146-7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Maldive I.,NULL,"Meiofauna, ""Nematodes""",NULL,Subtidal habitats; Habitat heterogeneity; Coral sediments,Journal article,NULL,NULL

MPAs often fail to reach their full potential as a consequence of factors such as illegal harvesting, regulations that legally allow detrimental harvesting, or emigration of animals outside boundaries because of continuous habitat or inadequate size of reserve. Here we show that the conservation benefits of 87 MPAs investigated worldwide increase exponentially with the accumulation of five key features: no take, well enforced, old (> 10 years), large (> 100 km<sup>2</sup>), and isolated by deep water or sand. Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large (> 250 mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59%) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites. Our results show that global conservation targets based on area alone will not optimize protection of marine biodiversity. More emphasis is needed on better MPA design, durable management and compliance to ensure that MPAs achieve their desired conservation value.","Edgar, G.J.; Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Willis, T.J.; Kininmonth, S.; Baker, S.C.; Banks, S.; Barrett, N.S.; Becerro, M.A.; Bernard, A.T.F.; Berkhout, J.; Buxton, C.D.; Campbell, S.J.; Cooper, A.T.; Davey, M.; Edgar, S.C.; Försterra, G.; Galván, D.E.; Irigoyen, A.J.; Kushner, D.J.; Moura, R.; Parnell, P.E.; Shears, N.T.; Soler, G.; Strain, E.M.A.; Thomson, R.J.",WOS:000331107700037,"Berkhout, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/nature13022,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,"Environmental Management, ""Environmental Managers &amp; Monitoring"", ""Environmental Resources Management"", ""Exploitable Scientific Result"", ""Fisheries Management"", ""Policy Makers / Decision Makers"", ""Scientific Community"", ""Scientific Publication""",NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

From 2009 until 2012 the behavioural ecology of Atlantic cod and pouting was investigated at WARs in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS). Information on length-frequency distribution, diet, community structure and movements were combined to gain insights on the behavioural ecology and to unravel whether production occurs. We demonstrated that specific age groups of Atlantic cod and pouting are seasonally attracted towards the WARs, that they show high site fidelity and feed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present. Growth was observed throughout the period the fishes were present. Production on a local scale can be assumed. On a regional scale however, no changes were observed yet. Based on the acquired knowledge we judged that no fisheries activities should be allowed inside the offshore wind farms in the BPNS.","Reubens, J.T.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.",WOS:000330967900009,"Vincx, Magda, M.","Marine Biology Research Group, Department of Biology, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-013-1793-1,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,"Gadus morhua, ""Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758"", ""Trisopterus luscus""",NULL,NULL,Atlantic cod; Benthopelagic fish; Offshore wind farm; Pouting; Reef effects; Windmill artificial reef  ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The focus of protection has been primarily on critical marine habitats and ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on maintaining and improving the status of near-shore fisheries, a primary food and economic resource in the region. This article brings together for the first time a consistent set of current data on MPAs for the six countries and reviews progress toward the establishment of MPAs in these countries with regard to (i) coverage of critical habitat (e.g., 17.8% of the coral reef habitat within the region lies within an MPA), (ii) areas under effective management, and (iii) actions needed to improve the implementation of MPAs as a marine conservation and resource management strategy. The contribution of MPAs to the Coral Triangle MPA System as called for in the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security Regional Plan of Action is clarified. Options for scaling up existing MPAs to networks of MPAs that are more ecologically linked and integrated with fisheries management and responsive to changing climate through the Coral Triangle MPA System development are discussed.

After a discussion of theoretical approaches to regulatory capture, I describe the operative definition and theory appropriate to the situation related to authorization of oil and natural gas production in Israel following the discovery of large offshore reserves in 2010. This approach, embodying several facets of existing typologies, is applied to decisions made authorizing construction of the Gabriella offshore exploratory drilling platform. The analysis highlights the nature of capture in the absence of clear agency jurisdiction over new activities located in offshore environs organized as temporal and spatial “vacuums”. I conclude that comprehensive marine spatial planning would result in less capture and the development of more capture-resistant regulations.","Portman, M.E.",WOS:000330813800005,"Portman, Michelle, M.E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.010,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Regulatory capture;  Offshore gas drilling; Temporal and spatial vacuums;  Marine spatial planning,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Using new and already published data, the meiofauna standing stocks (abundance and biomass) and nematode structural and functional diversity were investigated in relation to the sediment biogeochemistry (e.g. organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments) and grain size. A conspicuous increase in sand content from 2005 to 2006 and decrease of phytodetritus at both sites, suggested the occurrence of one or more physical disturbance events. Nematode standing stocks and trophic diversity decreased after these events, seemingly followed by a recovery/recolonisation period in 2007, which was strongly correlated with an increase in the quantity and bioavailability of phytodetrital organic matter supplied. Changes in meiofauna assemblages, however, also differed between stations, likely because of the contrasting hydrodynamic and food supply conditions.

Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BP<sub>c</sub>).

The knowledge of the spatial variability of deep-sea biodiversity is one of the main challenges of marine ecology and evolutionary biology. The choice of the observational spatial scale is assumed to play a key role for understanding processes structuring the deep-sea benthic communities and one of the most typical features of marine biodiversity distribution is the existence of bathymetric gradients. However, the analysis of biodiversity bathymetric gradients and the associated changes in species composition (beta diversity) typically compared large depth ranges (with intervals of 500 to 1000 or even 2000 m depth among sites). To test whether significant changes in alpha and beta diversity occur also at fine-scale bathymetric gradients (i.e., within few hundred-meter depth intervals) the variability of deep-sea nematode biodiversity and assemblage composition along a bathymetric transect (200-1200 m depth) with intervals of 200 m among sampling depths, was investigated. A hierarchical sampling strategy for the analysis of nematode species richness, beta diversity, functional (trophic) diversity, and related environmental variables, was used. The results indicate the lack of significant differences in taxonomic and functional diversity across sampling depths, but the presence of high beta diversity at all spatial scales investigated: between cores collected from the same box corer (on average 56%), among deployments at the same depth (58%), and between all sampling depths (62%). Such high beta diversity is influenced by the presence of small-scale patchiness in the deep sea and is also related to the large number of rare or very rare species (typically accounting for > 80% of total species richness). Moreover, the number of ubiquitous nematode species across all sampling depths is quite low (ca. 15%). Multiple regression analyses provide evidence that such patterns could be related to the different availability, composition and size spectra of food particles in the sediments. Additionally, though to a lesser extent, our results indicate, that selective predation can influence the nematode trophic composition. These findings suggest that a multiple scale analysis based on a nested sampling design could significantly improve our knowledge of bathymetric patterns of deepsea biodiversity and its drivers.","Danovaro, R.; Carugati, L.; Corinaldesi, C.; Gambi, C.; Guilini, K.; Pusceddu, A.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000321177000012,"Guilini, Katja, K.","Ghent University, Department Biology, Marine Biology Research Group",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.035,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nematoda,NULL,NULL,Deep-sea biodiversity; Bathymetric patterns; Deep-sea nematodes</td>,Journal article,NULL,NULL

It has been argued that as a result of nematodes being small in size and lacking pelagic larvae, it is unlikely that they are able to disperse actively over wide geographical ranges. Nematode dispersal is therefore assumed to be predominantly driven by water currents entraining resuspended sediments containing nematodes. Three different types of substrates combined with sediment (algae, bacteria, and sulphides) and two different controls (empty and azoic sediment) were offered to a nematode community sinking through the water column in three independent, simultaneously running replicated experiments. Selective settlement of nematodes was observed whilst descending in the water column under ex-situ experimental conditions using samples collected in the Whittard canyon at 812 m of water depth. Significant differences in nematode community structure between treatments suggest that different nematodes are attracted by different substrates. They may colonise suitable patches selectively when descending in the water column, but whether they are attracted by food or by other attractants, such as pheromones or other chemical signals, is still unclear. High abundances of the chemosynthetic, mouthless nematode <i>Astomonema</i> found in the canyon study area over medium-scale distances (10-100 m) contribute to the idea that resuspension events enable dispersal of nematodes over larger distances, after which active settlement can occur through chemical attraction.","Lins, L.; Vanreusel, A.; Van Campenhout, J.; Ingels, J.",WOS:000316715000015,"Ingels, Jeroen, J.","Marine Biology Department, Ghent University",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.01.021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nematoda,NULL,NULL,Deep sea; Nematodes; Resuspension; Settlement</td>,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We investigated the potential functions of startle effect (use of light to deter predator), use of light to advertise a predator that the prey is toxic (aposematic signal) and attraction of a secondary predator (function usually called ""burglar-alarm effect""). Predatory experiments, involving one or two predators from different trophic levels allowed us determining benefits of the light emission for several brittle star species.

For the deep sea, there is evidence that structural and functional characteristics of benthic communities are regulated by a multitude of biotic and environmental processes that act in concert on different spatial scales, but the spatial patterns are poorly understood compared to those for terrestrial ecosystems. Deep-sea studies generally focus on very limited scale ranges, thereby impairing our understanding of which spatial scales and associated processes are most important in driving structural and functional diversity of communities. Here, we used an extensive integrated dataset of free-living nematodes from deep-sea sediments to unravel the importance of different spatial scales in determining benthic infauna communities. Multiple-factor multivariate permutational analyses were performed on different sets of community descriptors (structure, structural and functional diversity, standing stock). The different spatial scales investigated cover two margins in the northeast Atlantic, several submarine canyons/channel/slope areas, a bathymetrical range of 700-4300 m, different sampling locations at each station, and vertical sediment profiles. The results indicated that the most important spatial scale for structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability is the smallest one; infauna communities changed substantially more with differences between sediment depth layers than with differences associated to larger geographical or bathymetrical scales. Community structure differences were greatest between stations at both margins. Important regulating ecosystem processes and the scale on which they occur are discussed. The results imply that, if we are to improve our understanding of ecosystem patterns of deep-sea infauna and the relevant processes driving their structure, structural and functional diversity, and standing stock, we must pay particular attention to the small-scale heterogeneity or patchiness and the causative mechanisms acting on that scale.","Ingels, J.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000322242700010,"Ingels, J.","Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-4547-2013,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In southern rockhopper penguins, <i>Eudyptes chrysocome</i>, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and time–depth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds' incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.","Ludynia, K.; Dehnhard, N.; Poisbleau, M.; Demongin, L.; Masello, J.F.; Voigt, C.C.; Quillfeldt, P.",WOS:000313573200033,"Ludynia, K.","Max Planck Inst Ornithol,Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Germany.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.11.001,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,Eudyptes chrysocome,NULL,NULL,ecological niche model; energetic requirement; Eudyptes chrysocome;Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas; GPS logger; MaxEnt; sex-specificbehaviour; southern rockhopper penguin; spatial segregation; stableisotope analysis,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The classification facilitates reporting of habitat data in a comparable manner, for use in nature conservation (e.g. inventories, monitoring and assessments), habitat mapping and environmental management. For the marine environment the importance of a univocal habitat classification system is confirmed by the fact that many European initiatives, aimed at marine mapping, assessment and reporting, are increasingly using EUNIS habitat categories and respective codes. For this reason substantial efforts have been made to include information on marine benthic habitats from different regions, aiming to provide a comprehensive geographical coverage of European seas. However, there still remain many concerns on its applicability as only a small fraction of Europe's seas are fully mapped and increasing knowledge and application raise further issues to be resolved.<br>This paper presents an overview of the main discussion and conclusions of a workshop, organised by the MeshAtlantic project, focusing upon the experience in using the EUNIS habitats classification across different countries and seas, together with case studies. The aims of the meeting were to: (i) bring together scientists with exper_ience_in the use of the EUNIS marine classification and representatives from the European Environment Agency (EEA); (ii) agree on enhancements to EUNIS that ensure an improved representation of the European marine habitats; and (iii) establish practices that make marine habitat maps produced by scientists more consistent with the needs of managers and decision-makers. During the workshop challenges for the future development of EUNIS were identified, which have been classified into five categories: (1) structure and hierarchy; (2) biology; (3) terminology; (4) mapping; and (5) future development. The workshop ended with a declaration from the attendees, with recommendations to the EEA and European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity, to take into account the outputs of the workshop, which identify weaknesses in the current classification and include proposals for its modification, and to devise a process to further develop the marine component of the EUNIS habitat classification.","Galparsoro, I.; Connor, D.W.; Borja, A.; Aish, A.; Amorim, P.; Bajjouk, T.; Chambers, C.; Coggan, R.; Dirberg, G.; Ellwood, H.; Evans, D.; Goodin, K.L.; Grehan, A.; Haldin, J.; Howell, K.; Jenkins, C.; Michez, N.; Mo, G.L.; Buhl-Mortensen, P.; Pearce, B.; Populus, J.; Salomidi, M.; Sanchez, F.; Serrano, A.; Shumchenia, E.; Tempera, F.; Vasquez, M.",WOS:000313380800016,"Galparsoro, I.","AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res,Portualdea Zg 20110, Pasaia, Spain.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.10.010,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Habitat classification scheme; EUNIS; Marine habitats; Habitat mapping</td>,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The complexity of the terebrid venom apparatus suggests that venom apparatus development in the Terebridae could be linked to the diversification of the group and can be analyzed within a molecular phylogenetic scaffold to better understand terebrid evolution. Presented here is a molecular phylogeny of 89 terebrid species belonging to 12 of the 15 currently accepted genera, based on Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses of amplicons of 3 mitochondrial (COI, 16S and 12S) and one nuclear (28S) genes. The evolution of the anatomy of the terebrid venom apparatus was assessed by mapping traits of six related characters: proboscis, venom gland, odontophore, accessory proboscis structure, radula, and salivary glands. A novel result concerning terebrid phylogeny was the discovery of a previously unrecognized lineage, which includes species of <i>Euterebra</i> and <i>Duplicaria</i>. The non-monophyly of most terebrid genera analyzed indicates that the current genus-level classification of the group is plagued with homoplasy and requires further taxonomic investigations. Foregut anatomy in the family Terebridae reveals an inordinate diversity of features that covers the range of variability within the entire superfamily Conoidea, and that hypodermic radulae have likely evolved independently on at least three occasions. These findings illustrate that terebrid venom apparatus evolution is not perfunctory, and involves independent and numerous changes of central features in the foregut anatomy. The multiple emergence of hypodermic marginal radular teeth in terebrids are presumably associated with variable functionalities, suggesting that terebrids have adapted to dietary changes that may have resulted from predator–prey relationships. The anatomical and phylogenetic results presented serve as a starting point to advance investigations about the role of predator–prey interactions in the diversification of the Terebridae and the impact on their peptide toxins, which are promising bioactive compounds for biomedical research and therapeutic drug development.","Castelin, M.; Puillandre, N.; Kantor, Y.I.; Modica, M.V.; Terryn, Y.; Cruaud, C.; Bouchet, P.; Holford, M.",WOS:000305035600003,"Castelin, M.","CUNY Hunter Coll, New York,NY 10065 USA.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2012.03.001,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Character evolution; Key innovations; Predator-prey system; Radula;Teretoxins; Peptide toxins,Journal article,NULL,NULL

These two case study areas lie next to each other and occupy around half of the total Belgian coastal zone. The Belgian coast is a densely populated and intensely used area due to its well-established infrastructure that makes the coast easily accessible for a broad (European) hinterland. Both the Belgian cases have a larger core and ring and are famous tourist attractions. While Brugge develops based on its two main pillars of multifunctional cargo port area and its touristic heritage, Oostende relies on strong beach tourism and a port as a passenger gateway. Both cases have witnessed their strong urbanization process decades ago and their development has become stabilized during the last decade. The economies rely more and more on commerce and service sector rather than traditional industrial activities. Agriculture has reduced to a marginal role, both in term of production and in term of employment. The major users include the local inhabitants, visitors, second-home owners, and various community groups. In Brugge, the port of Zeebrugge is one of the major users as it occupies a large area, which contains also valuable nature sites as well as important road, rail and waterway links to the hinterland. In Oostende, competition at the beachfront is one of the main issues. Generally ageing population, loss of agricultural lands, slight increase of mixed-use forest and nature areas, increase in port activities and urban sprawl are some of the trends observed in both cases. The scarcity of coastal space, and its contestation by a diversity of users for competing interests [mainly economic development and environmental protection] plays a pivotal role in generating a range of conflicts.","Le, Q.X.; De Munter, K.; Crols, T.; Khan, A.Z.; Corijn, E.",NULL,"Le, Quynh Xuan, Q.X.","COSMOPOLIS, Department of Geography, Vrije Universiteit Brussel",NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Brugge, Oostende, Belgian coastal areas, environmental characteristics, socioeconomic features, coastal users",Book chapters,NULL,NULL

It is the combination of a particular methodology, based on the minimisation of a cost function, and a numerically efficient method, based on a finite-element solver. The cost function penalises the misfit between the observations and the reconstructed field, as well as the regularity or smoothness of the field. The method bears similarities to the smoothing splines, where the second derivatives of the field are also penalised.<br>The intrinsic advantages of the method are its natural way to take into account topographic and dynamic constraints (coasts, advection, etc.) and its capacity to handle large data sets, frequently encountered in oceanography. The method provides gridded fields in two dimensions, usually in horizontal layers. Three-dimension fields are obtained by stacking horizontal layers.<br>In the present work, we summarize the background of the method and describe the possible methods to compute the error field associated to the analysis. In particular, we present new developments leading to a more consistent error estimation, by determining numerically the real covariance function in DIVA, which is never formulated explicitly, contrarily to Optimal Interpolation. The real covariance function is obtained by two concurrent executions of DIVA, the first providing the covariance for the second. With this improvement, the error field is now perfectly consistent with the inherent background covariance in all cases.<br>A two-dimension application using salinity measurements in the Mediterranean Sea is presented. Applied on these measurements, Optimal Interpolation and DIVA provided very similar gridded fields (correlation: 98.6%, RMS of the difference: 0.02).

Specifically at the beaches, predictions on sea-level rise, storms and flood risk from the North Sea have led to several big coastal defence projects. Management of sandy beaches is therefore a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined and where biodiversity should be taken into account.In this study, the biological value of the shallow Belgian coastal zone was derived based on a detailed and integrated dataset (1995–2011) of all available ecological information on macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos and birds. The 67 km Belgian coastline was divided into an across-shore intertidal and shallow subtidal subzone, and into along-shore subzones of 250 m for benthic components and 3 km for birds. The intrinsic biological value of each subzone was then calculated using the biological valuation method, and the pertained score, ranging from very low to very high, was plotted accordingly in order to obtain a marine biological valuation map.Following trends were detected: (1) a strong mosaic pattern of biological value along the coastline; (2) a clear lack of (benthic) data at the eastern part of the Belgian coast; (3) a rather high biological value in around 70% of the shallow subtidal subzones, compared to the intertidal part; and (4) a high/very high biological value in intertidal zones located immediately to the east of the harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende and Zeebrugge.A detailed analysis of protected areas and areas under coastal flood risk indicated that biological valuation maps are very promising management tools for local decision-makers as they allow for an early integration of ‘natural/ecological values’ in policy implementation.","Vanden Eede, S.; Laporta, L.; Deneudt, K.; Stienen, E.; Derous, S.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.",WOS:000339534800007,"Laporta, Lia, L.","Ghent University, Biology Department, Marine Biology Section",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.04.022,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Belgian Coast,NULL,Spatial planning,NULL,Marine spatial planning; biological valuation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Significant recent advances have been enabled by various factors, including the establishment of two IGCP projects and the realisation of several IODP expeditions. Contourites were first described in the Northern and Southern Atlantic Ocean, and since then, have been discovered in every major ocean basin and even in lakes. The 120 major contourite areas presently known are associated to myriad oceanographic processes in surface, intermediate and deep-water masses. The increasing recognition of these deposits is influencing palaeoclimatology & palaeoceanography, slope-stability/geological hazard assessment, and hydrocarbon exploration. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the sedimentological and oceanographic processes governing contourites, which involve dense bottom currents, tides, eddies, deep-sea storms, internal waves and tsunamis. Furthermore, in light of the latest knowledge on oceanographic processes and other governing factors (e.g. sediment supply and sea-level), existing facies models must now be revised. Persistent oceanographic processes significantly affect the seafloor, resulting in large-scale depositional and erosional features. Various classifications have been proposed to subdivide a continuous spectrum of partly overlapping features. Although much progress has been made in the large-scale, geophysically based recognition of these deposits, there remains a lack of unambiguous and commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for deciphering the small-scaled contourite facies and for distinguishing them from turbidite ones. Similarly, the study of sandy deposits generated or affected by bottom currents, which is still in its infancy, offers great research potential: these deposits might prove invaluable as future reservoir targets. Expectations for the forthcoming analysis of data from the IODP Expedition 339 are high, as this work promises to tackle much of the aforementioned lack of knowledge. In the near future, geologists, oceanographers and benthic biologists will have to work in concert to achieve synergy in contourite research to demonstrate the importance of bottom currents in continental margin sedimentation and evolution.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-SA license(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).","Rebesco, M.; Hernández-Molina, F.J.; Van Rooij, D.; Wåhlin, A.",WOS:000338802700008,"Van Rooij, D.","Ghent University, Renard Centre of Marine Geology, Geology & Soil Science",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.margeo.2014.03.011,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    contourite;     oceanographic process;     sedimentary drift;     bedform;     sedimentary structure;     facies model,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this review, we aimed to address the status of our knowledge for 3 major types of spatial information: bathymetry, classification of marine habitats, and species distributions. To exemplify the data gaps and approaches to bridge them, we examined case studies that systematically prioritize conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that at present the data required for conservation planning is generally more readily available and of better quality for the European countries located in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the Mediterranean Sea is lagging behind other marine regions where rigorous criteria for conservation planning has been applied in the past 20 yr. Therefore, we call upon scientists, governments, and international governmental and non-governmental organizations to harmonize current approaches in marine mapping and to develop a framework that is applicable throughout the Mediterranean region. Such coordination between stakeholders is urgently needed before more countries undertake further extensive habitat mapping, so that future conservation planning can use integrated spatial datasets.","Levin, N.; Coll, M.; Fraschetti, S.; Gal, G.; Giakoumi, S.; Göke, C.; Heymans, J.J.; Katsanevakis, S.; Mazor, T.; Öztürk, B.; Rilov, G.; Gajewski, J.; Steenbeek, J.; Kark, S.",WOS:000341168300020,"Coll, Marta, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps10857,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,NULL,"Bathymetry, ""Biodiversity"", ""Habitats"", ""Spatial data""",NULL, Conservation planning,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The first reserve was proposed in 1965 and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even one instance proves that such things are possible.    All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be expected.    Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs), cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long Bay).    Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both scientific theory and practical politics.    When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change, due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades. The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing directly and indirectly alters ecosystems.    The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to fishing and other human activities.    The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest.    The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining.    Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in Australia and the USA.

By doing so, they affect their own distribution and that of other species, which can influence community composition. Moreover, by affecting the abiotic environment and species distribution, ecosystem engineers can also affect the number and strength of biotic interactions among species, such as predation and competition. Together with the notion that engineering effects often persist on long time and large spatial scales, this leads to the suggestion that ecosystem engineers have the potential to alter the structure and dynamics of ecological interaction networks in space and time. In soft-bottom intertidal ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’ Arguin, the group of ecosystem engineers that provide structure such as reef-building bivalves and seagrasses, can have a significant impact on the associated community, since natural ‘hard’ substrate and structure are almost exclusively provided by these species in the otherwise sandy environment. Unfortunately, soft-bottom coastal ecosystems have become severely degraded worldwide during the last centuries due to human impacts and most ecosystem engineers in these systems have strongly declined, with potentially dramatic implications for associated species, community structure and overall biodiversity. The main objective of this thesis is to empirically investigate how and to what extent ecosystem engineers affect the (trophic) structure and dynamics of intertidal soft-bottom communities. Hence, this thesis provides a better understanding of the role of ecosystem engineers in assembling and structuring ecological interaction networks and their importance for effective conservation management of coastal ecosystems. In chapter 2 and 3, we demonstrate that ecosystem engineering effects of reefbuilding bivalves are spatially extended and act on multiple trophic levels. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, transects across three mussel reefs and three nearby sandy areas without reefs showed a peak in cockle densities at ~100 meters coastward from the mussel reef, while cockle abundances within the reefs and in the nearby sandy areas were very low. Additionally, transplantation of tagged cockles showed higher survival of cockles and higher juvenile cockle densities in the area close to the mussel reef compared to areas without mussels, whereas cockle growth was lower close to the reef. This spatial pattern was caused by scale-dependent effects of mussel reefs: in the mussel-reef, cockle survival was reduced by deteriorated sediment conditions through biodeposition and by algal depletion, while further away from the mussel reefs, cockle survival was facilitated due to the reduction of water flow velocity. Next, we demonstrate with a field survey that a comparable spatial pattern is visible in other benthic species and that these effects on their spatial distribution cascade through multiple trophic levels. Distance from the reef,  sediment properties and benthic food abundance simultaneously explained significant parts of the distribution of Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus), Eurasian Curlews (Numenius arquata) and Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica), with higher densities of these shorebirds in the surrounding area of the reef compared to sandy un-engineered tidal flats. Results from these two chapters were then used to develop an experiment to investigate the interactive role of ecosystem engineering, predation and competition in structuring an intertidal bivalve population in the Wadden Sea (chapter 4). In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m-2) and shorebird predation at a site engineered by a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at a sandy control site. We conclude that cockles are caught in the middle. Ecosystem engineering by mussel beds can enhance cockle densities by reducing hydrodynamic stress and predation across different life stages, but can reduce cockle growth by reducing seawater flow and by affecting inter-specific competition for food. This study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem engineers in structuring intertidal communities and the necessity to integrate multiple interaction types into a single framework. In chapter 5, we empirically tested the hypothesis that recovery of aboveground structure and stable sediments provided by ecosystem engineers facilitates the intertidal benthic community by influencing species composition and trophic structure. In a large-scale experiment at two different sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea (West vs. East), we applied anti-erosion mats and added adult mussels to test for the effects of sediment stabilization and habitat modification, respectively. The antierosion mats mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the infaunal community, while the addition of mussels mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the epifaunal community, irrespective of location. In this chapter, we conclude that structure-providing and sediment-stabilizing species such as mussels play an important role in facilitating the benthic community throughout the Wadden Sea by influencing species composition and trophic structure. On top of this large-scale experiment, the interactive effects of ecosystem engineering and predation on bivalve recruitment were investigated (chapter 6). Results show that both adult mussels and the anti-erosion mat facilitated epibenthic mussel recruits, whereas three other endobenthic bivalve species were facilitated by the mat, but inhibited by mussels. However, these observed facilitation and inhibition effects, only emerged when predators were excluded, demonstrating strong interactive effects between ecosystem engineering and predation. Our findings suggest that loss of ecosystem engineers and disturbance of trophic interactions can strongly hinder bivalve recruitment in coastal ecosystems. Finally, the effects of ecosystem engineering by seagrass and burrowing crabs on food web assembly were studied (chapter 7). Using a unique combination of remote sensing, field surveys, and stable isotopes, we reveal that hierarchical habitat modification by seagrasses and burrowing crabs transform simple intertidal food webs into a complex mosaic of linked inter- and subtidal food webs over long timescales. We found that seagrass and burrowing crabs dramatically alter food web structure, composition and its temporal development by accumulating silt and creating large intertidal pools in the accumulated silt layer, respectively. Our empirical findings show that ecosystem engineering is strongly interwoven with trophic networks by changing food web composition over time. Concluding, results presented in this thesis demonstrate that ecosystem engineering can strongly affect the trophic structure and dynamics of intertidal communities and that ecosystem engineers have a much larger ecological impact on the intertidal community than their actual size and lifespan suggests. Ecosystem engineers in intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems are therefore appealing conservation targets because by managing a single species, entire communities can be positively affected. Nevertheless, findings in this thesis also illustrate that ecosystem engineering are often entangled in a network of multiple interaction types, illustrating that conservation and restoration efforts should focus on multiple species within an integrated network of interaction types. Additionally, due to long-term and large-scale dynamics characterizing ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’Arguin, it is expected that only long-term and large-scale management approaches, such as prolonged closure of large parts to industrial fisheries and mechanical dredging, will be successful in order to restore and protect the unique values of these important intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems.","van der Zee., E.M.",NULL,"van der Zee., Elsbeth Merith, E.M.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/11370/9c42ae3f-9175-45da-9f1f-4637ea9f850e,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

Mean&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;SD catch per unit effort of 33.6&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;10.9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1.9&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;3.1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83.7% of sharks caught (74.7% blue sharks; 93.3% mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods.","Doherty, P.D.; Alfaro-Shigueto, J.; Hodgson, D.J.; Mangel, J.C.; Witt, M.J.; Godley, B.J.",WOS:000337738800006,"Doherty, Philip, P.D.","Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Sch Biosci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.1104,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Peru,NULL,"Conservation, ""Sharks"", ""Sustainability""",NULL,CPUE; Small-scale fisheries,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (<em>Pseudotriakis microdon</em>) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.","Friedlander, A.M.; Caselle, J.E.; Ballesteros, E.; Brown, E.K.; Turchik, A.; Sala, E.",WOS:000338709500030,"Friedlander, Alan, A.M.","Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0100142,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Pitcairn I.,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The time series is analysed using Similarities Profiles (SIMPROF) tests and associated methods. Q-mode analysis using clustering with Type 1 SIMPROF addresses multivariate structure among samples, showing that there is clear structure associated with differences among years. Inverse (r-mode) analysis using Type 2 SIMPROF decisively rejects a hypothesis that species are not associated with each other. Clustering of the variables (species) with Type 3 SIMPROF identifies groups of species which covary coherently through the time-series. The time-series is characterised by a dramatic decline in abundances and diversity between the 1993 and 1996 surveys. By 1998 there had been a shift in community composition from the 1993 situation, with different species dominating. Communities had recovered in terms of abundance and species richness, but different species dominated the community. No single factor could be identified which unequivocally explained the dramatic changes observed in the SMNR. Possible causes were the effects of dispersed oil and dispersants from the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996 and the cessation of dredge-spoil disposal off St Annes Head in 1995, but the most likely cause was severe weather. With many species, and a demonstrable recovery from an impact, communities within the SMNR appear to be diverse and resilient. If attributable to natural storms, the changes observed here indicate that natural variability may be much more important than is generally taken into account in the design of monitoring programmes.","Somerfield, P.J.; Burton, M.; Sanderson, W.G.",WOS:000345723700007,"Somerfield, P.J.","Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2014.06.004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Ecosystem change;     Marine protected areas;     Nonparametric multivariate analysis;     Time-series;     Similarity profiles;     Marine monitoring,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11-year (2002–2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick rearing stage. A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flatfish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consumption between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer. Nutrient requirements of breeding adults peak during the chick rearing stage, making this a key period in terms of dependence of the breeding parents on discarded fish as food source.","Sotillo, A.; Depestele, J.; Courtens, W.; Vincx, M.; Stienen, E.W.M.",WOS:000346536800009,"Sotillo, Alejandro, A.",Marine Biology Section – Ghent University,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5253/arde.v102i2.a9,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",North Sea,"Larus argentatus Pontoppidan, 1763, ""Larus fuscus Linnaeus, 1758""",Fisheries,NULL,Discards; Scavenging gulls; Flock composition,Journal article,NULL,NULL

U.S.A. 111(51)</i>: 18150-18155","Increasing global temperature and sea-level rise have led to concern about expansions in the distribution and prevalence of complex-lifecycle parasites (CLPs). Indeed, numerous environmental variables can influence the infectivity and reproductive output of many pathogens. Digenean trematodes are CLPs with intermediate invertebrate and definitive vertebrate hosts. Global warming and sea level rise may affect these hosts to varying degrees, and the effect of increasing temperature on parasite prevalence has proven to be nonlinear and difficult to predict. Projecting the response of parasites to anthropogenic climate change is vital for human health, and a longer term perspective (10<sup>4</sup> y) offered by the subfossil record is necessary to complement the experimental and historical approaches of shorter temporal duration (10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> y). We demonstrate, using a high-resolution 9,600-y record of trematode parasite traces in bivalve hosts from the Holocene Pearl River Delta, that prevalence was significantly higher during the earliest stages of sea level rise, significantly lower during the maximum transgression, and statistically indistinguishable in the other stages of sea-level rise and delta progradation. This stratigraphic paleobiological pattern represents the only long-term high-resolution record of pathogen response to global change, is consistent with fossil and recent data from other marine basins, and is instructive regarding the future of disease. We predict an increase in trematode prevalence concurrent with anthropogenic warming and marine transgression, with negative implications for estuarine macrobenthos, marine fisheries, and human health.","Huntley, J.W.; Fürsich, F.T.; Alberti, M.; Hethke, M.; Liu, C.",WOS:000346767200033,"Fürsich, Franz T., F.T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.1416747111,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Mollusca,NULL,NULL,parasites     disease     global warming     paleoecology     mollusks,Journal article,NULL,NULL

These are crucial in environmental and agricultural challenges, e.g., they are a basic element in the generation of species distribution models. Unfortunately, their exploitation is still difficult and time consuming for many scientists. No database currently exists that can claim to host, and make available in a seamless way, all the species occurrence data needed by the ecology scientific community. Occurrence data are scattered among several databases and information systems. It is not easy to retrieve records from them, because of differences in the adopted protocols, formats and granularity. Once collected, datasets have to be selected, homogenised and pre-processed before being ready-to-use in scientific analysis and modelling. This paper introduces a set of facilities offered by the D4Science Data Infrastructure to support these phases of the scientific process. It also exemplifies how they contribute to reduce the time spent in data quality assessment and curation thus improving the overall performance of the scientific investigation.","Candela, L.; Castelli, D.; Coro, G.; Lelil, L.; Mangiacrapa, F.; Marioli, V.; Pagano, P.",WOS:000353744600006,"Marioli, Valentina, V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.07.006,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,"Data integration, ""Data processing""",NULL,Data sharing; Species occurrence data,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The last comprehensive review of this topic was over 25 years ago and much work has been published since. These recent studies expand the field reports of species living in hyposaline environments and detail experimental research on the responses, physiological range, and limits of echinoderms to salinity challenges. I provide a brief review of the historical concepts and measures of salinity and relate this overview to the physiological and ecological studies on echinoderms. Many marine biologists are not aware that chemical oceanographers advocate abandoning today’s commonly used measure of salinity, ‘PSU’, in favour of absolute salinity (S<sub>A</sub>)—a return to the ppt (‰) metric. The literature survey reveals only one euryhaline-tolerant species in the Southern Hemisphere (there are 42 in the North) and more euryhaline species in the geologically older, brackish seas. The green sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</i>, is one of the most tolerant echinoids to hyposalinity. Different source populations have varying levels of acclimation and tolerance to hyposalinity. Experiments show that green urchins previously unexposed to hyposalinity experience a clear decrease in growth rates; however, this adverse effect is short lived. Green urchins already acclimated to hyposalinity can endure intense and repeated bouts and grow at the same rate of urchins not exposed. Promising future work on the physiological and cellular mechanisms of hyposalinity acclimation includes comparative studies of the role of heat shock proteins in the response to changing salinities.","Russell, M.P.",WOS:000332424000003,"Russell, Michael, M.P.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-408096-6.00003-1,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Echinodermata, ""Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O.F.

This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of nonnative fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or VIS. From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the INBO IPT as two datasets: ‘VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium’ and ‘VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgium’. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 44,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt (“Zeeschelde”), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 69 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species.

This has partly been due to a limited knowledge of taxonomy, the rarity of some taxa as well as extreme temporal and spatial variation in abundance of medusae. The latter may reflect the small spatial scales of many populations. Although cubozoan medusae vary greatly in size, they are all excellent swimmers and have strong orientation behaviour. This, combined with resting on the bottom for extended periods of the day in some taxa (e.g. <i>Copula sivickisi</i>), suggests that dispersal may be limited. Despite this, some taxa, such as <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i>, have broad pantropical distributions suggesting a successful phenotype and a long geologic history. Statoliths allow medusae to be aged and provide unique opportunities to obtain accurate estimates of growth and to test ecological hypotheses. The life histories of few taxa have been studied, and until recently only the life cycle of <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i> had been fully described. The ability to rear species is critical for experimentation. Further, knowledge of the ecology of cubozoans is important for understanding population dynamics and predicting risk to swimmers and prey. With the exception of worldwide occurrences, population units have not been determined using well-known tools such as comparative morphology, genetics and elemental chemistry, and this is overdue. New technology is offering exciting ways to study these elusive creatures. This, combined with experimentation, will provide a better understanding of the physical and biological factors influencing the distribution and abundance of cubozoans within and among populations, both now and under climate change.

Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records—passing a specific combination of these QC steps—is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves.

Although several engineering species have declined dramatically in the past centuries, the consequences of their loss for the trophic structure of intertidal benthic communities remain largely unclear. In this study, we experimentally test the hypothesis that above- and belowground habitat modifications by ecosystem engineers, facilitate distinctly different, but trophically more diverse benthic communities, using intertidal mussel and tube worm beds as model systems. We constructed a large-scale experiment at two intertidal mudflats in the Dutch Wadden Sea, with distinctly different environmental conditions. At both sites, we applied anti-erosion mats to simulate belowground structure and sediment stabilization by commonly found tube worm beds and crossed this with the addition of adult mussels to investigate effects of aboveground structure. The anti-erosion mats mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity (i.e., feeding guild richness and diversity) of the infaunal community, while the addition of mussels primarily enhanced species and trophic diversity of the epifaunal community, irrespective of location. The effect size of mussel addition was larger at the exposed site in the western Wadden Sea compared to the more sheltered eastern site, probably due to relatively stronger abiotic stress alleviation. We conclude that structure-providing and sediment-stabilizing species such as reef-building bivalves and tube worms, form the foundation for trophically diverse benthic communities. In intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems like the Wadden Sea, their conservation and restoration are therefore critical for overall ecosystem functioning.","van der Zee, E.M.; Tielens, E.; Holthuijsen, S.; Donadi, S.; Eriksson, B.K.; van der Veer, H.W.; Piersma, T.; Olff, H.; van der Heide, T.",WOS:000351250600005,"Olff, Han, H.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.01.001,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Mytilus edulis,NULL,NULL,iotic structure; Ecosystem engineers; Mytilus edulis; Sediment stability; Trophic diversity; Wadden Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, gelatinous zooplankton has been largely understudied and the absence of quantitative long-term data for the studied area impedes drawing conclusions on potential increasing densities. This study gives a comprehensive overview of the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of gelatinous zooplankton in terms of diversity and density in the Belgian part of the North Sea and the adjacent Schelde estuary, based on monthly and seasonal samples between March 2011 and February 2012. Three Scyphozoa, three Ctenophora and 27 Hydrozoa taxa were identified, including three non-indigenous species: <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>, <i>Nemopsis bachei</i> and <i>Lovenella assimilis</i>. In general, one gelatinous zooplankton assemblage was found across locations and seasons. Average gelatinous zooplankton densities reached up to 18 ind•m<sup>-3</sup> near the coast, gradually declining towards the open sea. In the brackish Schelde estuary, average densities remained below 3 ind•m<sup>-3</sup>. Highest gelatinous zooplankton densities were recorded in summer and autumn. Overall, hydromedusae were the most important group both in terms of diversity and density. The ctenophore <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> and the hydromedusa <i>Clytia</i> sp. were present in every season and at every location. Gelatinous zooplankton densities never outnumbered the non-gelatinous zooplankton densities recorded from the WP3 samples. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns seemed to be mainly driven by temperature (season) and salinity (location). Other environmental parameters including (larger) non-gelatinous zooplankton densities (as an important food source) were not retained in the most parsimonious DistLM model.In terms of population dynamics, <i>Beroe</i> sp. seemed to follow the three reproductive cycles of its prey <i>P. pileus</i> and the presence of <i>M. leidyi</i>, which were abundant in a broad size spectrum in summer and autumn. In general, gelatinous zooplankton diversity was higher, but densities were in the same order of magnitude compared to adjacent areas in the North Sea. This study provides a baseline against which a potential increase in gelatinous zooplankton in the Belgian part of the North Sea and the Schelde estuary can be measured.","Vansteenbrugge, L.; Van Regenmortel, T.; De Troch, M.; Vincx, M.; Hostens, K.",WOS:000350084100005,"Vansteenbrugge, Lies, L.","Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO), Animal Science Unit, Aquatic Environment and Quality, Bio-environmental Research Group",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2014.12.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Beroe, ""Clytia"", ""Ctenophora"", ""Hydrozoa"", ""Lovenella assimilis"", ""Mnemiopsis leidyi"", ""Nemopsis bachei"", ""Scyphozoa""",NULL,NULL,    Jellyfish;     Scyphozoa;     Hydrozoa;     Ctenophora;     Seasonality;     Southern North Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Closing the former to fishing has recently been proposed in the literature and is currently an issue of debate in various international fora. We determine the degree of overlap between fish caught in these two areas of the ocean, examine how global catch might change if catches of straddling species or taxon groups increase within EEZs as a result of protection of adjacent high seas; and identify countries that are likely to gain or lose in total catch quantity and value following high-seas closure. We find that <0.01% of the quantity and value of commercial fish taxa are obtained from catch taken exclusively in the high seas, and if the catch of straddling taxa increases by 18% on average following closure because of spillover, there would be no loss in global catch. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, would decrease from 0.66 to 0.33. Thus, closing the high seas could be catch-neutral while inequality in the distribution of fisheries benefits among the world's maritime countries could be reduced by 50%.","Sumaila, U.R.; Lam, V.W.Y.; Miller, D.D.; Teh, L.; Watson, R.A.; Zeller, D.; Cheung, W.W.L.; Côté, I.M.; Rogers, A.D.; Roberts, C.; Sala, E.; Pauly, D.",WOS:000209875800001,"Miller, Dana, D.D.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep08481,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here, we forecast the potential northward progression of 515 fish species following climate change, and report the rate of potential species interchange between the Atlantic and the Pacific via the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage. For this, we projected niche-based models under climate change scenarios and simulated the spread of species through the passages when climatic conditions became suitable. Results reveal a complex range of responses during this century, and accelerated interchange after 2050. By 2100 up to 41 species could enter the Pacific and 44 species could enter the Atlantic, via one or both passages.

An important emerging regulatory framework on environmental sustainability for business operations is the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 (IFC PS6). Within PS6, identification of biodiversity significance is articulated through the concept of “Critical Habitat”, a definition developed by the IFC and detailed through criteria aligned with those that support internationally accepted biodiversity designations. No publicly available tools have been developed in either the marine or terrestrial realm to assess the likelihood of sites or operations being located within PS6-defined Critical Habitat. This paper presents a starting point towards filling this gap in the form of a preliminary global map that classifies more than 13 million km<sup>2</sup> of marine and coastal areas of importance for biodiversity (protected areas, Key Biodiversity Areas [KBA], sea turtle nesting sites, cold- and warm-water corals, seamounts, seagrass beds, mangroves, saltmarshes, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps) based on their overlap with Critical Habitat criteria, as defined by IFC. In total, 5798×10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (1.6%) of the analysis area (global ocean plus coastal land strip) were classed as Likely Critical Habitat, and 7526×103 km2 (2.1%) as Potential Critical Habitat; the remainder (96.3%) were Unclassified. The latter was primarily due to the paucity of biodiversity data in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction and/or in deep waters, and the comparatively fewer protected areas and KBAs in these regions. Globally, protected areas constituted 65.9% of the combined Likely and Potential Critical Habitat extent, and KBAs 29.3%, not accounting for the overlap between these two features. Relative Critical Habitat extent in Exclusive Economic Zones varied dramatically between countries. This work is likely to be of particular use for industries operating in the marine and coastal realms as an early screening aid prior to in situ Critical Habitat assessment; to financial institutions making investment decisions; and to those wishing to implement good practice policies relevant to biodiversity management.

Our data show that Amsterdam albatrosses exhibit a wide and variable foraging radius (from 326 ± 193 km during brooding to 5519 ± 766 km for immatures) and at-sea distribution across stages, putting them beyond the French EEZ of Amsterdam Island for all or part of the trips surveyed in each stage, and even outside the Indian Ocean when breeding. In all, the breeding versus non-breeding albatrosses visited the EEZs of 1 to 3 versus 3 to 4 countries, respectively. Only breeders visited the&nbsp; EEZs of Madagascar and Mauritius, while only non-breeders visited the EEZs of Australia, South Africa and Namibia. This study stresses the relevance to conservation of obtaining synoptic information on the distribution of threatened species, especially regarding the breeding versus non-breeding categories of populations.","Thiebot, J.-B.; Delord, K.; Marteau, C.; Weimerskirch, H.",WOS:000334049000007,"Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste, J.-B.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/esr00564,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,Aves,"Fisheries, ""Global Positioning System"", ""Juveniles"", ""Marine birds"", ""Tracking""",NULL,Seabird; Global Location Sensing-GLS; Global Positioning System -GPS ; Platform terminal transmitter -PTT; Non-breeding  ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here, we synthesize recent, empirical within-system spatio-temporal analyses of some temperate and subarctic large marine ecosystems  in which regime shifts have (and have not) occurred.

Although the EU repeatedly stated that the €70 million/yr paid under the protocol provided good value for money, this assertion was hard to maintain considering the limited utilisation of the agreement. The paper analyses why the EU concluded an agreement with Mauritania that was not wanted by their industry and that was therefore only partially used in the end. It describes the decision making process inside the EU; the different parties involved and their different objectives. It is concluded that the EU decision making process suffers from a lack of transparency and that the combination of a business agreement with development aid resulted in an agreement which did not attain either of the stated objectives.

Mapping and estimating national green GDPs is a challenging task. In this study, we estimated the global market and non-market monetary values using two images, GlobCover 2009 and nighttime satellite imagery, as well as a comprehensive dataset. We also developed an integrated method supported by geographic information system (GIS) techniques, focused on spatial heterogeneity and real value, to create synthetic green GDP maps at global and national scales. Our results show that in 2009, for the entire biosphere, the ecosystem services value (ESV) could be estimated at US$ 149.61 trillion. Approximately 75.15% of the ESV is contributed by marine systems. The world GDP in 2009 was about US$ 71.75 trillion (for 225 countries or regions), resulting in a ratio of total ESV to GDP of approximately 2.09–1. Nighttime satellite imagery represents a more spatially explicit indicator of market value than does GDP. We also found that the distribution of the synthetic national green GDPs follows Zipf's Law, which holds that internal coherence exists among countries. A crude but simple indicator of the %ESV indicates that the relationship between the GDP and ESV is not always in a fixed pattern. The reliability of this result was demonstrated by comparing it with previous research and other relevant indices. We found a very high degree of confidence associated with this product. The method presented here is generally applicable at the global and continental scales and is applicable at the national scale for mapping the ESV and GDP. We hope that the results of this study will inform both policy-makers and the public about national green GDPs and encourage them to incorporate these values into policy decisions.","Li, G.; Fang, C.",WOS:000342656100032,"Li, Guangdong, G.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.05.020,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,Geographic information systems,NULL,Ecosystem services values; Ecosystem services mapping;   Green GDP accounting; Value transfer; DMSP/OLS nighttime light ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We tested the approach for South Africa, at a national level for various taxa and at a provincial level for plants.

When alien species in South Africa were evaluated there were many false-negatives (sensitivity of 32% for terrestrial and 40% for marine species), because the GISD is not comprehensive, but few false positives (specificity of 91% for terrestrial and 89% for marine species). The methodology was easy to apply at different political levels, but we found substantial overlaps between the national and provincial watch lists of plants. This simple technique is rapid, easily repeatable, flexible, transparent, works across taxa, and does not require substantial financial or scientific input.

A coding mechanism has been developed based on available mathematical formulas, which enables the rapid computation of similar codes based on any high-quality geometric data. An application of the system is demonstrated in order to assess how grouping and ordering data along a coastline may be explored.

The Gulf of Mexico was divided into four geographic regions and six depth classes; ß-diversity between the 24 polygons was calculated with the Sørensen similarity index and analyzed using a cluster analysis and an ordination based on non-metric multidimensional scaling. Both analyses revealed a strong influence of depth on the polychaete assemblages. The polychaete fauna in the southeastern sector was the most distinctive among the four sectors. Each of the 835 polychaete species and subspecies was assigned to a class in the categories “mobility,” “feeding strategy,” and “feeding appendage” and the compositions of the categories throughout different depths were examined. The categories introduced by Fauchald and Jumars (Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev 17:193–284, 1979) were amended and the suggested changes discussed. Each species was assigned to a biogeographical class based on their worldwide distributions. Ten percent of the polychaete species were endemic to the Gulf of Mexico. More than 40 % of the species were exclusively found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, about one-third of the polychaetes had a wide distribution, and 15 % of all species were restricted to both coasts of the American continent.

Universiteit Gent: Gent. 62, vi-xvi pp.","This work assessed the state of our knowledge on marine biodiversity globally based on the world's largest biogeographic database, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). OBIS contains 112,514 distinct marine species mainly originating from three major taxonomic groups: Crustacea, Mollusca, and Pisces. These three groups represent more than half of all data in OBIS, resulting in a high incompleteness of other taxonomic groups. Different oceanic regions show the same pattern: the same three groups were highly represented. Taxonomic gaps remain for other groups. Also in terms of depth, and geographical coverage gaps were found. Large parts of the open ocean are under sampled and do not represent a similar apparent species richness as other open ocean regions with higher sampling effort and completeness. The Chao2 species richness allowed the assessment of the completeness of OBIS data. Coastal areas mostly deliver reliable estimators, but the completeness stays low. These results can provide baselines for future assessments such as the World Ocean Assessment of the United Nations and can guide policy makers in setting priorities towards enhancing our knowledgebase by targeting gaps in taxonomy, ocean depth, and geographical coverage.The OBIS database also provided insights in species distribution changes. A poleward shift was detected with a narrowing range for tropical and temperate species. However, first results showed that polar shifted on average a movement towards the equator and an expanding range. Still, only the range for tropical species differed greatly, where a clear shift away from the equator was seen.","Dujardin, F.",NULL,"Dujardin, Frédéric, F.","Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology",NULL,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

The Stygiomysida (2 families, 2 genera, 16 species), however, are found primarily in subterranean waters, but always in waters with a marine influence. The Mysida and Stygiomysida body is divided into three main regions: cephalon, thorax, and abdomen. They are shrimp-like in appearance, containing morphological features earlier referred to as defining a ""caridoid facies"". The shrimp-like morphology was to some extent diagnostic for the historic Decapod taxon Schizopoda, containing the Nebalia, Mysida, Lophogastrida, and Euphausiacea. In 1904 the concept of Schizopoda was abandoned, and the Mysidacea (Mysida and Lophogastrida) along with Cumacea, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Tanaidacea were placed in a new taxon, the Peracarida. Later discoveries of groundwater mysids led to the establishment of Stygiomysida, but placement to either Lophogastrida or Mysida remained unclear. The presence of oostegites and absence of podobranchiae, coupled with non-statocyst bearing uropods have been used to classify the Stygiomysida as a primitive Mysida family, comparable to Petalophthalmidae. On the other hand, equally suggestive characters, but for a Lophogastrida affiliation, was suggested for the archaic foregut characters and again, non-statocyst bearing uropods. With the inclusion of DNA sequence data of ribosomal genes, sister group relationships between Stygiomysida, Lophogastrida, and Mictacea within the Peracarida are observed, which supports a classification of the Stygiomysida as a separate order removed from the Mysida.","Meland, K.; Mees, J.; Porter, M.; Wittmann, K.J.",WOS:000353713100042,"Mees, Jan, J.",Ghent University,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0124656,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Mysida, ""Stygiomysida""","Reviews, ""Taxonomy""",NULL,SARS    Phylogenetics    Somites    Abdomen    Habitats    Thorax    Fossil record    Fossils  Stygiomysida,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The family Holothuriidae has been increasingly studied in search for these compounds. With many species awaiting recognition and formal description this family currently consists of five genera and the systematics at the species-level taxonomy is, however, not yet fully understood. We provide a bibliographic review of the triterpene glycosides that has been reported within the Holothuriidae and analyzed the relationship of certain compounds with the presence of Cuvierian tubules. We found 40 species belonging to four genera and 121 compounds. Holothurin A and B are the most common saponins for <i>Actinopyga</i>, <i>Holothuria</i>, and <i>Pearsonothuria</i>. The genus <i>Bohadschia</i> presents mainly bivittoside C and D. <i>Actinopyga</i> has only sulfated saponins mainly oxidized, <i>Bohadschia</i> non-sulfated ones mainly non-oxidized, <i>Holothuria</i> and <i>Pearsonothuria</i> contain both types of compounds, mainly oxidized. Within the genus <i>Holothuria</i>, the subgenus <i>Panningothuria</i> only has non-sulfated saponins. The presence of sulfated and non-sulfated compounds seemingly relates to the expellability or the absence of Cuvierian tubules and the temporal or permanent concealing habits of the species. Our study concludes that better insights into the systematic distribution of saponins in Holothuriidae will only be possible if the identifications of the investigated species are confirmed by a taxonomist, especially in this group wherein cryptic species and variation between life-history stages are common and yet poorly understood. Understanding of saponin distribution within the Holothuriidae would also benefit from a stabilization of triterpene glycoside nomenclature.","Honey-Escandon, M; Arreguin-Espinosa, R; Solis-Marin, A; Samyn, Y.",WOS:000348089300003,"Honey-Escandon, M","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Biomacromol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.09.007,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Actinopyga, ""Bohadschia"", ""Holothuria"", ""Holothuriidae"", ""Panningothuria"", ""Pearsonothuria""",NULL,NULL,Cuvierian tubules; Saponins; Taxonomy; family Holothuriidae,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Ecosystem management needs to ensure a sustainable exploitation of marine resources as well as the protection of sensitive habitats, taking account of potential multiple-use conflicts and impacts over large spatial scales. The urgent need for large-scale spatial data on benthic species and communities resulted in an increasing application of distribution modelling (DM). The use of DM techniques enables to employ full spatial coverage data of environmental variables to predict benthic spatial distribution patterns. Especially, statistical DMs have opened new possibilities for ecosystem management applications, since they are straightforward and the outputs are easy to interpret and communicate. Mechanistic modelling techniques, targeting the fundamental niche of species, and Bayesian belief networks are the most promising to further improve DM performance in the marine realm. There are many actual and potential management applications of DMs in the marine benthic environment, these are (i) early warning systems for species invasion and pest control, (ii) to assess distribution probabilities of species to be protected, (iii) uses in monitoring design and spatial management frameworks (e.g. MPA designations), and (iv) establishing long-term ecosystem management measures (accounting for future climate-driven changes in the ecosystem). It is important to acknowledge also the limitations associated with DM applications in a marine management context as well as considering new areas for future DM developments. The knowledge of explanatory variables, for example, setting the basis for DM, will continue to be further developed: this includes both the abiotic (natural and anthropogenic) and the more pressing biotic (e.g. species interactions) aspects of the ecosystem. While the response variables on the other hand are often focused on species presence and some work undertaken on species abundances, it is equally important to consider, e.g. biological traits or benthic ecosystem functions in DM applications. Tools such as DMs are suitable to forecast the possible effects of climate change on benthic species distribution patterns and hence could help to steer present-day ecosystem management.","Reiss, H; Birchenough, S; Borja, A; Buhl-Mortensen, L; Craeymeersch, J; Dannheim, J; Darr, A; Galparsoro, I; Gogina, M; Neumann, H; Populus, J; Rengstorf, M; Valle, M; van Hoey, G.; Zettler, L; Degraer, S.",WOS:000350154300002,"Reiss, H","Univ Nordland, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, N-8049 Bodo, Norway.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsu107,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,ecosystem approach; environmental monitoring; habitat suitabilitymodelling; macrofauna; mapping; marine spatial planning (MSP);predictive modelling; species distribution modelling,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Acoustic propagation measurements have been used to monitor primary production over broad spatial scales (10<sup>1</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> m) in seagrass meadows, and work is in development to assess the application of acoustics for measuring aggregate production in kelp beds and forests. In addition, scientific echosounders have been used routinely for mapping these benthic habitats and, in some cases, identify dominant species. Further advances in these areas require the development of species-specific acoustic models. However there is little knowledge of the acoustic properties of macroalgae, in part because measuring sound speed in large macroalgae is challenging due to their complex morphology. In this study four different methods are developed and trialled to determine the intrinsic sound speed of <i>Ecklonia radiata</i> tissue based on measurement of the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse, while compressibility is calculated from density measurements. Direct methods involved lengths of stipe and tightly packed stacks of macroalgae blade tissue. Indirect methods focused on an entire intact macroalga submerged in seawater, and a homogenate solution containing seawater and blended blade tissue. Blade tissue showed a density contrast (relative to seawater) of 1.23 and a sound speed contrast of 1.0374 for the stacks. The homogenate solution gave a sound speed contrast of 1.0424. Stipe tissue density and sound speed were lower. Density contrast was 1.04 and sound speed contrasts were 1.0179 (SD = 0.0025) and 1.0064 (SD = 0.0032) depending on the sample. Whole macroalgae had age- and size-dependent densities with an average density contrast of 1.11 (SD = 0.09) and showed an average sound speed of 1572.8 m/s (17.8 °C) and contrast of 1.0404 (SD = 0.0139). Compressibility was higher in stipe than blade tissue, with 3.924e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> and 3.982e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> for stipes and 3.209e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> and 3.180e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> for blade in stacks and homogenate respectively. The results show that <i>E. radiata</i> sound speed and density are higher, and compressibility lower, than that of seawater. This is likely related to high concentrations of alginate, and other structural and storage carbohydrates in the macroalgae, and thus may vary seasonally. The differences between tissue types found for all properties reflect the morphology and anatomy of this macroalga, with tightly condensed chloroplast cells in blade tissue and loosely packed structural cells in the stipe. This research provides essential input parameters to numerical models that will enhance acoustic habitat mapping and allow the development of acoustic inverse methods. This may enable the estimation of aggregate primary production over large spatial scales in temperate kelp habitats, thus informing their future management.","Randall, J.; Hermand, J.-P.; Ernould, M.-E.; Ross, J; Johnson, C",WOS:000346894900052,"Randall, Jo, J.","Environmental Hydroacoustics Laboratory, Université libre de Bruxelles",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.09.013,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,Ecklonia radiata,NULL,NULL,Compressibility; Density; Ecklonia radiata; Seaweed; Sound speed;Ultrasound,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Such movements are also associated with the introduction of non-native species via hitchhiking individual organisms. The oyster industry, one of the most important forms of marine aquaculture, embodies these issues. In Europe disease outbreaks affecting cultivated populations of the naturalized oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> caused a major disruption of production in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mitigation procedures involved massive imports of stock from the species’ native range in the northwestern Pacific from 1971 to 1977. We assessed the role stock imports played in the introduction of non-native marine species (including pathogens) from the northwestern Pacific to Europe through a methodological and critical appraisal of record data. The discovery rate of non-native species (a proxy for the introduction rate) from 1966 to 2012 suggests a continuous vector activity over the entire period. Disease outbreaks that have been affecting oyster production since 2008 may be a result of imports from the northwestern Pacific, and such imports are again being considered as an answer to the crisis. Although successful as a remedy in the short and medium terms, such translocations may bring new diseases that may trigger yet more imports (self-reinforcing or positive feedback loop) and lead to the introduction of more hitchhikers. Although there is a legal framework to prevent or reduce these introductions, existing procedures should be improved.","Mineur, F.; Le Roux, A; Maggs, A; Verlaque, M",WOS:000344794200024,"Mineur, Frédéric, F.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Global Food Secur, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12363,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Crassostrea gigas,NULL,NULL,biological invasions; hitchhikers; mollusc diseases; non-indigenousspecies; OsHV-1; oyster farming; pathways; vectors; cultivo de ostras;enfermedades de moluscos; especies no-nativas; invasiones biologicas;OsHV-1; pasajeros; senderos; vectores,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Desmodoridae was a monophyletic group, but the relationships within the family could not be recovered; the subfamilies Desmodorinae and Spiriniinae were not monophyletic meanwhile the monophyly of Stilbonematinae was not fully supported due to a few specimens of questionable identity. COI performed better than SSU rDNA to disentangle relationships among closely related species and suggested the presence of cryptic diversity within Desmodoridae. COI is effective to explore cryptic diversity and barcode species within Nematoda, with a possible threshold of genetic distance of 5% between conspecific and interspecific sequences, but DNA barcoding is limited by the poor knowledge of the diversity and taxonomy of the group and the lack of a good reference database of vouchered COI sequences.","Armenteros, M; Rojas-Corzo, A; Ruiz-Abierno, A; Derycke, S.; Backeljau, T.; Decraemer, W.",WOS:000343077100010,"Decraemer, Wilfrida, W.",Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences,https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-00002824,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Chromadorea, ""Comesomatidae"", ""Desmodoridae Filipjev, 1922"", ""Enoplea"", ""Monhysterida"", ""Nematoda"", ""Spiriniinae"", ""Stilbonematinae"", ""Xyalidae""",NULL,NULL,18S rDNA; Chromadorea; Enoplea; molecular; phylogeny; taxonomy,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Molecular phylogenetics recently revealed that they are not members of the externally similar yet phylogenetically derived Pyramidellidae, but instead potentially one of the oldest clades among the heterobranch Gastropoda. Furthermore, current data surprisingly indicate a sister-group relationship with Rhodopemorpha, highly aberrant marine slugs with previously unclear affinities. Murchisonellidae are characterized by a specialized pincer-like radula, but very little further data exist on soft-body anatomy for most species, and there are only a few observations of living animals. Investigation of the anatomy of Murchisonellidae may thus yield new data providing insights into early heterobranch evolution and that of enigmatic Rhodopemorpha. We collected live specimens of the murchisonellid Koloonella cf. minutissima ( Laseron, 1951), a member of a genus known mainly from eastern Australia. We provide detailed live photographs and interactive 3D data on all major organ systems, based on serial histological sections. The mantle cavity is shown to contain several distinct glands, a pair of which is conspicuously similar to glands found in Rhodopemorpha. The anterior digestive system contains a unique four-toothed radula, a feeble pharynx and a special, vacuolated oesophageal bulb. The reproductive system is complex and diaulic, and contains unusual structures. These results highlight structural diversity among minute lower Heterobranchia. Soft-body characters do not contradict, and may even support, the counterintuitive sister-group relationship with shell-less, wormshaped Rhodopemorpha. The classification of Murchisonellidae is discussed and a revised scheme is proposed.

Members of the suborder Euthecosomata are either torted snails with a coiled, sinistral shell (Limacinidae) or are straight-shelled with a symmetrical body and an unusual ventral mantle cavity (Orthoconcha). The classification and taxonomy of euthecosomes still depends on shells, but is being challenged by initial molecular data. There is a large body of morphoanatomical information dating from the beginning of the last century, and only biological (rather than soft-part anatomical) detail has been added since. For our initial study on pteropod morphoanatomy we have selected the potentially basal orthoconch genus Creseis Rang, 1828. Supplementing Meisenheimer's (1905) monographic work, we redescribe the microanatomy of the Mediterranean C. clava (Rang, 1828) from serial semithin sections and present 3D-models of all major organ systems. In the absence of histological differences we interpret the head to be fused with the foot, forming the wings with reduced labial tentacles and rhinophores. The postpharyngeal nerve ring is strongly condensed, showing fused buccal ganglia and a short visceral loop with two discernable ganglia. The genital system is monaulic and hermaphroditic, with female glands and a potential allosperm receptacle of unclear homology. An open seminal groove connects with the frontal copulatory organ, which shows complex penial infoldings. We confirm the 180° longitudinal rotation of the visceral organs relative to the condition in limacinids. As an alternative to ontogenetic detorsion, progenesis may have skipped torsion. Other obvious paedomorphoses such as single, basally forked tentacular nerves, suggest that heterochrony has been a driving force in thecosome evolution. Retaining the mantle cavity in a ventral position, Creseis has its large mantle gland—necessary for creating a mucus web for feeding—close to the mouth. Further comparative microanatomical data on orthoconchs and limacinids are needed to corroborate our assumptions of homology, and for reconstructing pteropod evolution once reliable molecular phylogenetic hypotheses are available.

Efficiency and feasibility of airlift suction sampling of hard substrata macro fauna at the Bay of Calvi (Corsica). MSc Thesis. Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM): Brussels.  15, 33 pp.","Many studies have proved the importance of hard substrata in marine ecosystems as numerous organisms depend on hard substrata because of its structural and functional heterogeneity. With the increase of artificial hard substrata, it is essential to understand understanding the community composition of these ecosystems. For example, with the increase of wind farms in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) accurate sampling of hard substrata fouling communities including rare and non-indigenous species is important. This study focuses on the qualification and quantification of the efficiency and accuracy of hard substrate sampling methods. From previous studies, the airlift suction sampler was found to be the most efficient method to sample hard substrata epifauna as the quadrat techniques underestimate the species density (loss of individuals during sampling). For this study, the efficiency and feasibility of three airlift devices with different tube diameter – 5,80 cm; 4,46 cm and 2,81 cm- was tested at three levels: (1) species and taxon density, (2) diversity, and (3) community structure. Samples were collected from concrete blocks outside the Revellata bay located on the western coast of Corsica. Randomly, five replicates were collected from the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the concrete blocks using different airlift diameters. A total of 2903 ind. m-2 spread over 147 species was identified. Only hard substratum related species were collected with the airlift devices. No matter which airlift device, the mean surface density are considerably higher in samples collected from the horizontal surface (4003 ind. m-2) than the samples collected from the vertical surface (2489 ind. m-2). The latter difference might be related to loss of sampling material on the vertical surface and less on the difference in community structure between both surfaces as no significant difference in algae cover was observed. The impact of the three different airlift diameter devices showed no statistically significant difference in density, diversity and community structure. No significant difference does not necessarily means no difference as significance is also depending on the intrinsic variability and hence degree of replication. This study showed that all three airlift diameters were accurate in sampling hard substrata. From a practical point of view, the medium-sized airlift device is more easily to operate at certain depth as the small-sized airlift device has the risk of clogging depending on the hard substrata coverage while the large-sized airlift device is more difficult to operate.

Meiofauna associated with seagrasses at natural CO<sub>2</sub> seeps in the Mediterranean Sea. MSc Thesis. Universiteit Antwerpen/Universiteit Gent/VUB: Antwerpen, Gent, Brussel. 16, 52 pp.","Due to the elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) level in the atmosphere, safe and effective carbon capture and storage methods are gaining more interest. The risks associated with storage and potential leakages for the marine environment are, however, largely unknown. CO2 release from sub-seabed reservoirs will have the greatest impact on the marine organisms living in or near the sea bottom. Areas where CO2 of volcanic origin is leaking from the seabed since centuries provide natural laboratories to study the long-term effects of high CO2 concentrations and subsequent seawater acidification. This study focused on the effects these environmental conditions have on meiofauna, and more particular on the community composition and diversity of the most two abundant taxa, i.e. nematodes and copepods. Samples were collected at natural CO2 seeps in Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows near Panarea Island. In conjunction, a colonisation experiment with seagrass mimics was also carried out to look into the short-term effects of CO2 leakage. Our observations indicated no significant differences in meiofauna densities between CO2 impacted and non-impacted sites either on natural seagrass leaves, shoots or seagrass mimics. The only difference in meiofauna diversity was observed on natural seagrass shoots. On natural leaves, a shift in dominant harpacticoid species was found, however, community structure did not significantly differ. On the natural seagrass shoots, on the other hand, nematode communities showed a significant change in community structure and species dominance. The short-term colonisation experiment on seagrass mimics showed changes in the harpacticoid community structure at the seepage site; while the nematode community structure, showed no difference, only a change in species dominance was observed. In general, a rather remarkable lack of strong meiofaunal response to the reduced pH may be depended on indirect consequences of CO2 leakage, such as increased seagrass productivity, seasonal organic matter input and reduced macrofaunal predation, in addition to the species specific reactions to environmental disturbance. Since similar research has not been carried out in the shallow-water environment before, further studies are suggested to gain better knowledge of the adaption of meiofauna to the low pH/high CO2 world.

Intuitively, a “common species” is a species that is abundant in a certain area, widespread and at low risk of extinction. Analysing and classifying species commonness can help discovering indicators of ecosystem status and can prevent sudden changes in biodiversity. However, it is challenging to quantitatively define this concept. This paper presents a procedure to automatically characterize species commonness from biological surveys. Our approach uses clustering analysis techniques and is based on a number of numerical parameters extracted from an authoritative source of biodiversity data, i.e. the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The analysis takes into account abundance, geographical and temporal aspects of species distributions. We apply our model to North Sea fish species and show that the classification agrees with independent expert opinion although sampling biases affect the data. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to noise in the data and is promising in classifying new species. Our method can be used in conservation biology, especially to reduce the effects of the sampling biases which affect large biodiversity collections.","Coro, G.; Webb, T.J.; Appeltans, W.; Bailly, N.; Cattrijsse, A.; Pagano, P.",WOS:000358469200025,"Bailly, Nicolas, N.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.05.033,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We mapped potential distribution patterns under present and future conditions for a community with three trophic levels. We analysed climate-induced changes in the species' distribution patterns and examined possible consequences for the chosen food web.    Location: Baltic Sea and northern Europe.    Methods: We developed two open-source workflow-based analytical tools: one for ecological niche modelling and another for raster layer comparison to compute the extent and intensity of change in species' potential distributions. Individual ecological niche models were generated under present conditions and then projected into a future climate change scenario (2050) for a food web consisting of a guild of meso-grazers (Idotea spp.), their host algae (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> and <i>Fucus radicans</i>) and their fish predator (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>). We used occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), literature and museum collections, together with five environmental layers at a resolution of 5 and 30 arc-minutes.    Results: Habitat suitability for <i>Idotea balthica</i> and <i>Idotea chelipes</i> in the Baltic Sea seems to be mostly determined by temperature and ice cover rather than by salinity. 2050 predictions for all modelled species show a northern/north-eastern shift in the Baltic Sea. The distribution ranges for <i>Idotea granulosa</i> and <i>G. aculeatus</i> are predicted to become patchier in the Baltic than in the rest of northern Europe, where the species will gain more suitable habitats.    Main conclusions: For the Baltic Sea, climate-induced changes resulted in a gain of suitable habitats for <i>F. vesiculosus, I. chelipes</i> and <i>I. balthica</i>, whereas lower habitat suitability was predicted for <i>I. granulosa, F. radicans</i> and <i>G. aculeatus</i>. The predicted north-eastern shift of <i>I. balthica</i> and <i>I. chelipes</i> into the distribution area of F. radicans in the Baltic Sea may result in increased grazing pressure. Such additional threats to isolated Baltic populations can lead to a higher extinction risk for the species, especially as climate changes are likely to be very rapid.

The eastern Mediterranean is naturally oligotrophic, but recent urbanization of the Israeli coastal plain has enriched the littoral environment by injection of large amounts of treated wastewater onto the shelf. The largest point source is the Dan region wastewater project (Shafdan). Taxonomy and species rank order of abundance of modern (sediment-top) death assemblages were compared to live-collected mollusk assemblages, from two clean control stations (PL29, PL64) and a polluted site (PL3), near the Shafdan sewage sludge outlet at 36 m water depth. Seasonal variability was captured by dredge and box-core sampling in winter (January), spring (May), summer (July) and fall (November) of 2012.Over 11,000 individuals of bivalves and gastropods were collected and analyzed. Diversity indices and nMDS and cluster analysis showed significant differences between live and dead assemblages from all stations and seasons. However, the rank order of the abundant live and dead species remained similar at each sampling station, resulting in high live–dead agreement of Jaccard-Chao index and Spearman's rho similarity coefficient. Live–dead agreement of molluscan assemblages was preserved in the Shafdan area by the naturally high abundance of species that are tolerant to pollution, and by the annual dispersion of the sludge by winter storms, which prevent development of long-term anoxia. Moreover, the high frequency of storms in the winter of 2012 prevented a substantial amount of sludge from accumulating on the seafloor, explaining the similarity between the live assemblages of the polluted and the control sampling sites. Live–dead agreement is a test that is too conservative to track the impact of the Shafdan sludge on the macrobenthic fauna in the Israeli shelf. Other tests, especially the increase in the abundance of deposit-feeding pollution-tolerant species in the live assemblage, show that there is an ongoing impact of the sludge on the benthic community.","Leshno, Y.; Edelman-Furstenberg, Y.; Mienis, H.K.; Benjamini, C.",WOS:000358466400004,"Edelman-Furstenberg, Y.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.05.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Mollusca; Live-dead analysis; Eutrophication; Anthropogenicmodification; Paleoecology; Israeli eastern Mediterranean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crustaceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Micro-organisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although the composition of the microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum characteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organisms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters themselves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world’s oceans, rafting dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species.","Kiessling, T.; Gutow, L.; Thiel, M.",NULL,"Gutow, Lars, L.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_6,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Biogeography,NULL,Anthropogenic flotsam; Rafting community; Succession; Biological invasions; Plastic pollution ,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

On the basis of datasets from four Mediterranean hard substrate sites and by using the most abundant polychaete family (Syllidae), two questions are addressed in this study: (a) Is the biodiversity sampled in the two NaGISA sites, based on the family Syllidae, representative of the regional one of the Mediterranean Sea? (b) Are local syllid taxo-communities assembled at random from the regional species pool? Randomisation tests determining to what extent local species lists and their phylogenetic relationships are assembled at random from a regional one showed that at small observational scales (e.g. replicate units, depths) the phylogenetic diversity is assembled at random from the one known to exist locally. It is assumed, therefore, that local processes here have a stronger influence on community assembly than historical-evolutionary processes. The latter is in accordance with previous results derived from using polychaetes to test the same hypotheses at a pan-European level. Local syllid biodiversity in the western Mediterranean is a random subset of the Mediterranean one, whereas that of the NaGISA sites in the eastern Mediterranean is only under certain conditions. Therefore, the currently observed biodiversity of the Mediterranean sites can be considered as representative of that of the entire regional sea only under certain assumptions, as far as the syllid taxo-communities are concerned, demonstrating the potential of the taxon as a surrogate of the polychaete biodiversity.","Chatzigeorgiou, G.; Faulwetter, S.; López, E.; Sardá, R.; Arvanitidis, C.",WOS:000304565100014,"Faulwetter, Sarah, S.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-012-1065-5,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",Mediterranean,"Polychaeta, ""Syllidae""",NULL,NULL,Taxonomic distinctness; Biodiversity surrogate; Community assembly,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this chapter, the state of knowledge in several aspects of deep-sea cephalopod research are summarized, including information sources for these animals, diversity and general biogeography and life cycles, including reproduction. Recommendations are made for addressing some of the remaining knowledge deficiencies using a variety of traditional and more recently developed methods. The types of oceanic gear that are suitable for collecting cephalopod specimens and images are reviewed. Many groups of deep-sea cephalopods require taxonomic reviews, ideally based on both morphological and molecular characters. Museum collections play a vital role in these revisions, and novel (molecular) techniques may facilitate new use of old museum specimens. Fundamental life-cycle parameters remain unknown for many species; techniques developed for neritic species that could potentially be applied to deep-sea cephalopods are discussed. Reproductive tactics and strategies in deep-sea cephalopods are very diverse and call for comparative evolutionary and experimental studies, but even in the twenty-first century, mature individuals are still unknown for many species. New insights into diet and trophic position have begun to reveal a more diverse range of feeding strategies than the typically voracious predatory lifestyle known for many cephalopods. Regular standardized deep-sea cephalopod surveys are necessary to provide insight into temporal changes in oceanic cephalopod populations and to forecast, verify and monitor the impacts of global marine changes and human impacts on these populations.","Hoving, H.-J.; Perez, J.A.A.; Bolstad, K.S.R.; Braid, H.E.; Evans, A.B.; Fuchs, D.; Judkins, H.; Kelly, J.T.; Marian, J.E.A.R.; Nakajima, R.; Piatkowski, U.; Reid, A.; Vecchione, M.; Xavier, J.C.C.",WOS:000337493800004,"Piatkowski, Uwe, U.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-800287-2.00003-2,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Cephalopoda,"Biogeography, ""Deep sea"", ""Evolution"", ""Longevity"", ""Reproduction""",NULL,Diversity; Collection methods; Trophic ecology,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

It contains the same indicators, i.e. species richness, Shannon index and AMBI, as in the multivariate m-AMBI. The latter MMI has been adopted by several European countries in the context of WFD implementation. In contrast to m-AMBI, the BEQI2 calculation procedure has been strongly simplified and consists of two steps, i.e. the separate indicator values are normalized using their long-term reference values resulting in three Ecological Quality Ratios (EQRs), which are subsequently averaged to give one BEQI2 value. Using this method only small numbers of samples need to be analysed by Dutch benthos laboratories annually, without the necessity to co-analyse a larger historical dataset. BEQI2 EQR values appeared to correlate quantitatively very well with m-AMBI EQR values. In addition, a data pooling procedure has been added to the BEQI2 tool which enables the pooling of small core samples (0.01–0.025 m<sup>2</sup>) into larger standardized data pools of 0.1 m<sup>2</sup> in order to meet the data requirements of the AMBI indicator and to obtain comparable reference values. Furthermore, the BEQI2 tool automatically and efficiently converts species synonym names into standardized species names. The BEQI2 tool has been applied to all Dutch benthos data monitored by Rijkswaterstaat in the period of 1991–2010 in the transitional and coastal waters and salt lakes and these results are reported here for the first time. Reference values for species richness and Shannon index (99 percentile values) and AMBI reference values (1 percentile values) were estimated for all water body–ecotopes and are discussed. BEQI2 results for all these water bodies are discussed in view of natural and human pressures.

249767,2015,M,Impact of climate-induced dynamics on a coastal benthic ecosystem from the West Antarctic Peninsula,"<b>Pasotti, F.</b> (2015). Impact of climate-induced dynamics on a coastal benthic ecosystem from the West Antarctic Peninsula. PhD Thesis. Ghent University. Marine Biology Research Group: Ghent.  243 pp.","Climate change is globally recognized to pose a serious threat to sustainable human development and to the future of our planet. Both the palaeoclimate and the recent global warming have exhibited larger magnitude of effects on both polar regions (the so-called polar amplification), with some areas showing increases in mean air temperatures double that of the global average at both poles. In the Antarctic there is a strong regional pattern in the effects of climate change. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, the area hosting the highest biodiversity of the whole Antarctic continent, is one of the fastest warming (and changing) regions of the planet, whereas the continental Antarctic presents a general cooling trend. In the WAP air temperatures have increased in both summer and winter (1950-2001: summer + 2.4 ± 1.7°C century-1, autumn +6.2 ± 6.0°C century-1), the sea ice (land fastened ice – or fast ice – versus drift and “pack” ice) ‘season’ and extent have dramatically reduced and more than 87% of the WAP glaciers have actively retreated in the past decades. The increases in glacier retreat observed since as early as the 1930-1950s are coupled to intense summer glacial discharge (e.g. via glacial melt waters), snow and permafrost melting and related effects on coastal sea water turbidity and salinity. Moreover, the decrease in fast ice season has led to higher frequency of iceberg scouring, the major driver of Antarctic shelf biodiversity. All these processes affect the marine coastal communities with direct and indirect effects. The increase in intensity of the observed changes in the WAP appears to fall yet among the natural variability of the past 380-2000 years of climatic history of the region, but anthropogenic drivers are foreseen to become more important in the whole continent by the end of 21st century. Therefore, the understanding of biological responses to the WAP the recent environmental change context represents a fundamental baseline for the deepening of our knowledge on benthic assemblages ecology and their resilience to likely future changes. In this study we investigated the benthic assemblage of Potter Cove (PC), a fjord-like embayment located on the southern coast of King George Island (KGI, South Shetland Islands, WAP). The cove is experiencing strong environmental changes and rapid glacier retreat has influenced the cove since the 1950’s. Potter Cove benthic assemblages are shaped by the interaction of iceberg scour, which can affect the benthos down to 20 m depth, sediment-laden melt water discharge and wave action. Recently community shifts have been reported in the cove for macroepibenthic assemblages. With the present study we focused on the shallow soft-bottom meio- and macrobenthos, and we deepened our investigation by looking at the important microbiota (prokariotes and microphytobenthos) assemblage, which is involved in the basal biogeochemical processes that model and characterize the sediment environment in which these metazoans live. In a spatial analysis we identified three contrasting sites (with different glacier retreat-related history), and investigated three size classes of organisms (microbiota, meio- and macrofauna) and interpreted their assemblage structure in light of their different turnover rates, feeding strategies and dispersal potential, making inferences on the historical influences of the glacier retreat on the resident benthic communities and detecting possible size-related biological responses. With a temporal analysis of the in situ meiofauna standing stocks we looked at possible effects of seasonality on the main meiofauna organisms. Moreover we contributed to the interpretation of these results by means of laboratory experiments to unravel potential effects of distinct glacial-related environmental stressors on PC meiobenthos (see Fig. 1). In the first study (Chapter II) we investigated three size classes of benthic biota (microbenthos, meiofauna and macrofauna) at three shallow water stations (each at a depth of 15 m) in the inner cove, which are influenced by different glacial, meltwater, and water current conditions. Isla D (62° 13' 32.6"" S, 58° 38' 32"" W) is the most recently ice-free area, being exposed since 2003, and situated about 200-215 m away from the glacier front. Faro station (62° 13' 32.6"" S, 58° 40' 03.7""W) is situated on the northern side of the cove and became ice-free between 1988 and 1995. It is an area that is characterized by low ice disturbance and it is affected by wave action. The third station, “Creek” station was located adjacent to “Potter Creek” (62° 13‘ 57.3"" S, 58° 39’ 25.9"" W). This location has been ice-free since the early 1950s and is influenced by a meltwater river that forms during summer. It is also an area where the impact of growler ice, which can scour the benthos in PC up to a depth of 20 m (Kowalke and Abele, 1998; Sahade et al., 1998b). Such a study across different size spectra of the benthos is unique for the Antarctic shallow water marine environment. Our results revealed the presence of a patchy distribution of highly divergent benthic assemblages within a relatively small area (about 1 km2). In areas with frequent ice scouring and higher sediment accumulation rates, an assemblage mainly dominated by macrobenthic scavengers (such as the polychaete Barrukia cristata), vagile organisms, and younger individuals of sessile species (such as the bivalve Yoldia eightsi) was found. Macrofauna were low in abundance and very patchily distributed in recently ice-free areas close to the glacier, whereas the pioneer nematode genus Microlaimus reached a higher relative abundance in these newly exposed sites. The most diverse and abundant macrofaunal assemblage was found in areas most remote from recent glacier influence. By contrast the meiofauna showed relatively low densities in these areas. The three benthic size classes appeared to respond in different ways to disturbances likely related to ice retreat, suggesting that the capacity to adapt and colonize habitats is dependent on both body size and specific life traits. Chapter III was a continuation of the first investigation where we focused on the trophic interactions happening at these contrasting locations. We compared the meio- and macrofauna isotopic niche widths (d13C and d15N stable isotope analysis) by means of new generation Bayesian-based statistical approaches. The isotopic niches appeared to be locally shaped by the different degrees of glacier retreat-related disturbance observed within the cove. The retreat of the glacier seems to favor wider isotopic niches lowering initial local competition. The retreat of the ice is known to provide for new available resource pools via macroalgae colonization and likely punctual enhanced sea ice algae sedimentation. An intermediate-high and continuous state of glacial disturbance (e.g. ice-growlers) allows new species and new life strategies to settle during repeated colonization processes. The smaller benthic organisms (e.g. meiofauna) seemed to be the primary colonizers of these disturbed sediments, showing a wider isotopic niche. Ice-scour and glacial impact hence can play a two-fold role within the cove: i) they either stimulate trophic diversity by allowing continuous re-colonizations of meiobenthic species or, ii) in time, they may force the benthic assemblages into a more compacted trophic structure with increased level of connectedness and resource recycling. To conclude the in field work, in Chapter IV we investigated the seasonal responses of the meiobenthic assemblage at two shallow sites, located on the opposite shores of the inner Potter Cove (North Barton Peninsula versus South Potter Peninsula). We focused on responses to summer/winter biogeochemical conditions. Meiofaunal densities were found to be higher in summer and lower in winter, although this result was not significantly related to the in situ availability of organic matter in each season. The combination of food quality and competition for food amongst higher trophic levels may have played a role in determining the standing stocks at the two sites. Meiobenthic winter abundances were sufficiently high (always above 1000 individuals per 10 cm2) to infer that energy sources were not limiting during winter, supporting observations from other studies for both shallow water and continental shelf Antarctic ecosystems. Recruitment within meiofaunal communities was coupled to the local seasonal dynamics for harpacticoid copepods but not for nematodes, suggesting that species-specific life history or trophic features form an important element of the responses observed. The experimental part of the thesis starts with a tracer experiment (Chapter V). Antarctic meiofauna trophic position in the food web is to date still poorly studied. Primary producers, such as phytoplankton, and bacteria may represent important food sources for shallow water metazoans and the role of meiobenthos in the benthic-pelagic coupling represents an important brick for food web understanding. In a laboratory feeding experiment 13C-labelled freeze-dried diatoms (Thalassiosira weissflogii) and bacteria were added to retrieved cores from Potter Cove (15 m depth, November 2007) in order to investigate the uptake by 3 main meiofauna taxa: nematodes, copepods and cumaceans. In the surface sediment layers nematodes showed no real difference in uptake of both food sources. This outcome was supported by the natural d13C values and the community genus composition. In the first centimeter layer, the dominant genus was Daptonema which is known to be opportunistic, feeding on both bacteria and diatoms. Copepods and cumaceans on the other hand appeared to feed more on diatoms than on bacteria. This may point at a better adaptation to input of primary production from the water column. On the other hand, the overall carbon uptake of the given food sources was quite low for all taxa, indicating that likely other food sources might be of relevance for these meiobenthic organisms. Chapter VI deals with the possible effects of climate change-related increases in inorganic sedimentation, mechanical disturbance and changes in food quality by means of two laboratory experiments: i) the effect of inorganic sedimentation (SED) on the vertical distribution of the meiofauna and ii) the effects of sediment displacement and different types of food (SEL) on the composition of meiobenthic and nematode assemblages in surface sediments. In the SED experiment there was no effect of the sediment load and variances in the densities were too high to allow any deeper understanding. In the SEL experiment the mechanical disturbance mimicked during the collection of the natural sediment caused significant losses in the densities of nauplii and copepods, which may have escaped or showed to be sensitive to this type of disturbance. Among the nematode assemblage, Aponema had an overall increase in relative abundance in the experimental units, benefiting of the sediment mechanical re-working. The different kind of detritus given in the microcosm (shredded macroalgae, the benthic diatom Seminavis robusta and the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana) did not result in significant differences among treatments in terms of meiofaunacomposition at higher taxon level. The nematode assemblage however, was dominated by epistrate feeders in the control and the S. robusta treatments resembling the natural background nematode assemblage. The macroalgae and the haptophyte detritus seemed to stimulate the presence of non-selective deposit feeders. The genus Sabatieria reached the highest relative abundance in these samples compared to both the other treatment and the background sediments, possibly because of increased hypoxic conditions in the presence of this type of detritus. Unfortunately, the high variances found in the experimental units hindered the finding of unequivocal effects on the nematode assemblages in both experiments. The data obtained in the current study indicates that Potter Cove’s shallow benthos is responding to in situ glacial retreat with structural (biomass and taxonomic composition) and functional (isotopic niche width) changes and that meiofaunal organisms appear to be the most resilient size class. Glacier retreat-related impacts on biological communities, hence, depend on the affected organisms turnover (recruitment potential), dispersal potential (capacity of re-colonisation or local migration), motility (avoidance of ice scour impact) and dietary flexibility (resilience to overall disturbances). The meiofauna, being connected to both the detritus and microorganisms on the one hand and the macrofauna on the other, displays a higher resilience to disturbance in light of an intrinsic size-dependent centrality in the overall benthic food web and the high trophic redundancy found between species of important taxons (e.g. nematodes). Inorganic sedimentation per se does not affect meiofauna abundances. Nematodes and copepods seem resilient to this disturbance. Fresh phytoplanktonic detritus may have positive effects on their abundance. Food quality changes (increase in macroalgae detritus and more accessible soft-celled phytoplankton flagellates) can stimulate bacterial degradation within the sediment and initiate short-term community shifts in the nematofauna with genera like Sabatieria or Halalaimus becoming more abundant. Abundances can be temporally negatively affected, especially those of oxygen sensitive taxa (e.g. harpacticoid copepods). Ice scour seems to have a negative effect on nematode selective feeders relative abundance. Ice scour and wind-driven re-suspension are very important disturbances with both “positive” and “negative” effects on the benthos, with wind affecting depths of up to 30 m during strong storms events. Iceberg scouring is the main driver of biodiversity in the Antarctic shelf since it increases the spatial heterogeneity and allow more species with different life strategies to co-exist in rather restricted areas. Anyhow, increases in their frequency are likely to become detrimental to most macrobenthic species, with overall strong influences, but not catastrophic consequences, for the highly detritus based meiobenthic assemblage. Meiofauna represents a pioneer size-class for newly ice-free, heavily scoured soft-bottoms, where wind-driven re-suspension is lower. Macrofauna is a poorer competitor at high disturbances but increases its dominance at intermediate-low disturbance levels. In the second situation competition for resources between meiofauna and macrofauna may become more important in shaping their relative community structure and the food web. Future scenarios in Antarctic marine ecosystems such as PC foresee a more or less rapid stop in iceberg scouring due to a complete withdraw of the glacier on land and a gradual decrease in melt water discharge parallel to KGI ice mass loss generated by the increasing temperatures. Therefore in the future wind speed-related wave action might be the only structuring force enacting on PC benthic communities, but to date there are no evidences of its direct effects on these organisms. In light of the important structuring effect of iceberg scouring and the highly hierarchical competition of Antarctic benthic assemblages, in the absence of this forcing, we might expect, on the longer term, a general decrease in macrobenthic resilience (both resistance to changes and recovery after disturbance), but a rather unchanged (although fluctuating on the short term) resilience for the meiobenthic assemblage.","Pasotti, F.",NULL,"Pasotti, Francesca, F.","Marine Biology Department, Ghent University",NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

In this manuscript we review the effects of global and local stressors on European seaweeds, their communities, and ecosystem functioning. Following a brief review on the present knowledge on European seaweed diversity and distribution, and the role of seaweed communities in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, we discuss the effects of biotic homogenization (invasive species) and global climate change (shifts in bioclimatic zones and ocean acidification) on the distribution of individual species and their effect on the structure and functioning of seaweed communities. The arrival of new introduced species (that already account for 5–10% of the European seaweeds) and the regional extirpation of native species resulting from oceans' climate change are creating new diversity scenarios with undetermined functional consequences. Anthropogenic local stressors create additional disruption often altering dramatically assemblage's structure. Hence, we discuss ecosystem level effects of such stressors like harvesting, trampling, habitat modification, overgrazing and eutrophication that impact coastal communities at local scales. Last, we conclude by highlighting significant knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to anticipate the combined effects of global and local stressors on seaweed communities.

In this paper we presentsuch a validation experiment for the incorporation of 13C and 15N in the blood plasma of amedium-sized shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus canutus), consuming a chemosymbioticlucinid bivalve (Loripes lucinalis). Because this bivalve forms a symbiosis with chemoautotrophicsulphide-oxidizing bacteria living inside its gill, the bivalve is isotopically distinctfrom ‘normal’ bivalves whose food has a photosynthetic basis. Here we experimentallytested the hypothesis that isotope discrimination and incorporation dynamics are differentwhen consuming such chemosynthesis-based prey. The experiment showed that neitherthe isotopic discrimination factor, nor isotopic turnover time, differed between birds consumingthe chemosymbiotic lucinid and a control group consuming a photosynthesis-basedbivalve. This was true for 13C as well as for 15N. However, in both groups the 15N discriminationfactor was much higher than expected, which probably had to do with the birds losingbody mass over the course of the experiment.","van Gils, J.A.; Ahmedou Salem, M.V.",WOS:000362961100026,"van Gils, Jan, J.A.","Department of Marine Ecology, NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research",https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140221,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Ten types of nematocysts (stinging cells) are identified in siphonophores, more than in any other cnidarian; these are incorporated into batteries in the side branches of the tentacles in most species (here termed tentilla), and tentilla are reviewed in the last section of this paper. Their discharge mechanisms are explained and also how the tentilla of several physonect siphonophores are modified into lures.

Presence-absence data of Hydrozoa in the Arctic were prepared on the basis of historical and present-day literature. The Arctic was divided into ecoregions.

The similarity of species composition among regions was calculated with the Bray-Curtis index. Average and variation in taxonomic distinctness were used to measure diversity at the taxonomic level. A total of 268 species were recorded. Arctic-boreal species were the most common and dominated each studied region. Nineteen percent of species were restricted to the Arctic. There was a predominance of benthic species over holo- and meroplanktonic species.

This paper investigates the hypothesised link based on a field sampling approach of intertidal biogenic aggregations created by the ecosystem engineer <em>Lanice conchilega</em> (Polychaeta, Terebellidae). The aggregations are known to have a considerable impact on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of their environment and subsequently on the abundance and biomass of primary food sources and the macrofaunal (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>. the macro-, hyper- and epibenthos) community. Therefore, we hypothesise that <em>L</em>. <em>conchilega</em> aggregations affect the structure, stability and isotopic niche of the consumer assemblage of a soft-bottom intertidal food web. Primary food sources and the bentho-pelagic consumer assemblage of a <em>L</em>. <em>conchilega</em> aggregation and a control area were sampled on two soft-bottom intertidal areas along the French coast and analysed for their stable isotopes. Despite the structural impacts of the ecosystem engineer on the associated macrofaunal community, the presence of <em>L</em>. <em>conchilega</em> aggregations only has a minor effect on the food web structure of soft-bottom intertidal areas. The isotopic niche width of the consumer communities of the <em>L</em>. <em>conchilega</em> aggregations and control areas are highly similar, implying that consumer taxa do not shift their diet when feeding in a <em>L</em>. <em>conchilega</em> aggregation.

These include human health, the safe and sustained use of marine resources and the ecological status of the marine environment, including long-term changes under the impact of multiple stressors. The analysis of phytoplankton data collected at the same place over time, as well as the comparison among different sampling sites, provide key information for assessing environmental change, and evaluating new actions that must be made to reduce human induced pressures on the environment. To achieve these aims, phytoplankton data may be used several decades later by users that have not participated in their production, including automatic data retrieval and analysis. The methods used in phytoplankton species analysis vary widely among research and monitoring groups, while quality control procedures have not been implemented in most cases. Here we highlight some of the main differences in the sampling and analytical procedures applied to phytoplankton analysis and identify critical steps that are required to improve the quality and inter-comparability of data obtained at different sites and/or times. Harmonization of methods may not be a realistic goal, considering the wide range of purposes of phytoplankton time-series data collection. However, we propose that more consistent and detailed metadata and complementary information be recorded and made available along with phytoplankton time-series datasets, including description of the procedures and elements allowing for a quality control of the data. To keep up with the progress in taxonomic research, there is a need for continued training of taxonomists, and for supporting and complementing existing web resources, in order to allow a constant upgrade of knowledge in phytoplankton classification and identification. Efforts towards the improvement of metadata recording, data annotation and quality control procedures will ensure the internal consistency of phytoplankton time series and facilitate their comparability and accessibility, thus strongly increasing the value of the precious information they provide. Ultimately, the sharing of quality controlled data will allow one to recoup the high cost of obtaining the data through the multiple use of the time-series data in various projects over many decades.","Zingone, A.; Harrison, P.J.; Kraberg, A.; Lehtinen, S.; McQuatters-Gollop, A.; O'Brien, T.; Sun, J.; Jakobsen, H.H.",WOS:000360774700016,"Zingone, Adriana, A.","Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Integrat Marine Ecol Dept, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2015.05.024,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Metadata, ""Methodology"", ""Phytoplankton"", ""Quality assurance"", ""Quality control"", ""Time series""",NULL,Long Term Ecological Research (LTER); ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The small size and the lack of a planktonic life stage of most meiofauna taxa including free-living nematodes suggest that passive dispersal is a main factor determining their distribution. This study investigates the settling behaviour of meiofauna in a water column under no-flow conditions. Two ex situ settling experiments were conducted with (1) macrophyte associated meiofauna from an intertidal salt marsh and (2) meiofauna of sulphidic sediments associated with bacterial mats from the deep-sea Håkon Mosby mud volcano. Cilyndrical containers filled with sieved seawater were used as settling chambers and five different substrates, placed on the bottom of the containers, were offered to the descending meiofaunal assemblage. The substrates used in experiment 1 were agar with bacteria, agar with <em>Fucus spiralis</em>, sulphidic agar medium, bare agar and an empty Petri dish. For experiment 2 azoic sediment with algae, azoic sediment with bacteria, a sulphidic medium, bare azoic sediment and an empty Petri dish were used. The intertidal experiment revealed that nematodes and nauplius larvae showed four- to tenfold higher densities in the <em>Fucus</em> treatment compared with the controls whereas deep-sea nematode and harpacticoid copepod densities in the sulphide treatment were more than three times higher compared with all other treatments. In both experiments nematode composition did not differ from the reference samples whereas proportions of harpacticoid copepods were increased in the treatments of the deep-sea experiment compared with the reference sample suggesting a better ability to select settlement sites than nematodes. In both experiments meiofauna abundance was highest in substrates with similar characteristics as their original habitat. These findings indicate that some meiofaunal organisms can selectively settle once they are suspended in the water column in the absence of water flow and therefore actively contribute to their dispersal at small spatial scales.","Mevenkamp, L.; Van Campenhout, J.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000366768300026,"Van Campenhout, Jelle, J.","Research Group Marine Biology, Biology Department, Ghent University",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.10.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Halomonhystera, ""Harpacticoida""",Nematodes,NULL,HMMV; Harpacticoid copepods; Active dispersal ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This change was most drastic at the Anoxia 23D and 307D treatments. At both Normoxia and Anoxia 2D treatments, selective deposit feeders (1A), non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and epistrate (diatom) feeders (2A) nematodes were observed in the dominant nematode community. Epistrate feeders disappeared from in the Anoxia 23D treatment epistrate and also selective deposit feeders did not belong to the dominant nematode species in the Anoxia 307D treatment. After the recovery process, epistrate feeders and selective deposit feeding nematodes reappeared again amongst the dominant nematode species after 30 and 90 days of recovery, respectively.","Taheri, M.; Grego, M.; Riedel, B.; Vincx, M.; Vanaverbeke, J.",WOS:000362304700013,"Vanaverbeke, Jan, J.","Ghent University (UGent), Biology Department, Marine Biology Research Group",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.08.004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nematoda,NULL,NULL,    Marine nematodes; Anoxia; Recovery; Community structure; Gulf of Trieste; Adriatic Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This makes it a very powerful tool for taxonomic quality control, and also allows the linking of different pieces of information through scientific names, both within the Aphia platform and in relation to externally hosted databases. Through these LSIDs, Aphia has become an important player in the field of (marine) biodiversity informatics, allowing interactions between its own taxonomic data and e.g., biogeographic databases. Some applications in the field of biodiversity informatics encompass the coupling of species traits and taxonomy, as well as the creation of diverse, expert validated data products that can be used by policy makers, for example.

These distributional trends result in ocean-scale spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming, and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as inferred from present-day species’ distributional ranges, outweighs spatial variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species loss.","Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Edgar, G.J.; Barrett, N.S.; Kininmonth, S.J.; Bates, A.E.",WOS:000365606000053,"Stuart-Smith, Rick, R.D.","Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/nature16144,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Climate Change"", ""Environmental Managers &amp; Monitoring"", ""Exploitable Scientific Result"", ""Oceanography"", ""Policy Makers / Decision Makers"", ""Scientific Community"", ""Scientific Publication""",NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Together with knowledge on biology and ecology, niche models also allow evaluating the potential of species to react to expected changes. The availability of projections of future climate scenarios allows comparing current and future niche distributions, assessing a species’ habitat suitability modification and shift, and consequently estimating potential species’ reaction. In this study, differences between the distribution maps of 406 marine species, which were produced by the AquaMaps niche models on current and future (year 2050) scenarios, were estimated and evaluated. Discrepancy measurements were used to identify a discrete number of categories, which represent different responses to climate change. Clustering analysis was then used to automatically detect these categories, demonstrating their reliability compared to human supervised classification. Finally, the distribution of characteristics like extinction risk (based on IUCN categories), taxonomic groups, population trends and habitat suitability change over the clustering categories was evaluated. In this assessment, direct human impact was neglected, in order to focus only on the consequences of environmental changes. Furthermore, in the comparison between two climate snapshots, the intermediate phases were assumed to be implicitly included into the model of the 2050 climate scenario.","Coro, G.; Magliozzi, C.; Ellenbroek, A.; Kaschner, K.; Pagano, P.",WOS:000375375800008,"Magliozzi, Chiara, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10651-015-0333-8,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,"Climate change, ""GIS""",NULL,AquaMaps; Big Data; Clustering analysis; Ecological niche modelling; Maps comparis; OGC standards; Species distribution maps,Journal article,NULL,NULL

For instance, using reliable absence as much as presence information, species distribution models can enhance their performance and produce more accurate predictions of the distribution of a species. Unfortunately, estimating reliable absence locations is difficult and often requires a deep knowledge of the species’ distribution and of its abiotic and biotic environmental preferences and tolerance. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reconstruct reliable absence information from presence-only information, and the conditions that those presence-only data have to meet to make this possible.Large species occurrence data collections (otherwise called occurrence datasets) contain high quality and expert-reviewed species observation records from scientific surveys. These surveys can be used to retrieve species presence locations, but they also record places where the species in their target list were not observed. Although these absences could be simply due to sampling variation, it is possible to intersect many of these reports to estimate true absence locations, i.e. those due to habitat unsuitability or geographical hindrances. In this paper, we present a method to generate reliable absence locations of this type for marine species, using scientific surveys reports contained in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), an authoritative species occurrence dataset. Our method spatially aggregates information from surveys focussing on the same target species. It detects absence locations for a given species as those locations in which repeated surveys (that included the species of interest in their target list) reported information only on other species. We qualitatively demonstrate the reliability of our method using distribution records of the Atlantic cod as a case study. Additionally, we quantitatively estimate its performance using another authoritative large species occurrence dataset, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). We also demonstrate that our approach has higher accuracy and presents complementary behaviour with respect to another method using environmental envelopes. Our process can support species distribution models (as well as other types of models, e.g. climate change models) by providing reliable data to presence/absence approaches. It can manage regional as well as global scale scenarios and runs within a collaborative e-Infrastructure (D4Science) that publishes it as-a-Service, allowing biologists to reproduce, repeat and share experimental results.","Coro, G.; Magliozzi, C.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Bailly, N.; Ellenbroek, A.; Pagano, P.",WOS:000378100200006,"Magliozzi, Chiara, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.12.008,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Absence locations; Species distribution maps; Occurrence data; Ecological niche modelling; Marine biodiversity; Scientific surveys,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, during 2009, slight symptoms of natural recovery were observed, a process which has since evolved intermittently. This study aims to investigate changes in patterns of nematode density, diversity, and trophic composition between two distinct habitat conditions: “before” the collapse of seagrass beds, and during the early recovery “after” the seagrass habitat loss, through the analysis of: i) temporal and spatial distribution patterns of nematode communities, and ii) the most important environmental variables influencing the nematode assemblages. The following hypotheses were tested: i) there would be differences in nematode assemblage density, biodiversity and trophic composition during both ecological conditions, “before” and “after”; and ii) there would be differences in nematode assemblage density, biodiversity and trophic composition at different sampling occasions during both ecological conditions. Nematode density and diversity were significantly different between the two ecological situations. A higher density was recorded before, but a higher diversity was evident after the collapse of <em>Z</em>. <em>noltii</em>. In spite of the disturbance caused by the seagrass habitat loss in the Mira estuary, the nematode trophic composition did not significantly differ between the before and after seagrass collapse situations. Despite the significant differences found among sampling occasions, a consistent temporal pattern was not evident.

Moreover, global climate change is impacting the marine environment at an unprecedented level, which promotes trophic mismatches that affect the phenology of these species and, ultimately, act as drivers of ecological and evolutionary change. Assessing the trophic ecology of marine invertebrates is critical to understanding maternal investment, larval survival to metamorphosis, post-metamorphic performance, resource partitioning and trophic cascades. Tools already available to assess the trophic ecology of marine invertebrates, including visual observation, gut content analysis, food concentration, trophic markers, stable isotopes and molecular genetics, are reviewed and their main advantages and disadvantages for qualitative and quantitative approaches are discussed. The challenges to perform the partitioning of ingestion, digestion and assimilation are discussed together with different approaches to address each of these processes for short- and long-term fingerprinting.

Interaction of marine pathogens and Harmful Algae (HAB): effect on bivalve recruitment. MSc Thesis. Universiteit Gent: Gent.  VII, 42 pp.","Over the last decades, toxin producing Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a frequent phenomenon on a global scale. This is a major concern, since shellfish get regularly poisoned with phycotoxins and pose serious threats to human health. In addition, it has been shown for a limited number of toxic algal species that HABs can affect the reproductive stages of bivalves. As embryogenesis and larval development are probably the most sensitive life stages, it is crucial to understand these processes. Despite of this, no studies have investigated whether harmful algae and marine pathogens, which have long been known to cause significant losses in bivalves (e.g. summer mortalities), may have interactive effects on bivalves. In this study, embryonic development experiments were performed on larvae of the model organism Mytilus edulis. The potential interactions between HABs and pathogens were investigated by simultaneously exposing mussel larvae to different concentrations of harmful dinoflagellates and pathogenic bacteria of the genus Vibrio during five days. Through this method, the adverse effects of five dinoflagellates and one pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio splendidus, were confirmed. Dinoflagellates were found to have a major impact within the first days of the embryogenesis, while the pathogenic effects were concentrated in the last days. Minor, but significant, interaction effects were found for V. splendidus and three dinoflagellate species. V. coralliilyticus, who didn’t had a significant independent effect, still showed minor interaction effects with two dinoflagellates. Although the contribution of the interaction is limited in comparison to the individual effects, our experimental results suggest that interaction effects do exist and that they are species dependent with regards to the algae. Moreover, it was experimentally demonstrated that HABs can induce pathogenic stress by providing extra organic matter available for bacterial growth. As such, HABs and marine pathogens may contribute to the observed yearly variation in availability of wild bivalve larvae.

Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.","Hattab, T.; Leprieur, F.; Lasram, F.B.R.; Gravel, D.; Le Loc'h, F.; Albouy, C.",WOS:000389304800009,"Le Loc'h, François, F.","CNRS UBO IRD Ifremer, UMR 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin, Rue Dumont DUrville,Technopole Brest Iroise, FR-29280 Plouzane, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.01937,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The only comprehensive species distribution review was published in 2004; since then a considerable amount of novel information has emerged. We compiled 853 sighting, capture and specimen records of the species, and produced global and regional distribution maps. Of the 830 records where year was available, 63.1% dated from = 2005 and confirm a contemporary occurrence in six marine ecoregions and 11 countries: Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo Republic and Angola. Additionally, Togo is a recently confirmed range state. Group sizes ranged from 1 to 45 animals, with small groups of 1 to 10 animals comprising 65% of the sightings. Similarities were noted in the regions inhabited by Atlantic humpback dolphins across their range, particularly an occurrence in relatively shallow (predominantly = 20 m) depths, in warm waters (average SSTs of 15.8–31.8 °C) and in dynamic habitat strongly influenced by tidal patterns. These conditions occur in various habitats occupied by the species, including estuarine systems, open coasts, archipelagos, tidal mud-flats and sheltered bays. Sightings were recorded at distances of 13 m to 12.8 km (mean of 573 m) from land, indicating that the species occurs several kilometres from shore when suitable shallow habitat is present.

However, some microalgal blooms can cause harm to humans and other organisms. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have direct impacts on human health and negative influences on human wellbeing, mainly through their consequences to coastal ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation) and other marine organisms and environments. HABs are natural phenomena, but these events can be favoured by anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas. Global warming and associated changes in the oceans could affect HAB occurrences and toxicity as well, although forecasting the possible trends is still speculative and requires intensive multidisciplinary research. At the beginning of the 21st century, with expanding human populations, particularly in coastal and developing countries, mitigating HABs impacts on human health and wellbeing is becoming a more pressing public health need.

Oceans and Human Health. <i>Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom</i>, 96(1). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. 216 pp.","Marine Biology is undergoing a “sea change” in its outlook and approach. Driven by the need for us all to think more about the impact of our work and its relevance to the wider public, the marine sciences are now embracing ideas and establishing closer collaborative links with the Social Sciences – including economics and the law – , and the public health communities. Until recently the primary focus within these latter areas has been on the negative impacts of the oceans and seas on human health – such as extreme weather events, shellfish poisoning and drowning.  Conversely, in the marine biology/marine science community attention has traditionally been directed to the many benefits  for example, healthy foods and novel drugs as well as some negative environmental impacts (such as red tides).  Now, there is increasing recognition that all interactions both global and local between humans and the oceans can have benefits and risks and that the “health” of our seas and oceans is inextricably linked to human health and wellbeing.  For example, our marine ecosystems are being destroyed through pollution and unsustainable development, which threatens important potential health-related novel drug and foodstuff discoveries.While most of these interactions can be quantified, those surrounding human health and well being need to be explored using qualitative research methods if we are to truly understand the scope of their short and long term impacts.  For example, how can we measure the potentially positive benefits that result from interaction with the coasts and the “blue environment”?  Since the Eighteenth century “taking the waters” was considered to be health promoting and this idea contributed to the growth of the medical “thallasotherapy” approach and industry.  Now, in the 21st Century, we are seeing the emergence of terms such as the “Blue gym”, coined to describe the sometimes indefinable, or at least difficult to quantify, mental and physical health benefits obtained from experiencing proximity to coastal environments.Supporting this vision, an increasing number of disparate groups are realizing that they too are stakeholders in oceans and human health.  This includes residents of rapidly growing coastal cities, the increasing numbers of visitors to seaside locations around the globe and the resulting growth of businesses that serve them such as tourism, aquaculture and fisheries, pharmaceuticals, transport, energy sectors, and non-governmental organizations (e.g. Ocean Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, Surfrider Foundation, Pew Foundation).  The interests of commerce, the wider public, professional bodies and diverse academic disciplines are now converging to develop the field of “Oceans and Human Health”.

They develop complex polypoid colonies and exhibit considerable morphological variation among species with respect to growth, defensive structures and mode of development. For instance, several lineages within this order have lost the medusa stage. Depending on the author, traditional taxonomy in hydrozoans may be either polyp- or medusa-oriented. Therefore, the absence of the latter stage in some lineages may lead to very different classification schemes. Molecular data have proved useful in elucidating this taxonomic challenge. We analyzed a super matrix of new and published rRNA gene sequences (16S, 18S and 28S), employing newly proposed methods to measure branch support and improve phylogenetic signal. Our analysis recovered new clades not recognized by traditional taxonomy and corroborated some recently proposed taxa. We offer a thorough taxonomic revision of the Leptothecata, erecting new orders, suborders, infraorders and families. We also discuss the origination and diversification dynamics of the group from a macroevolutionary perspective.","Maronna, M.M.; Miranda, T.P.; Peña Cantero, A.L.; Barbeitos, M.S.; Marques, A.C.",WOS:000368924600001,"Maronna, Maximiliano, M.M.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep18075,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Leptothecata,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Global climate change is further affecting the distribution of marine species, raising concern for the persistence of biodiversity and presenting additional challenges to fisheries management. However, few studies have attempted to extend bioclimatic projections to assess the socio-economic impacts of climate-induced range shifts. This study investigates the potential implications of changes in relative environmental suitability and fisheries catch potential on UK fisheries by linking species distribution modelling with cost-benefit analyses. We develop scenarios and apply a multimodel approach to explore the economic sensitivity of UK fisheries and key sources of uncertainty in the modelling procedure. We projected changes in maximum potential catch of key species and the resulting responses in terms of net present value (NPV) over a 45-year period under scenarios of change in fuel price, discount rate and government subsidies. Results suggest that total maximum potential catch will decrease within the UK EEZ by 2050, resulting in a median decrease in NPV of 10%. This value decreases further when trends of fuel price change are extrapolated into the future, becoming negative when capacity-enhancing subsidies are removed. Despite the variation in predictions from alternative models and data input, the direction of change in NPV is robust. This study highlights key factors influencing future profitability of UK fisheries and the importance of enhancing adaptive capacity in UK fisheries.","Jones, M.C.; Dye, S.R.; Pinnegar, J.K.; Warren, R.; Cheung, W.W.L.",WOS:000363264400004,"Cheung, William, W.W.L.","Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Changing Ocean Res Unit, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12081,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Climate change; fishery profitability; multimodel approach; scenarios;species distribution modelling; UK waters,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The present-day water depth within the bay slightly exceeds 2 m at low tide and the seafloor is almost entirely muddy, except for the outermost part of the embayment which is directly influenced by the longshore drift that is building the Laem Talumpuk sand spit. A multivariate analysis of the molluscan fauna recovered at 16 sampling stations within the bay delineates three thanatofacies and two biofacies. The Bay Mouth thanatofacies, including several infralittoral species, is distributed around the bay entrance; the Tidal Flat thanatofacies, characterized by few brackish and freshwater taxa, occurs in the inner part of the bay; the Channel thanatofacies includes a mixed fauna and is found along the long axis of the bay. All thanatofacies are not older than a few decades. The two biofacies are significantly less diverse than their dead counterparts, and are simply identified as Bay Mouth biofacies and Inner Bay biofacies. The faunal evolution, combined with bathymetric and sedimentological data, confirms that the embayment is undergoing a confinement process. The inner bay has evolved into an undifferentiated tidal flat hosting an oligospecific fauna. The confinement trend and the consequent siltation of the bay, mainly due to natural geomorphologic processes acting since centuries, are likely to have sped up in recent years by interaction with some human activities: among these, the deforestation in the upper Pak Phanang basin and the construction of Uthokaviphatprasit Watergate.","Negri, M.P.; Sanfilippo, R.; Basso, D.; Rosso, A.; Di Geronimo, S.I.",WOS:000339696200016,"Negri, Mauro Pietro, M.P.","Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2014.04.019,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Benthic; Estuarine environment; Biodiversity; Anthropogenic impact; PakPhanang Bay; Thailand,Journal article,NULL,NULL

According to the regression models performed, these factors can be interpreted as multi-scale filters that determine the occurrence of invasive species, with human degradation potentially affecting the performance of the other two environmental filters. Amongst climate factors, minimum temperature of the coldest month was one of the most important drivers of the occurrence of Europe’s worst freshwater and terrestrial invaders like the red swamp crayfish (<i>Procambarus clarkii</i>), Bermuda buttercup (<i>Oxalis pes-caprae</i>) and Sika deer (<i>Cervus nippon</i>). Water chemistry (alkalinity, pH, nitrate) determines the availability of habitat and resources for species at regional to local levels and was relevant to explain the occurrence of aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders such as the brook trout (<i>Salvalinus fontinallis</i>) and Canada goose (<i>Branta canadensis</i>). Likewise, nitrate and cholorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration were important determinants of marine invaders like the bay barnacle (<i>Balanus improvisus</i>) and green sea fingers (<i>Codium fragile</i>). Most relevant socio-economic predictors included the density of roads, country gross domestic product (GDP), distance to ports and the degree of human influence on ecosystems. These variables were particularly relevant to explain the occurrence of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) and coypu (<i>Myocastor coypu</i>), species usually associated to disturbed environments. The Japanese kelp (<i>Undaria pinnatifida</i>) was generally distributed much closer to ports than the other two marine organisms, although insufficient information on human impacts prevented a correct assessment of the three marine species. In conclusion, this study shows how socio-economic development is associated with the presence of the top 10 worst European invasive species at a continental scale, and relates this fact to the provision and transport of propagules and the degradation of natural habitats that favour the establishment of invasive species.","Gallardo, B.",WOS:000334894200004,"Gallardo, Belinda, B.","Univ Cambridge, Aquat Ecol Grp, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2014.896417,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""EUROBIS ackn - indirect use"", ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,logistic model; human influence index; cold tolerance; Europe; port;road density; country GDP,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, worked beads lose taxonomic clues to identification, and this may be compounded by taphonomic alteration. Consequently, the significance of this key early artefact may be underestimated. We report the use of bulk amino acid composition of the stable intracrystalline proteins preserved in shell biominerals and the application of pattern recognition methods to a large dataset (777 samples) to demonstrate that taxonomic identification can be achieved at genus level. Amino acid analyses are fast (< 2 hours per sample) and micro-destructive (sample size <2 mg). Their integration with non-destructive techniques provides a valuable and affordable tool, which can be used by archaeologists and museum curators to gain insight into early exploitation of natural resources by humans. Here we combine amino acid analyses, macro-and microstructural observations (by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and Raman spectroscopy to try to identify the raw material used for beads discovered at the Early Bronze Age site of Great Cornard (UK).

Geophys. 171(6)</i>: 1013-1027. <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-013-0708-4"" target=""_blank"">dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-013-0708-4</a>","The development of knowledge of global biogeography of the oceans from sixteenthcentury European voyages of exploration to present-day use of satellite remote sensing is reviewed in three parts; the pre-satellite era (1513-1977), the satellite era leading to a first global synthesis (1978-1998), and more recent studies since 1998. The Gulf Stream was first identified as a strong open-ocean feature in 1513 and by the eighteenth century, regular transatlantic voyages by sailing ships had established the general patterns of winds and circulation, enabling optimisation of passage times. Differences in water temperature, water colour and species of animals were recognised as important cues for navigation. Systematic collection of information from ships' logs enabled Maury (The Physical Geography of the Sea Harper and Bros. New York 1855) to produce a chart of prevailing winds across the entire world's oceans, and by the early twentieth century the global surface ocean circulation that defines the major biogeographic regions was well-known. This information was further supplemented by data from large-scale plankton surveys. The launch of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, specifically designed to study living marine resources on board the Nimbus 7 polar orbiting satellite in 1978, marked the advent of the satellite era. Over subsequent decades, correlation of satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll data with in situ measurements enabled Longhurst (Ecological Geography of the Sea. Academic Press, New York 1998) to divide the global ocean into 51 ecological provinces with Polar, Westerly Wind, Trade Wind and Coastal Biomes clearly recognisable from earlier subdivisions of the oceans. Satellite imagery with semi-synoptic images of large areas of the oceans greatly aided definition of boundaries between provinces. However, ocean boundaries are dynamic, varying from season to season and year to year. More recent work has focused on the study of variability of currents, fronts and eddies, which are often the focus of high biological productivity. Direct tracking of animals using satellite-based systems has helped resolve the biological function of such features and indeed animals instrumented in this way have helped the study of such features in three dimensions, including depths beyond the reach of conventional satellite remote sensing. Patterns of surface productivity detected by satellite remote sensing are reflected in deep sea life on the sea floor at abyssal depths > 3,000 m. Satellite remote sensing has played a major role in overcoming the problems of large spatial scales and variability in ocean dynamics and is now an essential tool for monitoring global change.","Priede, I.G.",WOS:000336301700013,"Priede, Imants, I.G.","Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Oceanlab, Aberdeen AB41 6AA, Scotland.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-013-0708-4,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Oceans; biogeography; ocean colour; chlorophyll; CZCS,Journal article,NULL,NULL

As a case study, we use a global dataset of sea turtle nesting sites (n = 2991) to determine the extent to which the existing global PA network encompasses nesting habitats (beaches) that are vital for the persistence of the seven sea turtle species. The majority of nesting sites (87%) are in the tropics, and are mainly hosted by developing countries. Developing countries contain 82% nesting sites, which provide lower protection coverage compared to developed countries. PAs encompass 25% of all nesting sites, of which 78% are in marine PAs. At present, most nesting sites in PAs with IUCN ratification receive high protection. We identified the countries that provide the highest and lowest nesting site protection coverage, and detected gaps in species-level protection effort within countries. No clear trend in protection coverage was found in relation to gross domestic product, the Global Peace Index or sea turtle regional management units; however, countries in crisis (civil unrest, war or natural catastrophes) provided slightly higher protection coverage of all countries. We conclude that global sea turtle resilience against threats spanning temperate to tropical regions require representative PA coverage at the species level within countries.

Owing to the local geographic features, this area has been described as the Venetian lacuna, where Mediterranean Sea climatic conditions are replaced by Atlantic Ocean ones, supporting the presence of glacial relicts, such as sprat <i>Sprattus sprattus</i>, flounder <i>Platichthys flesus</i> and brown shrimp <i>Crangon crangon</i>. Nektonic assemblage therefore represents a good candidate in terms of an early proxy for thermal regime alterations. It represents a dynamic component of the lagoon ecosystem, changing in space and time, actively moving through the entire system, and dynamically exchanging with the open sea. Here, the first signals of the change have been already detected, such as the presence of alien thermophilic species. Within this context, since the beginning of the century, sampling of the nektonic assemblage has been carried out, integrating them with landings data from the fish market. Vulnerabilities to thermal regime changes have been tested by (1) categorizing species according to the mean distribution area in terms of latitudinal range (over 45°, 30°–45° and below 30°), and (2) analysing both spatial and temporal variations within fishing grounds. Results indicated a high potential vulnerability of the artisanal fishery to climate change, as the commercial catch is entirely composed of species from cold (> 45° N) and temperate (between 45° and 30° N) latitudes. At present no alien thermophilic species have been recorded within the lagoon, which is possibly a sign of good resilience of the assemblage. Finally, abundance of species from cold latitudes has decreased during the past decade.

Few studies to date have applied ENM and SDM to marine ecosystems, and those that have treated the marine environment as a two-dimensional space owing to limitations of the implementations of current ENM/SDM tools. For many marine organisms, ENM/SDM should be performed in three-dimensional space, taking into account latitude, longitude and depth. We present a case study demonstrating a strategy for three-dimensional ENM/SDM. Location Open ocean; global. Methods We decompose the three-dimensional structure of marine environmental and species occurrence data into a series of two-dimensional spaces using an easy-to-implement transformation, after which existing ENM/SDM tools can be used to analyse the data. We demonstrate our approach by modelling the potential distribution of a deep-sea-dwelling jellyfish with two commonly used algorithms. Potential effects of missing data and spatial sampling biases were assessed using resampling approaches. Results We demonstrate that it is feasible to derive predictive models of three-dimensional distributions of marine species using existing software tools developed with two-dimensional terrestrial situations in mind. The strategy presented here allowed us to model the distribution of a jellyfish species that inhabits the deep sea.

It was also associated with a dramatic, long-lasting change in sedimentation style along the margins of the Tethys Ocean, from generally organic-matter-poor sediments during the Triassic to generally organic-matter-rich black shales during the Jurassic. New core material from Germany provides biomarker evidence of persistent photic-zone euxinia during the Hettangian, the onset of which is associated with a series of both negative and positive carbon isotope excursions. Combined inorganic and organic geochemical and micropalaeontological analyses reveal strong similarities between the Hettangian and the better-known Toarcian anoxic event. These events appear to be the most clearly expressed events within a series of anoxic episodes that also include poorly studied black shale intervals during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian. Both the Hettangian and Toarcian events are marked by important changes in phytoplankton assemblages from chromophyte- to chlorophyte-dominated assemblages within the European Epicontinental Seaway. Phytoplankton changes occurred in association with the establishment of photic-zone euxinia, driven by a general increase in salinity stratification and warming of surface waters. For both events, the causes of large negative carbon isotope excursions remain incompletely understood; evidence exists for both variation in the d<sup>13</sup>C of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and variation in the sources of organic carbon. Regardless of the causes of d<sup>13</sup>C variability, long-term ocean anoxia during the Early Jurassic can be attributed to greenhouse warming and increased nutrient delivery to the oceans triggered by flood basalt volcanism.","van de Schootbrugge, B.; Bachan, A.; Suan, G.; Richoz, S.; Payne, J.L.",WOS:000321832100002,"van de Schootbrugge, Bas, B.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Geosci, Palaeoenvironm Dynam Grp, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pala.12034,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Jurassic; carbon cycle; anoxic events; phytoplankton,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The premises of studies concerned with dispersal, on issues as diverse as marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries and invasive species, commonly make simplified assumptions linking larval development mode (planktotrophic, lecithotrophic) and pelagic propagule duration (PPD) or pelagic larval duration. Because general empirical tests of these connections have yielded equivocal results, we critically examined the relationship between larval mode and PPD in light of regional and taxon-specific criteria. Location Oceans world-wide. Methods We collated data from 190 species from the phylum Echinodermata and used two-way and one-way ANOVA to compare PPD among larval modes, taxonomic classes, geographic regions and climate zones. We also assessed the contribution of egg size, temperature and other continuous predictors using multiple regressions and ANCOVA, and examined whether geographic range size differed among larval modes. Results Our results depart from the common assumption that planktotrophs have longer PPDs than lecithotrophs. Instead, we detected a synergistic influence of phylogeny and climate. No significant difference in PPD between planktotrophs and lecithotrophs occurred in two of the four classes and only four out of nine major ocean basins contained species with significantly different PPDs on the basis of larval mode. Species from colder climates displayed relatively constant PPDs regardless of larval mode, whereas temperate and warm-water species displayed a clearer dichotomy. PPD did not correlate with geographic range size nor did planktotrophs and lecithotrophs exhibit significantly different range sizes. Main conclusions Our findings indicate that larval mode is not a reliable predictor of PPD across broad geographic and taxonomic scales. Instead developmental strategies may instigate shorter or longer PPDs in schemes that are influenced by evolutionary and environmental pressures.","Mercier, A.; Sewell, M.A.; Hamel, J.-F.",WOS:000317673200001,"Mercier, Annie, A.","Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ctr Ocean Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12018,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Echinodermata,NULL,NULL,Benthic invertebrates; dispersal; echinoderms; larval development;lecithotrophy; oceans; planktotrophy; propagules; range size;reproductive strategy,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Extensive reviews of the literature and manipulative experiments suggest that mangroves will be impacted by climate change, but few studies have tested these predictions over large scales using statistical models. We provide the first example of applying species and community distribution models (SDMs and CDMs, respectively) to coastal mangroves worldwide. Species distributions were modeled as ensemble forecasts using BIOMOD. Distributions of mangrove communities with high species richness were modeled in three ways: as the sum of the separate SDM outputs, as binary hotspots (with >3 species) using a generalized linear model, and continuously using a general boosted model. Individual SDMs were projected for 12 species with sufficient data and CDMs were projected for 30 species into 2080 using global climate model outputs and a range of sea-level rise projections. Species projected to shift their ranges polewards by at least 2 degrees of latitude consistently experience a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them. Central America and the Caribbean are forecast to lose more mangrove species than other parts of the world. We found that the extent and grain size, at which continuous CDM outputs are examined, independent of the grain size at which the models operate, can dramatically influence the number of pseudo-absences needed for optimal parameterization. The SDMs and CDMs presented here provide a first approximation of how mangroves will respond to climate change given simple correlative relationships between occurrence records and environmental data. Additional, precise georeferenced data on mangrove localities and concerted efforts to collect data on ecological processes across large-scale climatic gradients will enable future research to improve upon these correlative models.","Record, S.; Charney, N.D.; Zakaria, R.M.; Ellison, A.M.",WOS:000327307300003,"Record, S.","Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES12-00296.1,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,climate envelope; community; global; mangal; sea-level rise; speciesrichness,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences.ResultsSpecies distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being <i>Nucella lapillus</i>, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America.Main conclusionsMarine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences.

Such range shifts raise concern for species whose long-term persistence is already threatened by other human disturbances such as fishing. However, few studies have attempted to assess the effects of future climate change on threatened vertebrate marine species using a multi-model approach. There has also been a recent surge of interest in climate change impacts on protected areas. This study applies three species distribution models and two sets of climate model projections to explore the potential impacts of climate change on marine species by 2050. A set of species in the North Sea, including seven threatened and ten major commercial species were used as a case study. Changes in habitat suitability in selected candidate protected areas around the UK under future climatic scenarios were assessed for these species. Moreover, change in the degree of overlap between commercial and threatened species ranges was calculated as a proxy of the potential threat posed by overfishing through bycatch. The ensemble projections suggest northward shifts in species at an average rate of 27 km per decade, resulting in small average changes in range overlap between threatened and commercially exploited species. Furthermore, the adverse consequences of climate change on the habitat suitability of protected areas were projected to be small. Although the models show large variation in the predicted consequences of climate change, the multi-model approach helps identify the potential risk of increased exposure to human stressors of critically endangered species such as common skate (<i>Dipturus batis</i>) and angelshark (<i>Squatina squatina</i>).","Jones, M.C.; Dye, S.R.; Fernandes, J.A.; Frölicher, T.L.; Pinnegar, J.K.; Warren, R.; Cheung, W.W.L.",WOS:000314019100051,"Cheung, William, W.W.L.","Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Changing Ocean Res Unit, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054216,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, to date, few studies have evaluated such diversity throughout the known distribution of a putative deep-sea species.

Trophic specialization is a main force driving species evolution and is responsible for classical examples of adaptive radiations in fishes. We investigate the effect of trophic specialization on the rate of environmental niche evolution in the damselfish, Pomacentridae, which is an important family of tropical reef fishes. First, phylogenetic niche conservatism is not detected in the family using a standard test of phylogenetic signal, and we demonstrate that the environmental niches of damselfishes that differ in trophic specialization are not equivalent while they still overlap at their mean values. Second, we estimate the relative rates of niche evolution on the phylogenetic tree and show the heterogeneity among rates of environmental niche evolution of the three trophic groups. We suggest that behavioural characteristics related to trophic specialization can constrain the evolution of the environmental niche and lead to conserved niches in specialist lineages. Our results show the extent of influence of several traits on the evolution of the environmental niche and shed new light on the evolution of damselfishes, which is a key lineage in current efforts to conserve biodiversity in coral reefs.","Litsios, G.; Pellissier, L.; Forest, F.; Lexer, C.; Pearman, P.B.; Zimmermann, N.E.; Salamin, N.",WOS:000307780400005,"Litsios, Glenn, G.","Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.1140,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,trophic specialization; environmental niche; phylogenetic nicheconservatism; evolutionary rate heterogeneity; evolutionary model,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially pertinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predictions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a 'best' model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised.","Jones, M.C.; Dye, S.R.; Pinnegar, J.K.; Warren, R.; Cheung, W.W.L.",WOS:000299984800013,"Jones, Miranda, M.C.","Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci CEFAS, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.11.003,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Species distribution modelling; North Sea; Range maps; Marine fishes;Model comparison,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We found 1443 records for 317 species. The Bryozoa were the most prevalent phylum in terms of numbers of records and species, but 2 invasive ascidians were the most frequently reported species. Among all species, 9.1% of the fauna have been reported to be invasive. Most species were represented by only 1 to 3 records, suggesting that this fauna has been underrepresented in the literature. The number of species estimated per state peaked in Florida, North Carolina, and Massachusetts, where provincial faunas overlap. Although Cape Cod in Massachusetts and Cape Hatteras in North Carolina represent putative faunal boundaries along the east coast, 63% of the fouling organisms have distributional limits which extend well beyond one or both of these capes. A large proportion of this fauna is widely distributed from New England to the South Atlantic Bight, yet 22 northern species and 96 southern species have restricted distributions. Analysis of community-level studies also revealed regional differences, especially between New England and southern states. These patterns are indicative of latitudinal variation and the transitional nature of this fauna.

We hypothesized that there would be differences in community structure between the Antarctic, which is most affected by ice, and the sub-Antarctic and other neighbouring regions. We also hypothesized that rafting and West Wind Drift will be the significant drivers of biogeographical patterns. Additionally, the size, age, isolation, volcanic or glacial history of a region and the presence of large, beach dwelling, mammals and birds would all play a role in determining the level of biodiversity observed. Location: South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Southern Ocean. Methods: We examined all available intertidal records from the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic with additional data from neighbouring regions for comparison and context. We compiled 3902 occurrences of 1416 species of high southern latitude intertidal organisms from 229 locations and used PRIMER 6 to perform multivariate statistical analyses. Results: The Antarctic and sub-Antarctic are shown to be distinct biogeographical regions, with patterns driven by a small number of widely distributed species. These wide-ranging molluscs and macroalgae dominate the biogeographical structure of the Southern Ocean intertidal, most likely as a result of rafting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. East Antarctic intertidal habitats are potentially isolated by the Ross and Weddell Sea ice shelves but represent a great unknown in this biogeographical scheme. Main Conclusions: The view that the Antarctic intertidal is a lifeless desert does not hold true, with Antarctic Peninsula intertidal communities being richer and more diverse than those in southern South America and the sub-Antarctic islands. Changing conditions in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic intertidal mean that a representative baseline is needed (acquired through standardized and quantitative sampling) to assess future changes and to detect any invasive species.","Griffiths, H.J.; Waller, C.L.",WOS:000378711000007,"Griffiths, Huw James, H.J.","British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.12708,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Southern Ocean,Mollusca,"Climate change, ""Rafting""",NULL,Island biogeography; Macroalgae; Mollusc; Richness; Southern Ocean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

More optimistically, nearly 97%of name combinations could be resolved to a currently valid name, suggesting that computer-aided approaches may provide feasible means to improve digitized content. Finally, we associated names back to biocollections records and fit logistic models to test potential drivers of issues.

The database fulfills NOAA’s requirements under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) to identify and map locations of deep-sea corals and to submit this information for use by regional fishery management councils. At present, there is no comprehensive, national-scale data portal for deep-sea corals and sponges. Given the authorities outlined in the MSA, NOAA’s DSCRTP will serve as a central data aggregator and distributor. The DSCRTP will aggregate and make accessible historical records from samples archived in museums, research institutions, and reported in the scientific literature augmented by observations collected during deep-water in situ surveys conducted by NOAA and other research institutions. The database schema accommodates both linear (trawls, transects) and point data (samples, observations). The schema captures information in 95 fields across eight main categories related to surveys (e.g. cruises or expeditions), events (e.g. dives or transects), observations (e.g. specimens or images), as well as taxonomic identification, environment, occurrence details, metadata and record-keeping information. Not all fields are required for submission to the database. The minimal data requirements for point observations, transects, and trawls are outlined in this document. The database represents a new standard to catalyze progress in deep-sea coral and sponge resource management and habitat suitability modeling.

We compared total abundance and richness of invertebrates transported on hulls versus those in ballast water. We found that hull fouling was associated with higher total abundance and richness of nonindigenous species when compared with ballast water. Additionally, a significant positive richness–total abundance relationship for nonindigenous species for hull fouling but not for ballast water assemblages suggests that the likelihood of a high-risk (i.e., species-rich and high abundance) introduction event is greater for the former than the latter vector. The discovery of viable, widespread nonindigenous barnacles in hull samples further underscores the prominence of hull fouling over ballast water as a vector of nonindigenous species. Our study demonstrates that hull fouling is a more important vector for transfer of nonindigenous species to the Canadian Arctic than ballast water based on abundance and richness of nonindigenous species transported by the two vectors.

One well-known bias from terrestrial studies is that wide-ranging species tend to be described earlier. To test this hypothesis for the deep sea, spatial data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) were combined with taxonomic data from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) to carry out a meta-analysis on all species records found below 300 m.

Sawfishes were mainly recorded in the western Mediterranean, in areas close to large rivers with light human impact. Most of the documented individuals were juveniles, suggesting local parturition. Extinction analyses yielded variable results and were affected by the sparseness of records but suggested that both species went extinct in the Mediterranean Sea in the 1960s–1970s.

The Parazoanthidae-sponge associations are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters from the intertidal to the deep sea in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. However, the taxonomic identification of both parties is often confused due to variable morphology and wide ecological ranges. In particular, Parazoanthidae species diversity remains poorly understood in the Indo-Pacific. In the present study, the diversity of the sponge-zoanthid association in the Indo-Pacific was investigated with 71 Parazoanthidae specimens collected from 29 different locations in Japan (<i>n</i> = 22), Australia (<i>n</i> = 6) and Florida, USA (<i>n</i> = 1). For all specimens morphological analyses were performed and total DNA was extracted and amplified for four DNA markers (COI-mtDNA, mt 16S-rDNA, ITS-rDNA and ALG11-nuDNA). The combined data demonstrate that the specimens of this study are clearly different from those of all described <i>Parazoanthus</i> species, and lead us to erect <i>Umimayanthus</i> gen. n., within family Parazoanthidae, containing the three newly described species <i>U</i>. <i>chanpuru</i> sp. n., <i>U. miyabi</i> sp. n<i>., U. nakama</i> sp. n. The new genus also includes the previously described species <i>U. parasiticus</i> (Duchassaing and Michelotti, 1860; comb. nov.), previously belonging to the genus <i>Parazoanthus</i>. Neighbor joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probability phylogenetic trees clearly demonstrate the monophyly of <i>Umimayanthus</i> gen. n. to the exclusion of all outgroup sequences. The phylogenetic results were also compared to morphological features, and polyp sizes, amount of sand content in tissues, types of connections between polyps, and cnidae data, in particular holotrichs-1, were useful in distinguishing the different species within this new genus. This new genus can be distinguished from all other Zoantharia by a unique and conserved 9 bp insertion and a 14 bp deletion in the mt 16S-rDNA region. Additionally, compared to <i>Parazoanthus</i> sensu stricto (i.e. <i>P. axinellae</i> [Schmidt, 1862]), <i>Umimayanthus</i> spp. are only found associated to sponges, and have a coenenchyme much less developed than <i>Parazoanthus</i> sensu stricto.

Previous studies have shown that the distribution of jellyfish blooms can display a marked consistency in space and time, suggesting that such patterns cannot be attributed to passive processes alone. In the present study, we used a combination of microsatellite markers and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences to investigate genetic structuring of the scyphozoan jellyfish <i>Rhizostoma octopus</i> in the Irish and Celtic Seas. The mitochondrial data indicated far higher levels of population differentiation than the microsatellites: F<sub>ST[MT]</sub><i> </i>= 0.300 vs. F<sub>ST[NUC]</sub><i> </i>= 0.013. Simulation studies indicated that the low levels of nuclear differentiation were not the result of limited power because of low levels of polymorphism. These findings, supported by palaeodistribution modelling and mismatch distribution analysis, are consistent with expansion of <i>R. octopus</i> from a single, limited refugium after the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by subsequent isolation, and that the discrepancy between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers is a result of the nuclear loci taking longer to reach mutation–drift equilibrium following the expansion as a result of their four-fold larger effective population size. The populations studied are probably not well connected via gene flow, and thus genetically as well as geographically distinct, although our findings also highlight the need to use a combination of organellar and nuclear markers to enable a more complete understanding of population demography and structure, particularly for species with large effective population sizes.","Glynn, F.; Houghton, J.D.R.; Provan, J.",WOS:000362729200009,"Glynn, Fergal, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/bij.12614,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    microsatellites;mitochondrial COI;palaeodistribution modelling,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Sediments of this area are dominated by silt. At the time of sampling, oxygen conditions on the shelf were poor (between 0.42 and 0.68 ml l<sup>- 1</sup>) but not hypoxic. Below 400 m, however, concentrations rose steadily up to 5.28 ml l<sup>- 1</sup>. Macrozoobenthic communities along this depth gradient are described, revealing among others the community structure for the continental margin area and the deep sea off northern Namibia for the first time. Cluster analysis revealed 5 different communities along the depth gradient with three shelf communities, one continental margin community and one deep-sea community. All in all, 314 different taxa were found with polychaetes being the most abundant group. Diversity index (Shannon) was lowest for the shallow water community with 2.21 and highest for the deep-sea community with 4.79, showing a clear trend with increasing water depth. Species richness, however, reached its maximum with 187 taxa along the continental margin between 400 and 1300 m water depth. Dominant species for each community are named with the two <i>Cumacea</i>, <i>Iphinoe</i><i>africana</i> and <i>Upselaspis caparti</i>, being characteristic for the shallow water community. On the shelf, we found surprisingly high biomass values (23–123 g m<sup>- 2</sup>), mainly caused by polychaetes, the bivalve <i>Sinupharus galatheae</i> and the gastropod <i>Nassarius vinctus</i>.

For this study, we used a presence/absence dataset which included information on 174 species (invertebrates and fishes) and 9 environmental variables. We first performed the modeling analyses and assessed beta diversity using the turnover component of the Jaccard’s dissimilarity index. We then performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling to map predicted beta diversity. To delineate the biogeographical regions, we used fuzzy cluster analysis. Finally, we also identified a set of indicator species which characterized the species assemblages in each identified biogeographical region.

In order to answer to our questions, the biodiversity and functional diversity of meiofauna and macrofauna were analysed, with a focus on three target groups: meiobenthic nematodes, macrobenthic nematodes and polychaetes. Meiobenthic nematodes and macrofaunal diversity appeared to be related only in terms of turnover diversity. A cross-taxon analysis on macrobenthic nematode and polychaete diversity and meiofauna diversity revealed a positive relationship in all cases that were studied. Considering functional diversity, many relationships emerged between the two benthic components. A higher meiobenthic nematode diversity did not enhance a higher functional diversity. A higher macrofauna diversity enhanced a higher functional diversity, but not for all macrobenthic taxa (i.e., nematodes).

This paper reviews the advances in the study of meiofauna with regard to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Four taxonomic groups are valuable for predicting global changes: foraminifers (especially calcareous forms), nematodes, copepods and ostracods. Environmental variables are fundamental in the interpretation of meiofaunal patterns and multistressor experiments are more informative than single stressor ones, revealing complex ecological and biological interactions. Global change has a general negative effect on meiofauna, with important consequences on benthic food webs.

On the basis of the available foraminiferal literature on the Aegean Sea coupled with our data from Saros Bay, a very high number of foraminiferal species is estimated to occur in this basin. A total of 799 species belonging to 276 genera, 93 families and 43 superfamilies have been recorded in the Aegean Sea. These values are remarkably higher than those documented in previous foraminiferal studies carried out in different parts of the Mediterranean Sea. Although the determination of the total foraminiferal diversity in the Mediterranean Sea remains a difficult task, we speculate that this number may be in excess of 1,000.","Frontalini, F.; Kaminski, M.A.; Mikellidou, I.; du Châtelet, E.A.",WOS:000361755600015,"Kaminski, Michael, M.A.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-014-0238-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Aegean,Foraminifera,NULL,NULL,Benthic foraminifera; Checklist; Saros Bay,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Latitudinal diversity of sea anemones (Cnidaria: Actiniaria). <i>Biol. Bull. 224(2)</i>: 89-98","We sought to determine if the global distribution of sea anemones (cnidarian order Actiniaria) conforms to the classic pattern of biogeography-taxon richness at the equator with attenuation toward the poles-a pattern that is derived almost entirely from data on terrestrial plants and animals. We plotted the empirical distribution of species occurrences in 10 degrees bands of latitude based on published information, then, using the Chao2 statistic, inferred the completeness of that inventory. We found the greatest species richness of sea anemones at 30-40 ° N and S, with lower numbers at tropical latitudes and the fewest species in polar areas. The Chao2 statistic allowed us to infer that the richness pattern we found is not due to particularly poor knowledge of tropical sea anemones. No 10 degrees band of latitude has less than 60% of the theoretical number of species known, but for only about half of them could we reject the null hypothesis (P = 0.05) that information is complete; anemone diversity is best documented at high latitudes. We infer that the 1089 valid species currently known constitute about 70% of the theoretical total of about 1500 species of Actiniaria. The distribution pattern of sea anemone species resembles that of planktonic foraminiferans and benthic marine algae, although planktonic bacteria, marine bivalves, and shallow and deep scleractinian corals show the terrestrial pattern of equatorial richness attenuating with latitude. Sea anemone species richness is complementary to that of scleractinian corals at many scales; our findings affirm it at the global scale.","Fautin, D.G.; Malarky, L.; Soberón, J.",WOS:000319492100004,"Malarky, Lacey, L.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

A total of 65 names were found in the literature. Of these, 48 are considered valid, 16 synonyms, and one nomen dubium. In addition, characteristics that distinguish each genus currently in use for TWA shallow water species have indicated the need for reassignment (new combinations within Drilliidae) of 15 species.

They are an important constituent of the deep-sea megafauna that are sometimes found in sufficient abundance to act as a significant source of habitat structure for meiofaunal and macrofaunal organisms. This study utilised maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) and a high-resolution environmental database to explore the environmental factors controlling the presence of Xenophyophorea and two frequently sampled xenophyophore species that are taxonomically stable: <i>Syringammina fragilissima</i> and <i>Stannophyllum zonarium</i>. These factors were also used to predict the global distribution of each taxon. Areas of high habitat suitability for xenophyophores were highlighted throughout the world?s oceans, including in a large number of areas yet to be suitably sampled, but the Northeast and Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, the Red Sea and deep-water regions of the Malay Archipelago represented particular hotspots. The two species investigated showed more specific habitat requirements when compared to the model encompassing all xenophyophore records, perhaps in part due to the smaller number and relatively more clustered nature of the presence records available for modelling at present. The environmental variables depth, oxygen parameters, nitrate concentration, carbon-chemistry parameters and temperature were of greatest importance in determining xenophyophore distributions, but, somewhat surprisingly, hydrodynamic parameters were consistently shown to have low importance, possibly due to the paucity of well-resolved global hydrodynamic datasets. The results of this study (and others of a similar type) have the potential to guide further sample collection, environmental policy, and spatial planning of marine protected areas and industrial activities that impact the seafloor, particularly those that overlap with aggregations of these conspicuously large single-celled eukaryotes.","Ashford, O.S.; Davies, A.J.; Jones, D.O.B.",WOS:000345820100003,"Ashford, Oliver, O.S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2014.07.012,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Maxent; Species distribution modelling; Xenophyophorea; Syringammina fragilissima; Stannophyllum zonarium,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Also, the relative importance of different drivers of species distributions are compared through species distribution modelling.Location The South African beaches are among the best-studied in the world, providing sufficient biological data for the analyses. There is also a well-established coastal protected-area network that putatively provides moderate protection to nearly all beach habitats.Methods Species distribution maps of beach-dependent vertebrates, macrofauna, microflora, and foredune vegetation were compiled from existing sources or modelled using standard techniques. While some data were available for the latter analyses, additional sampling was required to improve bioregional coverage. Each species' distribution was coded to a detailed map of the South African shoreline. Representation of habitats and species in various configurations of existing reserves was determined.Results Overall, 535 species have been recorded on the South African sandy shores, including 139 common species. Endemism is variable among taxonomic groups. Notably, two-thirds of the macrofauna are regional endemics, half of which are endemic to South Africa. For almost all of the common species, < 20 % of their distributions are protected in land-sea reserves. Protection of beach habitats is similarly poor; conservation targets were not met in all cases, and most habitat types are considered poorly protected.Main conclusions Sandy beach communities are considerably more diverse than they are generally acknowledged to be, and comprise a unique suite of biota. Given the species' narrow distributions and high degree of exposure to threats, many probably qualify as threatened/endangered. In spite of this, beaches are poorly represented in coastal reserve networks. To redress this issue, conservation planners need to account for beaches specifically, and to ensure they are represented in contiguous land-sea protected areas.","Harris, L.; Campbell, E.E.; Nel, R.; Schoeman, D.",WOS:000343865300002,"Harris, Linda, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12226,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Biodiversity;MaxEnt;protected areas;sandy beaches;spatial prioritization;species distribution models,Journal article,NULL,NULL

BEMs were first built at a global extent to account for the full range of climatic conditions encountered by a given species. Habitat models were then built using fine-grained habitat variables at the scale of the Gulf of Gabes. We also used this hierarchical filtering approach to project the future distribution of these species under both climate change (the A2 scenario implemented with the Mediterranean climatic model NEMOMED8) and habitat loss (the loss of <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows) scenarios.ResultsThe hierarchical filtering approach predicted current species geographical ranges to be on average 56% smaller than those predicted using the BEMs alone. This pattern was also observed under the climate change scenario. Combining the habitat loss and climate change scenarios indicated that the magnitude of range shifts due to climate change was larger than from the loss of <i>P. oceanica</i> meadows.Main conclusionsOur findings emphasize that BEMs may overestimate current and future ranges of marine species if species–habitat relationships are not also considered. A hierarchical filtering approach that accounts for fine-grained habitat variables limits the uncertainty associated with model-based recommendations, thus ensuring their outputs remain applicable within the context of marine resource management.","Hattab, T.; Albouy, C.; Lasram, F.B.R.; Somot, S.; Le Loc'h, F.; Leprieur, F.",WOS:000344591900009,"Hattab, Tarek, T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12217,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Climate change;exploited species;habitat loss;hierarchical filtering;Mediterranean Sea;spatial scale;species distribution modelling,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Dalhousie University: Halifax. xvii, 135 + appendices pp.","Commercial harvest of fish stocks and their appropriate management requires an understanding of their population dynamics and of their ability to sustain exploitation. Here, some ecological and evolutionary consequences of excessive exploitation are examined. In Chapter 2 I evaluate the knowledge base and status of commercially exploited marine populations that undergo formal stock assessment. Despite a bias towards industrialised countries and stocks of commercial importance, I show the pervasiveness of overexploitation and, by using reference points of stock status, identify important regional differences in the effectiveness of fisheries management. In Chapter 3 I develop a data format suitable for ecological analyses to best disseminate the valuable information contained in scientific trawl surveys. This data format is suitable for inclusion into the public Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and provides detailed observations that are suitable to the reconstruction of important fisheries-independent stock indices. In Chapter 4 I examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of groundfish populations. A positive abundance-occupancy relationship was estimated for the majority of groundfish populations examined suggesting that this well-described terrestrial pattern is also pervasive in the marine environment. Spatial hysteresis was exhibited by numerous populations, indicating that the spatial distribution of individuals failed to recover despite recoveries in abundance. In Chapter 5 I estimate the demographic consequences of changes in growth and maturation characteristics. The ability of a population to sustain harvest, and its ability to recover from previous depletions can be overestimated because of trends towards earlier maturation and slower growth. In Chapter 6 I conclude the thesis by discussing the implications of my research to fisheries science and management.","Ricard, D.",NULL,"Ricard, Daniel, D.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

Despite their worldwide occurrence with over 50 species known today, their fossil record is unknown. We provide the first unambiguous evidence of cryptochirids in the fossil record through their crescentic pits, typical for certain cryptochirids, in Western Atlantic fossil corals, while the Eocene genus Montemagrechirus is excluded from the Cryptochiridae and referred to Montemagrechiridae fam. nov. Nine Pleistocene corals with crescentic pits originate from Florida (USA), and single specimens with pits come from the late Pleistocene of Cuba and the late Pliocene of Florida, all of which are measured for growth analyses. These pits represent trace fossils named Galacticus duerri igen. nov., isp. nov. A study of modern cryptochirid domicile shape (crescentic pit, circular-oval pit, or a true gall) shows that species within crab genera tend to inhabit the same pit shape. Crescentic pits in corals occur not only in the Western Atlantic today, but also in the Indo-West Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific. Thus, examination of Cenozoic fossil coral collections from these regions should yield further examples of cryptochirid pits, which would help to constrain the antiquity of this cryptic crab family.","Klompmaker, A.A.; Portell, R.W.; van der Meij, S.E.T.",WOS:000372696100001,"Klompmaker, Adiël, A.A.","Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, 1659 Museum Rd,POB 117800, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep23443,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Cryptochiridae,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

They are considered to be particularly important in nutrient-rich coastal ecosystems and at high latitudes, but considerably less so in the oligotrophic open ocean. The <em>Tara</em> Oceans circumnavigation collected samples from a wide range of oceanic regions using a standardized sampling procedure. Her a total of ~12 million diatom V9-18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ribotypes, derived from 293 size-fractionated plankton communities  collected at 46 sampling sites across the global ocean euphotic zone, have been analyzed to explore diatom global diversity and community composition. We provide a new estimate of diversity of marine planktonic diatoms at 4,748 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Based on the total assigned ribotypes, <em>Chaetoceros</em> was the most abundant and diverse genus, followed by <em>Fragilariopsis, Thalassiosira</em>, and <em>Corethron</em>. We found only a few cosmopolitan ribotypes displaying an even distribution across stations and high abundance, many of which could not be assigned with confidence to any known genus. Three distinct communities from South Pacific, Mediterranean, and  Southern Ocean waters were identified that share a substantial percentage of ribotypes within them. Sudden drops in diversity  were observed at Cape Agulhas, which separates the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and across the Drake Passage between the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, indicating the importance of these ocean circulation choke points in constraining diatom distributi and diversity. We also observed high diatom diversity in the open ocean, suggesting that diatoms may be more relevant in these oceanic systems than generally considered.","Malviya, S.; Scalco, E.; Audic, S.; Vincent, F.; Veluchamy, A.; Poulain, J.; Wincker, P.; Iudicone, D.; de Vargas, C.; Bittner, L.; Zingone, A.; Bowler, C.",WOS:000394340000001,"Iudicone, Daniele, D.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.1509523113,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Diatoms""",NULL,Metabarcoding; Tara Oceans; Choke points,Journal article,NULL,NULL
