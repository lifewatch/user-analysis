Population dynamics and dissimilarities of biological nature (the differences in turnover rate and seasonal alterations in standing stock) can cause significant divergences between the L and D foraminiferal assemblages. This study compares L and D foraminifera to evaluate the sediment quality of the Brazilian Saquarema Lagoon System (SLS) using biogeochemical proxies and predict how coastal ecosystems are responding to the combined effects of eutrophication and pollution pressure and areas where the paleoenvironmental studies can be performed. The SLS is a transitional environment where total organic carbon, proteins, and dissolved oxygen are the main factors controlling the distribution of foraminiferal assemblage. The high values of biopolymers (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) in SLS indicate a very impacted environment with long water residence time. The low values of species richness, Shannon-Weaver diversity, and evenness for both L and D foraminiferal assemblages are a consequence of fluctuating conditions in the SLS. Due to low salinities, agglutinated species and Quinqueloculina seminula can occur in the most confined areas, and <i>Ammonia parkinsoniana, Cribroelphidium excavatum, Cribroelphidium poeyanum</i>, and <i>Elphidium gunteri</i> characterized the area with the highest marine influence. Although in most of the SLS the taphonomic processes modified the original assemblage, in some regions the thanatocoenosis corresponds to the biocenosis. These areas can be considered the most suitable for future paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic studies.","Belart, P.; Clemente, I.; Raposo, D.; Habib, R.; Volino, E.; Villar, A.; Alves Martins, M.V.; Fontana, L.; Lorini, M.L.; Panigai, G.; Frontalini, F.; Figueiredo, M.S.L.; Vasconcelos, S.C.; Laut, L.",WOS:000450519500018,"Frontalini, Fabrizio, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3856/vol46-issue5-fulltext-18,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Environmental quality, ""Foraminifera"", ""Marine pollution""",NULL,trophic state; Coastal lagoon; neontology,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The absence of species‐specific information on catch, life history and migration of skates has often precluded the development of single‐species stock assessments and led to the use of cursory multispecies assessments, which lack the ability to track species‐specific catch and abundance trends. This has resulted in undetected local extirpations, as has been previously reported for common (<i>Dipturus batis</i>, Rajidae), white (<i>Rostroraja alba</i>, Rajidae) and long‐nose (<i>Dipturus oxyrhinchus</i>, Rajidae) skates in the Irish Sea. Here, we (a) use case studies to illustrate how the perception of skate population structure and stock status has historically been masked through multispecies assessment and management practices, (b) review current information on the movement of skates and identify gaps in knowledge, and (c) identify biases associated with the use of various tagging technologies, which have confounded our understanding of movement and migration ecology of skates. Considering that over 40% of extant Rajidae species are listed as “Data Deficient” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, we illustrate a critical need to broaden the current understanding of skate life history, movement and migration ecology by providing recommendations on the further application of electronic tags and biogeochemical natural tags in movement studies and highlight the benefits that studies using these approaches have for novel management frameworks.","Siskey, M.R.; Shipley, O.N.; Frisk, M.G.",WOS:000459829100007,"Frisk, Michael, M.G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/faf.12340,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,Rajidae,"Conservation, ""Movement"", ""Tagging""",NULL,migration ecology; multispecies assessment; skates,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences were used in Bayesian and Maximum likelihood analyses to generate a phylogenetic hypothesis for Apogon species. Bayesian inferences were used to date the cladogenetic events. Analyses with BioGeoBEARS were conducted to reconstruct the biogeographic history and ancestral ranges. The phylogenetic results show a monophyletic clade of TEP Apogon species with A. imberbis from the eastern Atlantic as sister species. The two lineages diverged during the Miocene. Within the TEP clade, two subclades diverged at around 11.1 million years ago (<i>Mya</i>): one clusters the coastal continental species (<i>A. pacificus, A. retrosella</i> and <i>A. dovii</i>), and the second clusters the oceanic island species (<i>A. atradorsatus, A. atricaudus and A. guadalupensis</i>). The estimated diversification times of these subclades were 9.8 and 7.1 <i>Mya</i>, respectively. Within each subclade, species divergences occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs. The divergent event between the Atlantic <i>A. imberbis</i> and <i>Apogon</i> TEP clade corresponds to the first closure event of the Central American Seaway. The biogeographic history of Apogon within the TEP appears to be the result of vicariant, dispersal and founder events that occurred during the last 11 million years. The vicariant and dispersal events occurred along the mainland and were associated with the origin of the Central American Gap. The founder events could have allowed the invasion of Apogon to TEP island areas and could have been driven by ancient warming oceanic waters, changes in circulation of marine currents, and the presence of seamounts in ancient marine ridges that allowed the settlement of marine biota. These factors may have allowed <i>Apogon</i> lineages to cross the TEP biogeographic barriers at different times, with subsequent genetic isolation.","Piñeros, V.J.; Beltrán-López, R.G.; Baldwin, C.C.; Barraza, E.J.; Espinoza, E.; Martínez, J.E.; Domínguez-Domínguez, O.",WOS:000456566000018,"Piñeros, Victor Julio, V.J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.12.010,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,Pisces,NULL,NULL,Biogeographic provinces; cryptic fishes; diversification processes; historical biogeography; reef fishes; tropical eastern Pacific Ocean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Silty clay and clayey silt communities appeared quite similar, being mainly represented by opportunistic species typical of the Adriatic coastal area. Benthic populations found at the offshore relict sand were characterized by a higher percentage of sensitive species. Independently of sediment typology, pipelines' installation seems to not affect the benthic populations that appear more influenced by environmental features.","Spagnolo, A.; Cuicchi, C.; De Biasi, A.M.; Ferra, C.; Montagnini, L.",WOS:000457512500062,"Montagnini, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Impact, ""Marine environment"", ""Pipelines""",NULL,Benthic invertebrates; Adriatic Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To date, the potential environmental consequences of mining operations in the remote deep sea are poorly known. Experimental studies are scarce, especially with regard to the effect of sediment and nodule debris depositions as a consequence of seabed mining. To elucidate the potential effects of the deposition of crushed polymetallic nodule particles on abyssal meiobenthos communities, a short (11 days) in situ experiment at the Peru Basin in the South East Pacific Ocean was conducted. We covered abyssal, soft sediment with approx. 2cm of crushed nodule particles and sampled the sediment after eleven days of incubation at 4200m water depth. Short-term ecological effects on the meiobenthos community were studied including changes in their composition and vertical distribution in the sediment as well as nematode genus composition. Additionally, copper burden in a few similar-sized, but randomly selected nematodes was measured by means of µ-X-ray fluorescence. At the end of the experiment, 46±1% of the total meiobenthos occurred in the added crushed nodule layer while abundances decreased in the underlying 2cm compared to the same depth-interval in original, undisturbed sediments. Densities and community composition in the deeper 2–5cm layers remained similar in covered and undisturbed sediments. The migratory response into the added substrate was particularly seen in polychaetes (73±14%, relative abundance across all depth layers) copepods (71±6%), nauplii (61±9%) and nematodes (43±1%). While the dominant nematode genera in the added substrate did not differ from those in underlying layers or the undisturbed sediments, feeding type proportions in this layer were altered with a 9% decrease of non-selective deposit feeders and an 8% increase in epistrate feeders. Nematode tissue copper burden did not show elevated copper toxicity resulting from burial with crushed nodule particles. The results indicate that short-term substrate burial requires special attention with regard to ecological consequences of mineral extraction in the deep-sea.","Mevenkamp, L.; Guilini, K.; Boetius, A.; De Grave, J.; Laforce, B.; Vandenberghe, D.; Vincze, L.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000470822900001,"Mevenkamp, Lisa, L.","Department of Biology, Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2329-2019,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, the distribution of benthic and demersal megafauna within the thalweg of some of these canyons (i.e. the Gioia-Petrace and Caulonia Marina canyons in the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Calabrian margins, respectively, and the Sant’Agata, San Gregorio, Tremestieri and Messina canyons in the Messina Strait) was studied using Remotely Operated Vehicle video transects. The relationships between fauna distribution and environmental conditions (i.e. seafloor type, depth, slope, aspect and canyon system) extracted from video footage and bathymetric data were assessed to identify the main physical drivers influencing the megafaunal assemblages within active submarine canyons. These latter have their heads in shallow water, so representing highly dynamic environments affected by present-day sediment transport. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis allowed to distinguish seven different assemblages occurring in the study areas. PERMANOVA analysis showed significant differences among species groups associated to different seafloor types, depth ranges and canyon systems. Distance-based linear modeling (DistLM) identified the canyon system as the main factor explaining the variability of the megafaunal assemblages across the study areas. In the Gioia and Petrace canyons, both characterized by homogenous fine-grained sediment, the assemblages were mainly dominated by Polychaeta Sabellidae and Ceriantharia. The almost total absence of sessile fauna at the canyons’ head was interpreted as an effect of a strong physical disturbance due to the impact of sedimentary flows. In the canyons of the Messina Strait, the presence of more varied seafloor encompassing fine and coarse sediment along with an higher spatial heterogeneity of physical disturbance, determined more diversified faunal assemblages, featuring species associated with hard and soft substrates. More in detail, in the Sant’Agata, San Gregorio and Messina canyons the colonization of cobbles and boulders by slow-growing species vulnerable to physical disturbance such as the gorgonians Acanthogorgia hirsuta and Swiftia dubia was recorded. For the Tremestieri canyons a stronger impact by sedimentary flows was reflected both by a very high abundance of land-based litter and the lowest values of species richness. Interactions between megafauna and marine litter, whose widespread occurrence was recorded on the floor of all these canyons, have been also presented and discussed. Although in several cases litter caused entanglement of benthic species, the anthropogenic debris was also used as growing substrate or shelter by some invertebrates and fishes, suggesting complex fauna-litter interactions that should be better explored. Overall, the large variability in morphology and seafloor characteristics across the studied canyons is reflected on the variability of megafauna assemblages, suggesting a strong influence of the physical conditions specific of each canyon in controlling fauna distribution.","Pierdomenico, M.; Cardone, F.; Carluccio, A.; Casalbore, D.; Chiocci, F.L.; Maiorano, P.; D'Onghia, G.",WOS:000457950800004,"Pierdomenico, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.015,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Submarine canyons,NULL,Megafauna-habitat relationships; Mediterranean Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Submarine canyons, a pervasive feature of the continental margins worldwide, increase habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that different topographic structures or/and food sources controlling the abundance, biomass and biodiversity (using meiofauna and nematodes as a model study) in canyon systems. To do so, we compared different topographic structures: canyon edge, thalweg and axis, and the upper shelf and open slope in the Gulf of Gioia (Gioia and Petrace Canyons) and in the Gulf of Naples (Dohrn Canyon) (Tyrrhenian Sea) at different depths. Our results suggest that meiofaunal abundance and biomass are generally higher in the canyon thalwegs than in the canyon edge or adjacent open slopes at regional scale. This pattern is not always confirmed for biodiversity and when thalwegs are compared to different topographic structures within the Gioia Canyon system. In our study, the role of food quantity and quality is preeminent to explain the spatial distribution of meiofaunal variables among different topographic structures at 200-m while habitat heterogeneity become relevant at 500-m and within the Dohrn Canyon. In Gioia and Petrace Canyons we observed a high food availability is associated to specific topographic structures (thalwegs) that influenced the meiofaunal abundance and diversity distribution and nematode diversity and species composition. Each topographic structure shows a high number of exclusive species that contributes to a high species turnover and high overall biodiversity in all canyon systems. Changes in nematode composition determine also differences in the functional diversity (trophic guilds composition) and life strategy of the nematode assemblages.

Hydrological conditions for most of the Barents Sea are very close to optimum for the snow crab, there are large areas of suitable habitat and abundant sources of food. Therefore, better understanding of trophic interactions between the snow crab and native benthic fauna is important to assess any potential impacts on the ecosystem and to enable the rational management of fisheries resources in the eastern Barents Sea. This paper investigates the snow crab diet and its feeding intensity in the Barents Sea. Data shows that the snow crab has very wide ration that includes almost all kinds of benthic invertebrates in the Barents Sea. There is a difference in the diet of females and males, juveniles and adults. Juveniles and females prefer shallow areas with communities of bivalve mollusks, males live deeper on slopes and depressions where polychaetes and crustaceans are the most abundant group. Stomach contents are analyzed to determine the species composition and the frequency of occurrence for various benthic taxa. Consumption of food was estimated and compared with data from the Russian seas of Pacific region. Total annual grazing of macrozoobenthos by the snow crab is calculated for its current distribution in the Barents Sea. Snow crab consumes at least 30 thousand tons of benthos annually, which amounts to 0.1–0.2% of the total macrozoobenthos biomass of the investigated area. Population of the snow crab provides the largest impact on the benthic communities in the north-eastern part of the Barents Sea and near the south side of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.","Zakharov, D.V.; Manushin, I.E.; Strelkova, N.A.; Pavlov, V.A.; Nosova, T.B.",NULL,"Zakharov, D.V.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Chionoecetes opilio,"Communities, ""Consumption"", ""Distribution"", ""Feeding"", ""Species composition""",NULL,crab Chionoecetes opilio; Barents Sea; macrozoobenthos; invasion.,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this work, we present a method for integrating a diversity of feeding habits data from published studies to evaluate the impact on indices that describe characteristics of individual taxa and their connectivity. We focus our study on feeding habits of the fishes of the northern Gulf of Mexico and seek to understand the importance of the forage fish Gulf Menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) in predator diets. We created a database of diet studies from the northern Gulf of Mexico that included six diet metrics: frequency of occurrence, wet weight, dry weight, number, volume, index of relative importance, and index of caloric importance. We then used this information to construct a set of traditional networks (all prey and predators were from a single taxonomic level and trophic connections were parameterized with a single diet metric). We also constructed a “robust” network where all taxa were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and trophic connections were parameterized using a resampling approach that included all available information. Linear regression and resampling methods were used to convert data reported in other diet metrics into the frequency of occurrence diet metric. For both traditional and robust networks, we used network indices to describe topological properties. With the robust network, we conducted removal simulations where the forage fish species Gulf Menhaden, and associated Clupeidae representatives, were removed from the network and the feeding effort of the predators was reallocated among their other prey items. We found that network and node-specific indices were sensitive to the choice of taxonomy and diet metric level. In the robust network, predator species with the greatest number of identified prey had the lowest precision in their connections and prey from the Arthropoda phyla had the lowest precision for connections. From the removal and reallocation simulations, we found that Actinopterygii and Arthropoda were the most impacted prey taxa with 1.2% to 4.3% increase in predation and approximately 23 taxa would receive 50% of the reallocated predation. Overall, the resampling methods we present provide a potential means for combining disparate diet data and enables a comprehensive understanding of trophic interactions within an ecosystem.","Leaf, R.T.; Oshima, M.C.",WOS:000461401800002,"Leaf, Robert, R.T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.12.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Aggregation, ""Forage fish""",NULL,Weighted network; Trophic dynamics,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Mar. Biol. Ann. Rev. 56</i>: 237-310","As the ocean continues to take up carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), it is difcult to predict the future of marine ecosystems. Natural CO<sub>2</sub> vent sites, mainly of volcanic origin, that provide a pH gradient are useful as a proxy to investigate ecological effects of ocean acidication. The effects of decreased pH can be assessed at increasing levels of organisation, from the responses of individuals of a species up through populations and communities to whole ecosystems. As a natural laboratory, CO<sub>2</sub> vent sites incorporate a range of environmental factors, such as gradients of nutrients, currents and species interactions that cannot be replicated in the laboratory or mesocosms, with the caveat that some vent systems have confounding factors such as hydrogen sulphide and metals. The rst CO<sub>2</sub> vent sites to be investigated in an ocean acidication context were the vents at the Castello Aragonese on the island of Ischia, Italy. The gas released is primarily CO<sub>2</sub> with no evidence of toxic substances. They have been the focus of a wealth of studies, which are reviewed here and in context with research at other vent systems. Investigations of the species that occur along the pH gradients at Ischia show that, as the pH decreases, there is a reduction in calcifying species, reecting the trends seen at other vent systems and in laboratory studies. The species assemblages at the Castello vents living at near future (2100) ocean acidication conditions (mean pH 7.8), show the resilience of many species to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, including many calcifying species (e.g. sea urchins, serpulids, bryozoans, foraminifera and corals). These taxa show different physiological and ecological mechanisms for acclimatisation and adaptation to low pH. As the oceans continue to acidify to pH levels <7.8, species assemblages are likely to become dominated by eshy algae and smaller-bodied, generalist invertebrates. These observations suggest that ocean acidication will result in a simplication of marine food webs and trophic complexity.","Foo, S.A.; Byrne, M.; Ricevuto, E.; Gambi, M.C.",NULL,"Foo, Shawna Andrea, S.A.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Benthic soft-bottom communities and ecosystem functions on the Northeast Greenland shelf. MSc Thesis. University of Bremen, Department of Biology and Chemistry: Bremen.  88 pp.","Benthic communities regulate numerous ecosystem processes and rely almost exclusively on the sinking of organic matter from the pelagic. In association with climate change the Arctic sea ice is shrinking, glacial discharge is increasing and Arctic marine ecosystems are expected to become more Atlantic in character. For the last 20 years, these environmental changes were observed for the Northeast Greenland(NEG) shelf and might have altered benthic community structures and their function in this region. In September/October 2017, soft-bottom communities were sampled and oxygen consumption was measured ex situ over time at 13 stations on the NEG shelf. Sediment granulometry and porosity, pigment concentrations and porewater chemistry (DIC, nutrients, sulfate, chloride) were assessed to characterize the habitat.It was found that macrofauna communities did not separate among regions, while foraminifera communities (>500 mm) and polychaeta did distinguish the northern Westwind Trough from the southern Norske Trough and the 79N Glacier. Benthic pigment concentration was the most important predictor for the community structure. Total abundance and biomass of macrofauna, single cell abundances, porewater DIC and ammonia concentrations were highest in the Westwind Trough compared toall other regions, which suggests the highest benthic productivity in the Westwind Trough. Overall benthic pigment concentrations were up to sevenfold lower compared to the 1990s, accompanied by a fivefold lower total abundance of macrofauna. The present study confirms previous reports about a strong pelagic-benthic coupling on the NEG shelf which might have weakened since the 1990s, suggesting that this is a result of higher zooplankton grazing. Longer ice-free periods and higher inflow of warm Atlantic Water on the NEG shelf might have led to favourable conditions for zooplankton of Atlantic origin, increasing pelagic mineralization that would finally lead to a reduction in the amount of organic matter reaching the sea floor.","Bodur, Y.",NULL,"Bodur, Yasemin, Y.",NULL,NULL,NULL,Lifewatch acknowledged,NULL,NULL,"Nutrients, ""Polynya"", ""Sediment""",Infauna,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

Universiteit Gent - Faculteit Bio-ingenieurswetenschappen: Gent.  64 pp.","Biomonitoring is a way to determine the biodiversity and ecological status of an ecosystem. This is important in a world where species are lost at an alarming rate. Animal species can be identified during biomonitoring with various methods. One of these is metabarcoding which uses genetic markers isolated from a DNA extract from the biological community under study. These can then be sequenced with one of the many available platforms. Recently, the British company Oxford Nanopore Technologies has developed a revolutionary technology (MinION)has made sequencing much more accessible. In this research, it was investigated whether it is possible to use this MinION sequencer for metabarcoding of marine zooplankton communities. Each step of the protocol was optimised, after which it was applied to samples taken during a biomonitoring campaign on the North Sea. Different DNA extraction techniques are tested, after which PCR amplification and purification are optimized by selection of an optimal primer set, PCR master mix, inhibition prevention measures and purification protocols.The amplicons were then sequenced and subdivided into species using a reference database. Finally, a comparison was made with a ZooScan analysis in which species are determined based on their morphology. Theresults largely conform to ZooScan determinations and show no discrepancies from what was found in the literature. Although further research in data processing is required, it can be concluded that metabarcoding with MinION sequencing is a valuable innovation in the field of biomonitoring.","Willemse, S.",NULL,"Willemse, Stijn, S.","Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Gent Univesity",NULL,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

It is still largely unknown what causes and maintains these differences, and whether they have fitness implications. In this research project, the causes and consequences of foraging generalism versus foraging specialisation were studied in GPS-equipped Herring Gulls (Larus Argentatus) breeding along the Belgian coast. Foraging specialisation was quantified both in terms of resource specialisation and spatial specialisation, during three distinguished periods of the breeding season. Morphological traits or sex could not be assigned as predictors of foraging differences. While drivers of foraging specialisation thus remain unknown, it is suggested that levels of specialisation may rather be due to behavioural differences. Contrary to expectations, energy expenditure of spatial specialists was higher than that of spatial generalists during the chick rearing period. Spatial specialists traversed longer distances during the other two periods of the breeding season.

In the absence of such fitness implications, the co-existence of multiple foraging strategies may result in populations that are more resistant to environmental stochasticity.","van den Bosch, M.",NULL,"van den Bosch, Merijn, M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

However, this becomes increasingly difficult as taxonomic turnover increases the dissimilarity between ecosystems. Here we use a guild-based approach to compare the ecological similarity of Cretaceous cold-seep assemblages preserved in the Pierre Shale surrounding the Black Hills and modern cold-seep assemblages from five previously recognized biofacies. We modify modern assemblage data to include only those taxa with fossilizable hard parts greater than 5 mm in length to make these modern data sets more comparable to potential fossil analogues. We find that while the Black Hills assemblages are more similar in ecological guild composition to the modern thyasirid biofacies, subsets share similarities in ecological structure to the lucinid and mussel-bed biofacies. The fossil seep assemblages are also more similar to one another than are modern assemblages belonging to the same biofacies, despite greater geographic and temporal dissimilarity among the fossil samples. Furthermore, guild-level ordination analyses show a secondary faunal gradient that reflects community succession in the hard substrate–dominated modern assemblages and reveals a parallel faunal gradient in the soft sediment–dominated Cretaceous assemblages, consistent with a gradient in the influence of seep fluids on the faunas. Thus, while the Black Hills assemblages are quite homogeneous in their composition, they capture ecological variation similar to successional patterns in modern seep systems.","Laird, J.D.; Belanger, C.L.",WOS:000459788900009,"Laird, Joshua, J.D.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/pab.2018.41,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The total water flux is evaluated for each tidal cycle using the data on the water level in the lagoon and on the area of its water mirror. The main factor of the larvae exchange is the tidal water flow that reaches the rate of 4 knots both for ebb and tide currents. The meroplankton from the lagoon is transported by the ebb current rather far to the sea, and its reverse drift with the tide current back to the lagoon looks doubtful, so export of the meroplankton from the lagoon is detected, with certain seasonal dynamics. The export is the most intensive in early summer (July) because of earlier spawning in the lagoon, which water is warmed quicker on shallows. The exchange decreases in August, when the water temperature is the highest both in the lagoon and in the Aniva Bay and many species spawn actively in both areas.

However, to date, no studies have investigated the variations in the diversity of traits (FD) linked with the role of these fishes in the ecosystem. FD is usually considered more sensitive than species richness in detecting early changes in response to disturbances, and therefore could serve as an indicator of ecological resilience to environmental changes. Here, we aim to characterize FD in the Taiwanese reef fish fauna and to document its regional variations. Six traits were used to categorize the 1,484 reef fish species occurring in four environmentally contrasted regions around Taiwan. The number of unique trait combinations (FEs), their richness (FRic), their redundancy (FR), their over‐redundancy (FOR), and their vulnerability (FV) were compared among these regions. Overall, 416 FEs were identified. Their number decreased from south to north in step with regional species richness but FRic remained similar among regions. FR and FOR were higher to the south. At the local scale, variations in FEs and FRic are in concordance with the worldwide pattern of FD. High‐latitude, impoverished fish assemblages, offer a range of trait combinations similar to diversified tropical assemblages. Increasing diversity in the latter mainly contributes to raising FR and supports already over‐redundant entities. High vulnerability makes many combinations highly sensitive to species loss, and was higher at intermediate latitudes when using a fine resolution in trait categories. It suggests that the loss of FEs may first be characterized by an increase in their vulnerability, a pattern that could have been overlooked in previous global scale analyses. Overall, this study provides new insights into reef fish trait biogeography with potential ramifications for ecosystem functioning.","Denis, V.; Chen, J.-W.; Chen, Q.; Hsieh, Y.E.; Lin, Y.V.; Wang, C.-W.; Wang, H.-Y.; Sturaro, N.",WOS:000457622300043,"Sturaro, Nicolas, N.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.4771,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,functional diversity; high-latitude; ichthyofauna; Kuroshio; marginality; traits,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Antarctic marine biodiversity: adaptations, environments and responses to change. <i>Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Ann. Rev. 56</i>: 2-133","Animals living in the Southern Ocean have evolved in a singular environment. It shares many of its attributes with the high Arctic, namely low, stable temperatures, the pervading effect of ice in its many forms and extreme seasonality of light and phytobiont productivity. Antarctica is, however, the most isolated continent on Earth and is the only one that lacks a continental shelf connection with another continent. This isolation, along with the many millions of years that these conditions have existed, has produced a fauna that is both diverse, with around 17,000 marine invertebrate species living there, and has the highest proportions of endemic species of any continent. The reasons for this are discussed. The isolation, history and unusual environmental conditions have resulted in the fauna producing a range and scale of adaptations to low temperature and seasonality that are unique. The best known such adaptations include channichthyid icefish that lack haemoglobin and transport oxygen around their bodies only in solution, or the absence, in some species, of what was only 20 years ago termed the universal heat shock response. Other adaptations include large size in some groups, a tendency to produce larger eggs than species at lower latitudes and very long gametogenic cycles, with egg development (vitellogenesis) taking 18–24 months in some species. The rates at which some cellular and physiological processes are conducted appear adapted to, or at least partially compensated for, low temperature such as microtubule assembly in cells, whereas other processes such as locomotion and metabolic rate are not compensated, and whole-animal growth, embryonic development, and limb regeneration in echinoderms proceed at rates even slower than would be predicted by the normal rules governing the effect of temperature on biological processes. This review describes the current state of knowledge on the biodiversity of the Southern Ocean fauna and on the majority of known ecophysiological adaptations of coldblooded marine species to Antarctic conditions. It further evaluates the impacts these adaptations have on capacities to resist, or respond to change in the environment, where resistance to raised temperatures seems poor, whereas exposure to acidified conditions to end-century levels has comparatively little impact.

In several families it can be accompanied by small additional transversal or dorso-ventral muscles. In contrast to the variable musculature, the pygidial innervation is far more uniform and in general comprises two huge main longitudinal nerves, a terminal commissure between them, and paired circumpigidial nerves. The pygidial epithelium bears numerous receptor cell endings, suggesting that the pygidium may act as an important sensory organ. The obtained results are in accordance with the recent data and indicate that such muscular and nervous organization may be characteristic of the whole order Phyllodocida.","Starunov, V.V.",WOS:000459514600005,"Starunov, Viktor, V.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00435-018-00430-4,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Annelida, ""Phyllodocida""",Nervous system,NULL,Musculature; Confocal microscopy ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We provide computer-based 3D reconstructions of all organ systems and ultrastructural data on the digestive and renopericardial systems. Several aspects of the external morphology and the highly concentrated central nervous system in <i>P. paradoxus</i> are paedomorphic. The presence of a vestigial pericardium without a heart is interpreted as co-adaptation to the minute, vermiform body with a relatively large surface. The (partially) triaulic hermaphroditic genital system shows a small penis, suggesting true copulation as mode of sperm transfer. We provide a molecular barcode and a neotype in line with our detailed 3D microanatomy and ultrastructural data to establish a baseline for revision of Pseudovermidae. The current taxonomy of Pseudovermidae in European waters is likely artificially inflated, impeding a better understanding of distribution and diversification within the clade. Our study highlights the need for a taxonomic revision of European pseudovermid species based on molecular data, as traditional taxonomic characters mostly present a higher intraspecific rather than interspecific variation or might present artifacts (i.e., “denticulated” jaws).","Flammensbeck, C.K.; Haszprunar, G.; Korshunova, T.; Martynov, A.V.; Neusser, T.P.; Jörger, K.M.",WOS:000458462900004,"Flammensbeck, Christina, C.K.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13127-018-0386-2,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Nudibranchia, ""Pseudovermis paradoxus""","Meiofauna, ""Morphology""",NULL,Paedomorphosis; Progenesis; Sea slug ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the early 2000s, management actions have been implemented to reduce nutrient inputs with the aim to achieve a good ecological status as requested by the EU water framework directive. As a result of these actions, a sharp decline in nutrient loads has been recorded in several lagoons leading to an oligotrophication of the water column. The analyses of a long-term data set (1998-2015) of 21 polyhaline and euhaline lagoons with contrasting trophic status allowed us to infer a general scheme for the changes in macrophyte assemblages during the oligotrophication process. Placing hypertrophic and oligotrophic conditions end to end, we inferred that the general pattern for the re-oligotrophication trajectory in Mediterranean coastal lagoons is described by the following sequence, with regime shifts between each state: (1) bare non-vegetated sediments, phytoplankton-dominated state; (2) opportunistic macroalgae; (3) seagrass and perennial macroalgae dominated state. However, we did not observe the latter regime shift for the most eutrophicated lagoons, which, so far, remained stuck in the opportunistic macroalgae state. So far, the shift from dominance of opportunistic macroalgae to a system dominated by seagrasses was only observed in a single lagoon where seagrasses had never completely disappeared, which possibly relates to resilience. More generally, the conditions favoring regime shifts from opportunistic macroalgae to seagrasses are still poorly understood. In conclusion, we describe a generic pattern for re-oligotrophication of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, although a full recovery from highly eutrophied to oligotrophic conditions may require more than a decade and may include conditions that remain so far poorly recognized.","Le Fur, I.; De Wit, R.; Plus, M.; Oheix, J.; Derolez, V.; Simier, M.; Malet, N.; Ouisse, V.",WOS:000456206700002,"Simier, Monique, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12814,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Recovery, ""Resilience"", ""Restoration""",NULL,Submerged aquatic vegetation; Nutrient reduction; Long-term data series; Regime shift; Coastal lagoon ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Amplifying and sequencing marker genes (i.e., metabarcoding) from eDNA can reveal the wide range of taxa present in an ecosystem through analysis of a single water sample. Metabarcoding of eDNA provides higher resolution data than visual surveys, aiding in assessments of ecosystem health. This study conducted eDNA metabarcoding of two molecular markers (cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) to survey eukaryotic diversity across multiple trophic levels in surface water samples collected at three sites along the coral reef tract within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) during four research cruises in 2015. The 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered 785 genera while the COI gene sequences recovered 115 genera, with only 33 genera shared between the two datasets, emphasizing the complementarity of these marker genes. Community composition for both genetic markers clustered by month of sample collection, suggesting that temporal variation has a larger effect on biodiversity than spatial variability in the FKNMS surface waters. Sequences from both marker genes were dominated by copepods, but each marker recovered distinct phytoplankton groups, with 18S rRNA gene sequences dominated by dinoflagellates and COI sequences dominated by coccolithophores. Although eDNA samples were collected from surface waters, many benthic species such as sponges, crustaceans, and corals were identified. These results show the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for cataloging biodiversity to establish an ecosystem baseline against which future samples can be compared in order to monitor community changes.","Sawaya, N.A.; Djurhuus, A.; Closek, C.J.; Hepner, M.; Olesin, E.; Visser, L.; Kelble, C.; Hubbard, K.; Breitbart, M.",WOS:000461112200009,"Sawaya, Natalie, N.A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.4742,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

These data types support international policies and directives, needed for species and habitat conservation. As aquatic systems are highly interconnected and cross administrative borders, optimal data gathering should be organized on a large scale. This need triggered the development of regional, national and international aquatic animal tracking network initiatives around the globe. In Belgium, a national acoustic receiver network for fish tracking, called the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network, was set up in 2014 with different research institutes collaborating. It is a permanent network with 160 acoustic receivers and since the start, over 800 animals from 16 different fish species have been tagged and generated more than 17 million detections so far. To handle all the (meta)data generated, a data management platform was built. The central database stores all the data and has an interactive web interface that allows the users to upload, manage and explore (meta)data. In addition, the database is linked to an R-shiny application to allow the user to visualize and download the detection data. The permanent tracking network is not only a collaborative platform for exchange of data, analysis tools, devices and knowledge. It also creates opportunities to perform feasibility studies and Ph.D. studies in a cost-efficient way. The Belgian tracking network is a first step towards a Pan-European aquatic tracking network.

Terraces ascribable to the last interglacial, the Marine Isotope Stage 5e (MIS5e, ~125kyr BP), predominate and contain a well preserved fossil legacy of sea life at the time. Molluscs proved to represent the most diverse component in the macrobenthos, overwhelming at species up to family levels other benthic groups. As many as 124 families of marine molluscs have been identified in this fossil system, 86 of which pertain to Gastropoda, 31 to Bivalvia, 5 to Polyplacophora and 2 to Scaphopoda. No less than 277 genera are represented in the fossil mollusc fauna, and the diversity is well in excess of 400 species. Molluscs are a fundamental clue for classifying with relative precision the former habitats preserved in these MIS5e coral systems. By and large, the MIS5e deposits document former back reef to fore-reef environments and, to a minor degree, beach or mangal settings. The fauna includes also some index-fossils of ecostratigraphic significance for recognizing MIS5e deposits in the Red Sea.

Such activities pose significant long-term disturbances and potentially severe impacts to both ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as associated ecosystem services. The Rio Grande Rise presents a severely understudied area, with very little knowledge on either local and regional scales. Most detailed knowledge available is centered on highly localised geological information and interpolated and/or modelled environmental data, while high-resolution data on biogeography, ecosystem processes and functioning are lacking. The Rio Grande Rise is most likely a remnant of the Paraná-Etendeka igneous province, and formed when the African and South-American plates separated to form the Southern Atlantic basin, about 75 million years ago. More recent cruises have generated very local and high-resolution acoustic impedance data on the substrate, showing extremely dense layers, likely to be cobalt-rich crusts and underlying bedrock, interspersed with thick sediment layers. Literature studies revealed that nowadays the Rise appears to be located within a relatively low-productivity oceanic region. Open-database mining yielded large-scale, extrapolated environmental data rasters, which show the Rise to be an oceanic region relatively free of pollution and anthropogenic disturbances, with high geomorphological heterogeneity and potential for high biodiversity. This image was confirmed in a small number of scientific submarine cruises, where a diverse range of seascapes was observed, from soft sediment to carbonate pavement and cobalt crust outcrops. Especially the latter substrata were found to be inhabited by diverse benthic communities, dominated by sessile organisms, presenting three-dimensional structural heterogeneity and with associated vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Cobalt-rich crusts appear to grow at an extremely slow rate of several mm per million years, in the deep ocean where biological and ecological processes such as reproduction, growth and recolonisation are characterised by slow dynamics. The main disturbances posed by deep-sea mining of cobalt-rich crusts on the Rio Grande Rise consist of (1) complete removal of substrate with its particular benthic communities, (2) strong localised increases in suspended particulate matter, causing smothering of breathing apparatus and dilution of food particles, (3) crushing by tailings and overburden and (4) toxicity effects by released metals and other toxic substances, likely to be increased under high pressure. These impacts will likely change the deep-sea ecosystem at the Rio Grande Rise and its functioning for time scales in the order of decades to centuries. State-of-the-art geological, environmental and ecological modelling, complemented with high-quality, fine-resolution data are needed to provide a detailed evaluation of the impacts of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crust mining in the Rio Grande Rise, with the goal to formulate strategic environmental management plans.","Montserrat, F; Guilhon, M.; Corrêa, P.V.F.; Bergo, N.M.; Signori, C.N.; Tura, P.M.; de los Santos Maly, M.; Moura, D.; Millo, C.; Jovane, L.; Pellizari, V.H.; Sumida, P.Y.G.; Brandini, F.P.; Turra, A.",WOS:000465055400003,"Guilhon, Maila, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2018.12.007,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Cobalt crust; Ferromanganese; South Atlantic; Brazil; Anthropogenic pressure; Cumulative impacts; environmental management plan; oceanographic data,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here we present results of an experimental study to address variation in standard metabolic rates, over different scales of organisation and environments, within a specific group of aquatic macro-invertebrates (i.e. gammarid amphipods) that represent the primary consumers in detritus food webs. The study was carried out using flow-through microrespirometric techniques on male specimens of three gammarid species from freshwater, transitional water and marine ecosystems. We examined individual metabolic rate variations at three scales: (1) at the individual level, during an 8 h period of daylight; (2) at the within-population level, along body-size and body-condition gradients; (3) at the interspecific level, across species occurring in the field in the three different categories of aquatic ecosystems, from freshwater to marine. We show that standard metabolic rates vary significantly at all three scales examined, with the highest variation observed at the within-population level. Variation in individual standard metabolic rates during the daylight hours was generally low (coefficient of variation, CV<10 %) and unrelated to time. The average within-population CV ranged between 30.0 % and 35.0 %, with body size representing a significant source of overall inter-individual variation in the three species and individual body condition exerting only a marginal influence. In all species, the allometric equations were not as steep as would be expected from the 3∕4 power law, with significant variation in mass-specific metabolic rates among populations. The population from the transitional water ecosystem had the highest mass-specific metabolic rates and the lowest within-population variation. In the gammarid species studied here, body-size-independent variations in standard individual metabolic rates were higher than those explained by allometric body size scaling, and the costs of adaptation to short-term periodic variations in water salinity in the studied ecosystems also seemed to represent a major source of variation.","Shokri, M.; Ciotti, M.; Vignes, F.; Gjoni, V.; Basset, A.",WOS:000455520200001,"Basset, Alberto, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/we-19-1-2019,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Until now, many researchers used a limited number of (morpho-)species, and considered the numerous varieties as ecophenotypes. Recently, molecular studies show that these putative ecophenotypes are, in reality, well-separated genetically and should rather be considered as separate species. This study aims to investigate the morphological characteristics of three phylotypes (T1, T2, and T6) belonging to the genus Ammonia, encountered along European coasts. For this purpose, Ammonia specimens were sampled at 22 locations between 2014 and 2016 and were imaged using an environmental SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). For 96 specimens, images of the spiral, umbilical, and peripheral sides were obtained and pore features were investigated using 1000x magnified images of the penultimate chamber on the spiral side. Sixty-one morphometric parameters were measured for each individual. To assign specimens to their respective phylotypes, we employed molecular analyses using SSU (Small Sub-Unit) rDNA fragments. A multivariate approach (Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data, FAMD), allowing the joint analysis of quantitative and qualitative measurements, was used to determine the most reliable morphometric parameters to discriminate the three phylotypes. Our results show that the use of only two morphological characteristics is sufficient to differentiate the three pseudocryptic species: the raised or flush character of the sutures on the central part of the spiral side and the mean pore diameter. These two criteria, which can be observed with a standard stereomicroscope, provide an efficient method to discriminate T1, T2, and T6 with at least 90% accuracy. We consider that there is still insufficient information to reliably assign previously defined formal scientific names to the three phylotypes, and therefore we recommend the continued use of phylotype designations T1, T2, and T6. Our results make it possible to study the distribution of these three pseudocryptic species (T1, T2, and T6) on the basis of stereomicroscope examination alone, which means these species can also be more easily recognized in dead/fossil assemblages. Among other things, this will allow verification in sediment cores of the putative recent introduction in European coastal areas of T6, which is often considered an exotic species originating from East Asia.","Richirt, J.; Schweizer, M.; Bouchet, V.M.P.; Mouret, A.; Quinchard, S.; Jorissen, F.",WOS:000457207500007,"Richirt, Julien, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2113/gsjfr.49.1.76,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Ammonia,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The aim of this study is to assess the status and distribution of the macrozoobenthos during the spring flood period, when the volume of the Pechora River discharge shows a 5- to 7-fold increase, and to determine the relationship of macrozoobenthos distribution to environmental factors. The intensive river runoff provokes ice scouring of the bottom sediments in shallow areas, causing low species richness, abundance and biomass. It was found that estuarine species spread to the entrance of the bay in flood time but the dominant species in five determined communities remain stable. The strongest driver for species richness and biomass is sediment granulometric composition. Shannon diversity (H′) negatively correlated with the organic matter content of the sediments.

This study examined the impacts of oil and dispersants on the composition and physiology of natural marine phytoplankton communities from the Gulf of Mexico during a 72-hour mesocosm experiment and consequences to carbon export. The communities were treated using the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, which was produced by adding Macondo surrogate oil to natural seawater and mixed for 24 h in the dark. A chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) was made in a similar manner, but using a mixture of oil and the dispersant Corexit in a 20:1 ratio as well as a diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF). Phytoplankton communities exposed to WAF showed no significant changes in PSII quantum yield (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) or electron transfer rates (ETR<sub>max</sub>) compared to Control communities. In contrast, both F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> and ETR<sub>max</sub> declined rapidly in communities treated with either CEWAF or DCEWAF. Analysis of other photophysiological parameters showed that photosystem II (PSII) antenna size and PSII connectivity factor were not altered by exposure to DCEWAF, suggesting that processes downstream of PSII were affected. The eukaryote community composition in each experimental tank was characterized at the end of the 72 h exposure time using 18S rRNA sequencing. Diatoms dominated the communities in both the control and WAF treatments (52 and 56% relative abundance respectively), while in CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments were dominated by heterotrophic Euglenozoa (51 and 84% respectively). Diatoms made up the largest relative contribution to the autotrophic eukaryote community in all treatments. EPS concentration was four times higher in CEWAF tanks compared to other treatments. Changes in particle size distributions (a proxy for aggregates) over time indicated that a higher degree of particle aggregation occurred in both the CEWAF and DCEWAF treatments than the WAF or Controls.

Very fine woody debris (VFWD) forms an important component of this dead wood, being found in any forest in the World. Among European and Romanian forests, <i>Fagus</i> spp. dominating forests are the most important broadleaved ecosystems, of great biotic and abiotic complexity. The present distribution of lignicolous fungi is mainly linked to trees distribution. In the context of climate change, European beech forests will also shift in distribution, structure and composition, triggering changes in lignicolous fungal communities and diversity as well. Considering this background, VFWD lignicolous diversity might be a future beech forests climate change indicator. This will bring the necessity of assessing the main climatic factors that are influencing the lignicolous fungal diversity distribution across European beech forests in Romanian's North-East Region. In the present study, our findings confirms the fact that macroclimate have a great influence on lignicolous mycodiversity in beech forests. It seems that minimum temperature and Gams Continentality Index explains approximately 48% of the mycodiversity variation. While dropping minimum temperatures and increasing Gams CI values, the lignicolous fungal richness will rise. While minimum temperature of January might be linked to a complex ecological and phonological framework, Gams CI is a known ecological indicator for optimum habitat of beech forests, which in turn influence lignicolous diversity distribution. Those climatic variables might characterize the relation between plants-fungi-climate in the near future, as increasing atmospheric temperatures will manifest at different scales. Thereafter, VFWD mycodiversity might function as a valuable macroclimatic changing indicator.","Copot, O.; Balaes, T.; Birsan, C.; Petre, C.V.; Cojocariu, A.; Tanase, C.",NULL,"Balaes, Tiberius, T.",NULL,NULL,NULL,Lifewatch acknowledged,NULL,Fagus,NULL,NULL,"European beech, beech forests, climatic predictors, VFWD, lignicolous fungi, mycodiversity, BIO6, Gams Continentality Index",Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, actual data on the prevalence of <i>A. vasorum</i> and other metastrongyloid lungworm larvae in a wide range of slug and snail intermediate hosts, such as <i>Arion lusitanicus</i>, are missing for Germany. To fill this gap, we conducted an epidemiological survey on native German slugs in selected regions of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate. The focus was on slugs, because in study areas slugs appear to be more abundant than snails. Slugs were collected throughout different seasons of the year in areas that were previously proven to be hyperendemic for <i>A. vasorum</i> fox infections. Overall, a total of 2701 slugs were collected and examined for lungworm larvae via artificial digestion. The number of <i>A. vasorum</i> larvae per slug varied considerably (1–546 larvae per specimen). Some hotspot areas with high <i>A. vasorum</i> prevalence in slugs (up to 19.4%) were identified. The overall <i>A. vasorum</i> prevalence varied with season with largest number of slugs infected in summer (9.1%) and lowest number in winter (0.8%).

Since that time, OBIS has expanded its goals beyond simply hosting data to supporting more aspects of marine conservation (Pooter et al. 2017). In order to accomplish those goals, the OBIS secretariat in partnership with its European node (EurOBIS) hosted at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ, Belgium), and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Committee on International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE, 23rd session, March 2015, Brugge) established a 2-year pilot project to address a particularly problematic issue that environmental data collected as part of marine biological research were being disassociated from the biological data. OBIS-Event-Data is the solution that was developed from that pilot project, which devised a method for keeping environmental data together with the biological data (Pooter et al. 2017). OBIS is seeking early adopters of the new data standard OBIS-Event-Data from among the marine biodiversity monitoring communities, to further validate the data standard, and develop data products and scientific applications to support the enhancement of Biological and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in the framework of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO BON MBON). After the successful 2-year IODE pilot project OBIS-ENV-DATA, the IOC established a new 2-year IODE pilot project OBIS-Event-Data for Scientific Applications (2017-2019). The OBIS-Event-Data data standard, building on Darwin Core, provides a technical solution for combined biological and environmental data, and incorporates details about sampling methods and effort, including event hierarchy. It also implements standardization of parameters involved in biological, environmental, and sampling details using an international standard controlled vocabulary (British Oceanographic Data Centre Natural Environment Research Council). A workshop organized by IODE/OBIS in April brought together major animal tagging and tracking networks such as the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN), the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the European Tracking Network (ETN) and the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP) to test the OBIS-Event- Data standard through the development of some data products and science applications. Additionally, this workshop contributes to the further maturation of the GOOS EOV on fish as well as the EOV on birds, mammals and turtles. We will present the outcomes as well as any lessons learned from this workshop on problems, solutions, and applications of using Darwin Core/OBIS-Event-Data for biologging data.","Benson, A.; Appeltans, W.; Bajona, L.; Bosch, B.; Cowley, P.D.; De Pooter, D.; Desmet, P.; Harcourt, R.; Hoenner, X.; Pye, J.; Van de Putte, A.; Walsh, P.; Woodward, B.",NULL,"Walsh, Peter, P.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.2.25728,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,Biological data,NULL,Event Core; telemetry data; environmental data,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Small predatory sea stars (<em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Leptasterias</em> spp.) caused herbivorous snails (<em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Tegula funebralis)</em> added to rocky intertidal tidepools to quickly flee into refuge microhabitats outside tidepools within days, and this was associated with a 58% increase in microalgal growth after 2 weeks. Similarly, removing sea stars caused snails to increase use of tidepools for 1–10 months. After adding sea stars to tidepools, snails quickly fled and then consistently increased use of refuges outside tidepools for 10 months. This was associated with average increases of 59% for microalgal growth over 1 month and 254% for macroalgal growth over 8 months inside tidepools. In 63 unmanipulated tidepools, densities of sea stars and snails were negatively correlated. High densities of snails were associated with unpalatable algal species and bare rock, while high densities of sea stars were associated with palatable algal species, suggesting that this apparent TMII may have community-level impacts. Though multiple lines of evidence suggest TMIIs were likely operating in this system, it was not possible to experimentally partition the relative contributions of TMIIs and density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), so further caging experiments are necessary to distinguish their relative strengths. Overall, we suggest that predators can benefit primary producers by changing prey behavior even when predators and prey are unrestrained by cages or mesocosms, embedded in complex communities, and observed over multiple time scales.","Gravem, S.A.; Morgan, S.G.",WOS:000456602900001,"Morgan, Steven, S.G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-019-3469-5,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Although the resource its distributed along the coast of the Baja California peninsula, its overfishing along with mass mortalities have reduced it to the limit it was necessary to implement a time undefined ban on the fishery. Production from aquaculture has been insufficient, and the laboratory generated spat has an altered allele frequency, so it possesses risk to the natural populations. The Restriction Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), it’s a very useful technique for genomic evaluation of populations, allowing to recover thousands of markers at relative low cost. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are an example of this markers, commonly used to assess population structure and genetic divergence. The present study analyzed RAD-seq derived SNP’s to describe five natural populations of lion paw scallops and one laboratory derived spats stock (SEM). A low population structure was observed amongst the wild samples. Genetic components analysis (admixture) and Discriminant Principal Components Analysis (DPCA) indicate a unique group amongst wild samples. Artificial population (SEM) presented a genetic diversity similar to the natural populations. However, individuals in this artificial group have a significantly different fixation index (Fis). The admixture and DPCA tests indicate this artificial group is different to the wild populations. These results suggest there is a single population of lion paw scallops around the peninsula, with some populations having a unique demography that affects the Fis but the same genetic components. Laboratory produced spat results in a genetically different composition. This work sets the basis for directed laboratory spat production, for aquaculture but also for resettlement of the natural populations of this economic and ecological resource.","Vargas Bravo, M.H.",NULL,"Vargas Bravo, Manuek Hueman, M.H.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nodipecten subnodosus,"Bivalves, ""Genomics"", ""Populations""",NULL,RAD-seq; SNP’s.,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

One of the most conclusive cases of HGT in metazoans was previously described for the cellulose synthase gene in ascidians. Results: In this study we identified a new protein, rusticalin, from the ascidian Styela rustica and presented evidence for its likely origin by HGT. Discernible homologues of rusticalin were found in placozoans, coral, and basal Chordates. Rusticalin was predicted to consist of two distinct regions, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain comprises two cysteine-rich repeats and shows remote similarity to the tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor. The C-terminal domain shares significant sequence similarity with bacterial MD peptidases and bacteriophage A500 L-alanyl-D-glutamate peptidase. A possible transfer of the C-terminal domain by bacteriophage was confirmed by an analysis of noncoding sequences of C. intestinalis rusticalin-like gene, which was found to contain a sequence similar to the bacteriophage A500 recombination site. Moreover, a sequence similar to the bacteriophage recombination site was found to be adjacent to the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit gene in the genome of Streptomices sp., the donor of ascidian cellulose synthase. Conclusions: The C-terminal domain of rusticalin and rusticalin-like proteins is likely to be horizontally transferred by the bacteriophage A500. A common mechanism involving bacteriophage mediated gene transfer can be proposed for at least two HGT events in ascidians.","Daugavet, M.A.; Shabelnikov, S.; Shumeev, A.; Shaposhnikova, T.; Adonin, L.S.; Podgornaya, O.",WOS:000456265400001,"Daugavet, Maria, M.A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s13100-019-0146-7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Ascidiacea, ""Trichoplax""","Bacteriophages, ""Hemocytes""",NULL,Ascidians; Horizontal gene transfer; L-alanyl-D-glutamate peptidase; tRNA,Journal article,NULL,NULL

A larger percentage of infestation occurred inside the shell, which may be harmful to the hermit crab because it reduces the internal volume. Ovigerous females used shells with a smaller percentage of infestation (40%), which may be related to the need for more space for the position and development of fertilized eggs.

Nowadays, one of the biggest issues of these scientific collections of species (marine or others) is their contextual interpretation which demands its original collection point, collectors, and original aims. The current research focuses on the origin of collections of marine specimens in Portugal as well as their historical evolution. In this particular approach, we assess the connection of the Portuguese natural history museums, universities and aquariums to similar European institutions since the mid-19th century, crossing primary sources from different archives. It was possible to reconstruct connections with the Zoological Station of the bay of Naples (Italy), the Maritime Museum of Monaco, and Aquariums of Monaco, France, and England.

Work on modern reefs has suggested that some corals will fare better than others in times of stress and that their life history traits might correlate with species survival. These same traits can be applied to fossil taxa to assess whether life history traits correspond with coral survival through past intervals of stress similar to future climate predictions. This study aims to identify whether ecological selection (based on physiology, behavior, habitat, etc.) plays a role in the long‐term survival of corals during the late Paleocene and early Eocene. The late Paleocene ‐ early Eocene interval is associated with multiple hyperthermal events that correspond to rises in atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> and sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, and increases in weathering and turbidity. Coral reefs are rare during the late Paleocene and early Eocene, but despite the lack of reef habitat, corals do not experience an extinction at the generic level and there is little extinction at the species level. In fact, generic and species richness increases throughout the late Paleocene and early Eocene. We show that corals with certain traits (coloniality, carnivorous or suspension feeding diet, hermaphroditic brooding reproduction, living in clastic settings) are more likely to survive climate change in the early Eocene. These findings have important implications for modern coral ecology and allow us to make more nuanced predictions about which taxa will have higher extinction risk in present‐day climate change.","Weiss, A.M.; Martindale, R.C.",WOS:000461857000008,"Martindale, Rowan, R.C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1029/2018pa003398,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We investigated the utility of curated ribosomal and mitochondrial nematode reference sequence databases for determining phylum‐specific species‐level clustering thresholds. We compiled 438 ribosomal and 290 mitochondrial sequences which identified 99% and 94% as the species delineation clustering threshold, respectively. These thresholds were evaluated in HTS data from mock communities containing 39 nematode species as well as environmental samples from Vietnam. We compared the taxonomic description of the mocks generated by two read‐merging and two clustering algorithms and the cluster‐free Dada2 pipeline. Taxonomic assignment with the RDP classifier was assessed under different training sets. Our results showed that 36/39 mock nematode species were identified across the molecular markers (18S: 32, JB2: 19, JB3: 21) in UClust_ref OTUs at their respective clustering thresholds, outperforming UParse_denovo and the commonly used 97% similarity. Dada2 generated the most realistic number of ASVs (18S: 83, JB2: 75, JB3: 82), collectively identifying 30/39 mock species. The ribosomal marker outperformed the mitochondrial markers in terms of species and genus‐level detections for both OTUs and ASVs. The number of taxonomic assignments of OTUs/ASVs was highest when the smallest reference database containing only nematode sequences was used and when sequences were truncated to the respective amplicon length. Overall, OTUs generated more species‐level detections, which were, however, associated with higher error rates compared to ASVs. Genus‐level assignments using ASVs exhibited higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to species‐level assignments, suggesting that this is the most reliable pipeline for rapid assessment of alpha diversity from environmental samples.","Macheriotou, L.; Guilini, K.; Bezerra, T.N.; Tytgat, B.; Nguyen, D.T.; Phuong Nguyen, T.X.; Noppe, F.; Armenteros, M.; Boufahja, F.; Rigaux, A.; Vanreusel, A.; Derycke, S.",WOS:000461112200024,"Vanreusel, Ann, A.","Marine Biology Research Group, Department of Biology, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.4814,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nematoda,NULL,NULL,metabarcoding; mock community; Nematoda; reference sequence database;UClust; USearch9,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Restoration of visual performance and opsin expression within the retina during eye regeneration in the Florida fighting conch (<i>Strombus alatus</i>). MSc Thesis. University of South Carolina, College of Arts and Sciences: South Carolina.  viii, 51 pp.","Conch are slow-moving, herbivorous, marine gastropods that possess prominent camera-type eyes at the ends of long, flexible stalks. Compared to the eyes of other gastropods, those of conch are large (up to 1.5 mm in diameter) and have sophisticated optics that include a lens with a graded refractive index. Conch also have a remarkable ability to regenerate eye tissue: after an eye is lost, a new eye will develop to take its place within weeks. Eye regeneration in conch appears to occur rapidly compared to eye regeneration in other gastropods. Despite our knowledge of the complexity and regenerative abilities of the eyes of conch, we know little about the visual responses of these animals either when their eyes are intact or while they are regenerating. Therefore, we measured rates of eye regrowth and tested how visual performance changes during the process of eye regeneration in the Florida fighting conch, Strombus alatus. We found that rates of eye regrowth were greatest in S. alatus between 3-6 weeks following eye removal but began to slow down thereafter. We also found that conch with two intact eyes respond consistently to moving objects with angular sizes of 24° or greater and angular speeds between 27 and 82 °/s. We removed either one or both eyes from 24 conch and recorded the behavioral responses of these animals to visual stimuli once a week for twelve weeks. We found that the visual performance of conch with the left eye removed never declined to begin with, suggesting that they successfully compensated with their intact right eye. However, the visual performance of conch with the right eye and both eyes removed declined immediately following eye removal but was regained four weeks and seven weeks thereafter, respectively. To learn more about the process of eye regeneration in conch, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize the expression of phototransduction proteins at different stages of eye regeneration. In the 4th week of eye regeneration, rhodopsin and Gq proteins were found to be present which suggests the return of visual performance. By studying the restoration of visual performance during eye regeneration in conch we will continue to gain more understanding of how a regenerating sensory system reconnects with an intact nervous system.","Clark, J.M.",NULL,"Clark, Jamie, J.M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

Additionally, we propose an easilycalculated index that can be used to highlight areas with unique species composition for conservation planning. We estimated the strengths of associations between environmental factors and species richness and rarity.Location: Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil, covering about 150,000 ha harbouring differentmarine habitats.Methods: We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather informationon environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined “singular” sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variationamong sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity.Results: The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species.Main conclusions: Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attentionto the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning.

The southern North Sea is a marine environment with relatively low amounts of hard-substrate areas. Surveys with high taxonomic resolution on the associated hard-substrate epifauna, e.g. by diving observations, are challenging in this region because of strong tidal currents and considerable water depths. Therefore, the characteristics and functions of hard-substrate habitats in the North Sea remain poorly understood. The goal of this study was to extend the knowledge on sessile taxa assemblages in four hard-substrate areas within the German Bight (SE North Sea) using underwater video observations as a straight-forward and visual method to obtain and process detailed data on seafloor characteristics. Still images from drift videos were analyzed to determine the epifaunal assemblages attached to the stones on a presence/absence scale. A subsample of cobbles, boulders and large boulders was further investigated to derive quantitative data on the colonized area for each taxon and stone size. The four areas showed significant differences in sessile taxa richness, with higher numbers of sessile taxa in the deeper far-shore areas than in the shallower nearshore areas, despite a generally high similarity in the sessile animal taxa spectrum. Within the areas, cobbles were mainly dominated by short-lived taxa (<5 years) like Spirobranchus triqueter and ascidians, while boulder-sized stones were largely colonized by long-lived taxa (>5 years) like Metridium dianthus, Flustra foliacea and Alcyonium digitatum. Most of the stones were typically covered by epifauna by more than 50%. The differences in the sessile taxa spectrum between the areas were interpreted as a consequence of reduced abiotic stress and higher habitat complexity in the far-shore areas. The dominance of short-lived taxa on cobbles, in comparison to long-lived taxa on boulder-sized stones, possibly reflects the frequency of disturbance and the competitiveness of these taxa.","Michaelis, R.; Hass, H.C.; Mielck, F.; Papenmeier, S.; Sander, L.; Gutow, L.; Wiltshire, K.H.",WOS:000461402200003,"Michaelis, Rune, R.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.csr.2019.01.011,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",North Sea,NULL,Epibenthos,NULL,Shallow shelf sea; Reef; Biotic interactions; Video observation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Considerable complexity in marine trophic structure can exist due to the presence of highly mobile species with long life spans. Mobula rays are highly mobile, large, planktivorous elasmobranchs that are frequently caught either directly or as bycatch in fisheries, which, combined with their conservative life history strategy, makes their populations susceptible to decline in intensely fished regions. Effective management of these iconic and vulnerable species requires an understanding of the diets that sustain them, which can be difficult to determine using conventional sampling methods. We use three DNA metabarcode assays to identify 44 distinct taxa from the stomachs (n = 101) of four sympatric <i>Mobula</i> ray species (<i>Mobula birostris, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula japanica</i>, and <i>Mobula thurstoni</i>) caught over 3 years (2013–2015) in a direct fishery off Bohol in the Philippines.

CRC Press: Boca Raton. ISBN 9780429584480. 300 pp.","This book is a concise informative elucidation of all aspects of reproduction and development in annelids covering from Arenicola to Tubifex. Annelids flourish between 4,900 m depth to 2,000 m altitude; some of them occur in unusual habitats like hydrothermal vents and subterranean aquatic system (stigobionts). A few have no gut and acquire adequate nutrients through osmotrophism and/or engaging symbiotic microbes. In the absence of exoskeleton to escape predation, the 17,000 speciose annelids have explored bewildering modes of reproduction; not surprisingly, 42–47% of them are brooders. With 13,000 species, polychaetes are gonochores but some 207 species of them are hermaphrodites. Clitellates are all hermaphrodites; of them, 76 species are parthenogens, of which 56 are earthworms. Regenerative potency of annelids ranges from an organ to an entire worm from a single ‘seminal’ segment. The head, tail and both together can be regenerated 21, 42 and 20 times, respectively. However, the potency is limited to ~1% of polychaetes and < 2% of oligochaetes. In oligochaetes, the chloragogue temporally separates regeneration and reproduction but sedentary polychaetes undertake them together at the reduced reproductive output. Only 79 polychaete and 111 oligochaete species have the potency for clonal reproduction. Within families, the potency ranges from 2% in spionids to 54% in naidids. Epitoky, a spectacular and unique phenomenon, involves the transformation from benthic to meroplanktonic reproductive morphism. It occurs in 106 errant polychaete species. The larger glycerides, nereidids and eunicids use muscular energy to climb < 50 m vertical distance. But the small phyllodocids and cteniodrilids may reduce buoyancy to climb 1,000–4,000 m vertical distance. Heterogamatic sex determination is reported to occur only in six polychaete species, although karyotype is known for 83 annelid species. In temperate polychaetes, a dozen neuroendocrines, arising mostly from the ‘brain’ regulates reproductive cycle. A complete chapter devoted to vermiculture, (i) recognizes the fast-growing candidate species, (ii) distinguishes 'layers' from 'brooders', (iii) indicates that the harvest of oligochaetes may reduce the input of nitrogenous fertilizer in the ricefield, and (iv) explores the scope for increasing wealth from waste.","Pandian, T.J.",NULL,"Pandian, Thavamani, T.J.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,NULL,NULL

A 15N labelled particulate food source (rotifers) was used to quantify the incorporation of prey nitrogen into the nitrogen pools (coral, algal tissues and skeletal organic matter) of Porites lutea, and to estimate the time taken for the δ15N signature of source nitrogen to be reflected in the different tissue fractions of the coral holobiont. Neither coral nor algal fractions displayed the full expression of the food source δ15N over a 60 d experimental period. The response of the skeletal δ15N value to the food δ15N was slower than the coral tissue, but this may have been caused by coarse sampling resolution coupled with a short experimental period. Using a mass-balance model, we determined that the corals must have been augmenting their rotifer diets by up to 50% with dissolved nitrogen from the water column. Using the δ15N of the combined food source (i.e. dissolved and rotifer nitrogen), we calculated tissue turnover rates of 87 d for the coral tissue and 111 d for the algal symbionts. These values dictate that the duration of any change in the δ15N of a coral’s N source needs to be greater than 3 mo to register its full magnitude in the tissue and skeletal nitrogen pools. This has implications for studies in which the host, symbiont and skeletal δ15N are used as a proxy for temporal changes in the source of nitrogen to coral reefs. Our results also support the notion of a bidirectional exchange of N between the coral and algae fractions, and provide estimations of the assimilation and excretion of N during heterotrophic feeding.","Rangel, M.S.; Erler, D.V.; Tagliafico, A.; Cowden, K.; Scheffers, S.; Christidis, L.",WOS:000464515700003,"Rangel, Maria Salomé, M.S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12847,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Great Barrier Reef,Porites,NULL,NULL, Coral nutrient recycling;  Nitrogen isotopes; Palaeo-oceanographic reconstructions ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Polychaetes are numerically dominant components of marine macrobenthos, playing a key role in benthic productivity. They are also the most problematic group regarding body‐size assessments due to common fragmentation of fragile bodies during sample processing that inhibits direct assessments of their size and biomass. Here, we present quantified relationships that allow an estimation of the total‐body length based on morphometric features (widths of thoracic chaetigers) that remain intact after standard macrobenthic sample treatment. The best‐fitted regression equations (p < 0.001, r from 0.41 to 0.99) were selected for 28 polychaete families, six orders, two infraclasses, and one subclass based on the measurements on 3580 complete individuals collected in the North Atlantic (Norwegian and Spitsbergen fjords and continental margin). In Capitellidae, Cirratulidae, Oweniidae, and Trichobranchidae, the shapes of the relationships differed among dominant species/genera, and so, specific formula was proposed. The method has been applied to assess the size spectra of macrozoobenthos based on 18 van Veen grab samples collected at six stations in two Spitsbergen fjords. The percentage contribution of complete individuals in polychaete biomass and abundance in size classes varied between 0% and 43%, with the lowest percentages noted in two dominant families—Cirratulidae and Lumbrineridae. The presented method is likely to be widely applied in studies requiring polychaete individual size assessments (e.g., benthic biomass size spectra, population dynamics, and secondary production).","Górska, B.; Gromisz, S.; Wlodarska-Kowalczuk, M.",WOS:000464952100002,"Gromisz, Slawomira, S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/lom3.10310,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We show that some regions are shock hotspots, exposed frequently to shocks across multiple sectors. Critically, shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global scale. Geopolitical and extreme-weather events were the main shock drivers identified, but with considerable differences across sectors. We illustrate how social and ecological drivers, influenced by the dynamics of the food system, can spill over multiple food sectors and create synchronous challenges or trade-offs among terrestrial and aquatic systems.

We developed a new framework to assist planning environmental representativity in a network across the marine space of Portugal, responding to a political commitment to protect 14% of its area by 2020. An aggregate conservation value was estimated for each of the 27 habitats identified, from intertidal waters to the deep sea. This value was based on expert-judgment scoring for environmental properties and features relevant for conservation, chosen to reflect the strategic objectives of the network, thus providing an objective link between conservation commitments and habitat representativity in space. Additionally, habitats' vulnerability to existing anthropogenic pressures and sensitivity to climate change were also scored. The area coverage of each habitat in Portugal and within existing MPAs (regionally and nationally) was assigned to a scale of five orders of magnitude (from <0.01% to >10%) to assess rarity and existing representation. Aggregate conservation value per habitat was negatively correlated with area coverage, positively correlated with vulnerability and was not correlated with sensitivity. The proposed framework offers a multi-dimensional support tool for MPA network development, in particular regarding the prioritization of new habitats to protect, when the goal is to achieve specific targets while ensuring representativity across large areas and complex habitat mosaics. It requires less information and computation effort in comparison to more quantitative approaches, while still providing an objective instrument to scrutinize progress on the implementation of politically set conservation targets.","Stratoudakis, Y.; Hilario, A.; Ribeiro, C.; Abecasis, D.; Gonçalves, E.J.; Andrade, F.; Carreira, G.P.; Freitas, L.; Pinheiro, L.M.; Batista, M.I.; Henriques, M.; Oliveira, P.B.; Oliveira, P.; Afonso, P.; Arriegas, P.I.; Henriques, S.",WOS:000465448800028,"Ribeiro, Cláudia, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00545,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Habitat diversity; Conservation value; Planning framework; Temperate North-east Atlantic and Macaronesia; Iberian margin and shelf; Portugal,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, the impact of navigation locks on downstream migrating fish is rarely documented. In Belgium, the Albert Canal connecting the Meuse River to the Scheldt Estuary may offer migration opportunities for European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) and Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>), two critically endangered species. During their downstream migration phase (respectively silver eels and salmon smolts), both species have to pass five intermediate-head navigation locks before reaching the estuary. Previous research showed that silver eel escapement is largely unsuccessful and that eels are delayed extensively at the navigation lock complexes. To get a better understanding of the mechanisms behind these failures and delays, we tagged and released 62 silver eels and 44 salmon smolts in the vicinity of one navigation lock complex of the canal. This paper reports the mechanisms behind the previously perceived delay, the route choices to pass the complex, and the risks involved. Of the 65% tagged eels and 73% tagged smolts that succeeded to pass the complex, respectively, 20% and 41% needed more than one trial to pass the complex. Moreover, 52% of all trials were via intakes of the lock filling system, at least four smolts (17%) died after intake passing, and about 30% of both intake-passing smolts and eels stopped migrating after passage. Therefore, intermediate-head navigation locks are a potential threat to downstream migrating fish, which requires more research to fully investigate its impact.","Vergeynst, J.; Pauwels, I.; Baeyens, R.; Coeck, J.; Nopens, I.; De Mulder, T.; Mouton, A.",WOS:000461064400003,"Vergeynst, Jenna, J.","BIOMATH, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/rra.3403,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,"Anguilla anguilla, ""Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758""",NULL,European eel,Atlantic salmon; downstream fish migration; European eel;  fish-friendliness; navigation locks,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Despite of this, there is not enough information about its biology and less about the reproduction of this species. The aim of this study was to obtain information related to the reproductive biology of <i>M. peruvianus</i> from the port of Salaverry (La Libertad). Monthly samplings were made of the fishing landings of this species during October 2017 to November 2018, achieving a total of 160 specimens. Data of disc width (DW), weight, sex and clasper calcification were obtained and liver and gonads were collected. Sexual maturity was determined comparing clasper length and calcification in males and in females by comparing gonadal structure, for corroboration histological samples processed in paraplast and with haematoxylin-eosin staining were taken. 80 males (41–153 cm DW) and 80 females (42–221.6 cm DW) were obtained finding a 1:1 sex ratio. Average ovarian fecundity was 32 oocytes and average size-at-maturity was estimated in 163 cm and 122 cm DW for males and females respectively. Mature ovaries were sampled only during the second half of each year. The anatomy of gonads is described and no embryos were found. Since minimum capture sizes are based on the average estimated size-at-maturity, the reproductive aspects studied may help in the decision making for better management, a sustainable exploitation and the conservation of the fishery of this species.

To better understand these relationships, data from field and museum collected samples of South Africa were combined to test for the associations between host and parasite length for three mouth and one gill chamber-infesting genera (<i>Ceratothoa, Cinusa, Cymothoa</i>, and <i>Mothocya</i> respectively). Generally, the number of parasites collected from 90 h of museum surveying was similar to that of seven, one-week long field collections.

Here we combine dense taxon sampling with 108 deep-sequenced Illumina-based transcriptomes to provide resolution in nodes that required additional study. We designed specific data matrices to address the poorly resolved relationships within Imparidentia. Our results support the overall backbone of the bivalve tree, the monophyly of Bivalvia and all its main nodes, although the monophyly of Protobranchia remains less clear. Likewise, the inter-relationships of the six main bivalve clades were fully supported. Within Imparidentia, resolution increases when analysing Imparidentia-specific matrices. Lucinidae, Thyasiridae and Gastrochaenida represent three early branches. Gastrochaenida is sister group to all remaining imparidentians, which divide into six orders. Neoheterodontei is always fully supported, and consists of Sphaeriida, Myida and Venerida, with the latter now also containing Mactroidea, Ungulinoidea and Chamidae, a family particularly difficult to place in earlier work.

Hg is a serious threat especially for the marine environment, in which it undergoes bioaccumulation and biomagnification, reaching elevated concentrations in fish and other seafood. The research aimed at investigating the trophodynamics of Hg in the basal links of the marine food chain: benthic macrofauna and its main food sources (i.e. suspended and sediment organic matter, micro- and macrophytobenthos). The results showed that both the amount and the origin of organic matter affected the Hg level in particular trophic groups of macrozoobenthos. The intensive inflow of terrestrial material influenced the enrichment of suspended particles and microphytobenthos in Hg, leading to increased Hg concentrations in filter-feeding macrofauna. The input of Hg-rich marine matter transported from the deeper parts of the Gulf of Gdańsk along with the near-bottom currents caused higher Hg levels in deposit feeders. The biomagnification factor (BMF) of Hg through benthic food web was dependent on environmental conditions occurring in the studied areas, in particular, factors favouring the growth and fecundity of macrofauna. Consequently, as a result of biodilution, the trophic transfer of Hg was less effective in a more productive region, despite the elevated Hg concentrations in dietary components of the macrofauna and in the surrounding environment.","Jedruch, A.; Beldowska, M.; Ziolkowska, M.",WOS:000458176700005,"Ziolkowska, Marcelina, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10661-019-7257-y,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Mercury,NULL,Macrozoobenthos; Coastal food web; Trophic transfer; Biomagnification; Baltic Sea ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Sixteen most relevant published studies were examined as the source of secondary information wherein 62% of which are in temperate waters and 38% are in tropical waters. Spawning of scallops from tropical and temperate environments were reportedly affected by and correlated to mostly variations in water temperature, the most influential factor identified to naturally activate spawning. In temperate waters, about 90% of the spawning of different species occurs during warm months or when highest temperature was recorded (summer), while only 10% of the temperate species reproduce during fall (autumn) when water temperature was decreasing. Similarly in tropical waters, 67% of the spawning activities of scallops occur during warm months with few species spawning during cold months (33%). The transition or shift from cold temperature to warm temperature and vice versa seemingly served as “trigger” to spawning. A strategy to maximize collection of scallop spats for stock enhancement or grow-out mariculture should consider the warm months such as summer (i.e., March, April and May) in the Philippines when aquaculture planning and associated activities are afforded with many advantages.","Cabiles, C.D.; Soliman, V.S.",NULL,"Cabiles, Christian, C.D.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,thermal shift; latitudinal differences; reproductive biology; culture purposes,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography, as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species, which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world’s oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.","Berry, T.E.; Saunders, B.J.; Coghlan, M.L.; Stat, M.; Jarman, S.N.; Richardson, A.J.; Davies, C.H.; Berry, O.; Harvey, E.S.; Bunce, M.",WOS:000459970100030,"Richardson, A.J."," CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Cleveland, Qld 4163, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007943,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Natural communities were collected in two stations representative of the two sub-basins, at three periods with contrasting environmental characteristics to address the impact of seasonal variability. These samples were separately enriched with a full N and P enrichment, and with enrichments minus N or minus P. Phytoplankton size structuration, diversity, and growth of the total phytoplankton, the micro-, nano- and ultraphytoplankton were evaluated using spectrofluorimetry, and optical microscopy. Results showed that the communities were fueled by NO3− in the wet periods (autumn and spring) and NH4+ in summer. The phytoplankton communities displayed highest cell size in autumn, with high abundances of nanoflagellates, and smallest cell size in summer with a large dominance of phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria. Blooms of dinoflagellates also occurred during the wet periods, coinciding with high N:P ratios. The full enrichment has not stimulated phytoplankton growth in autumn, suggesting the importance of other controlling factors such as light, a possible NH4+ inhibition or the use of mixotrophic abilities. In spring, communities have displayed single P-limitation in the northern basin and different N and P co-limitations in the southern basin. In summer, the full enrichment consistently stimulated the growth of all cell sizes. The communities showed high N and P co-limitations, which is consistent with growing observations in aquatic ecosystems, and reflects the different functional responses of phytoplankton communities to the nutrient availability.","Leruste, A.; Pasqualini, V.; Garrido, M.; Malet, N.; De Wit, R.; Bec, B.",WOS:000462100000018,"Malet, N.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.014,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Eutrophication, ""Growth rate""",NULL,Dilution experiment; Functional traits,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This study utilized industry-collected footage from remotely operated vehicle inspections of pipelines to assess the interactions of benthic epifauna with pipelines, and their associated structures, for the first time. Footage was analysed from across the northern and central North Sea to examine relationships between faunal community compositions and pipelines and their protective coverings. The complex habitat of concrete and Link-lok mattresses had the highest numbers of observable taxa. Differences in community composition were largely due to varying proportions of common epilithic species. There was a weak relationship between pipeline covering type and the species composition of the immediately neighbouring substrate. Depth and latitude were the strongest correlators with the observed community compositions. This study has compiled the first dataset on epifaunal associations with subsea pipelines in the North Sea.","Lacey, N.C.; Hayes, P.",WOS:000562460200025,"Lacey, Nichola, N.C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icesjms/fsy196,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",North Sea,NULL,"Community composition, ""Decommissioning""",NULL,epifauna; pipeline; ROV,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The results illustrate that eels can distinguish between ebb and flood and suggest that tides play a role in orientation, either directly or indirectly. The general migration speed was higher in the downstream part of the estuary compared to the upstream part, while tidal migration speed was equal in both parts, indicating that eels migrated more consistently in the downstream part.

We describe latitudinal patterns in population density, body size, and gamete production in the clonal sea anemone Diadumene lineata. Fission rate in this species is highly correlated with temperature, so the rate of asexual reproduction declines with latitude. We measured the relationships among body size, gamete production, and environmental variables using individuals from 20 sites in intertidal estuaries and harbors from Florida to Maine across the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Average body size increased with latitude and decreased with temperature. Body size strongly predicts both the probability of having gametes and the number of gametes produced, such that there is a latitudinal transition from low per capita gamete production in the south to higher production in central and northern populations, with a peak in the Mid-Atlantic region. This gradient in per capita gamete production in this species runs counter to a known gradient in fission rate along the US Atlantic coast, supporting a latitudinal cline in the reproductive strategy in this species.","Ryan, W.H.; Miller, T.E.",WOS:000464518200009,"Ryan, Will, W.H.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12862,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Diadumene lineata,"Latitudinal variations, ""Temperature""",NULL,Gametogenesis; Life history plasticity; Asexual reproduction; Reproductive patterns   ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, we have investigated how salinity changes in the northwestern Arabian Gulf (NWAG) due to water regulation activities upstream of the Shatt Al-Arab River system (SAR) has influenced the hydrography and microzooplankton (tintinnid ciliates) community in the semi-arid shallow marine environment off Kuwait. Microzooplankton and water samples for environmental variables were obtained between 2004 and 2008 across several coastal and offshore locations (n=436). Microzooplankton samples showed the presence of sixty-two species of tintinnids belonging to sixteen genera and ten families. Hydrography data revealed a continuous decrease in salinity in the NWAG from 2004 until 2006 (mean salinity: 37.3; CV: 0.09), and an increase thereafter (mean salinity in 2007-2008: 39.9, CV: 0.08). The minimum increase was reported in the offshore waters (0.50), and maximum in the northern areas upstream of Boubiyan Island (~6). These changes associated with shifts in freshwater discharge from the SAR have adversely affected the hydrographical properties and phytoplankton stock post-2006. The seasonality (and heterogeneity) in hydrography were more pronounced in the low saline period of 2004-2006 than 2007-2008. As evident from multivariate statistical analyses, these changes have generated undesirable effects on the structural property indicators (abundance, biomass, and diversity), and distribution patterns of tintinnids in 2007-2008. Although agglutinated loricates constituted the most dominant group in the 2004-2008 period, the hydrographical changes post-2006 increased the relative abundance of hyalinated loricates. The biotic-abiotic interactions and distance-based linear models (DistLM) revealed that among the measured environmental variables, the cumulative effect of salinity, water temperature, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, silicic acid, and Chl a played a key role regulating microzooplankton community in 2004-2006 (ρ=0.633, P: 0.1%), while a combination of factors silicic acid, salinity, water temperature, and Chl a (ρ=0.422, P: 0.1%) were more important in 2007-2008. All together, species distribution patterns and complementary evidence from biotic-abiotic interactions suggest that the salinity increase post-2006 caused a significant shift in tintinnid community properties with possible repercussions on the functioning of pelagic food-web in the coastal and offshore waters of the NWAG. The present study thus offers prima facie evidence of changes in microbial grazer communities caused by anthropogenic alterations of river discharge into the Arabian Gulf in general and NWAG in particular.","Al-Yamani, F.; Madhusoodhanan, R.; Skryabin, V.; Al-Said, T.",WOS:000483908900014,"Al-Yamani, Faiza, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2019.02.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Kuwait Bay,NULL,Zooplankton,NULL,Anthropogenic impacts; Salinity changes; Multivariate analyses; Shatt Al-Arab ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Assessments of species status are costly and difficult to implement in developing countries with diverse ecosystems due to a lack of species-specific surveys, species-specific data, and other resources. Numerous techniques are devised to determine the threat status of species based on the availability of data and budgetary limits. On this basis, we developed a framework that compared occurrence data of historically exploited reef species in Kenya from existing disparate data sources. Occurrence data from archaeological remains (750-1500CE) was compared with occurrence data of these species catch assessments, and underwater surveys (1991-2014CE). This comparison indicated that only 67 species were exploited over a 750 year period, 750-1500CE, whereas 185 species were landed between 1995 and 2014CE. The first step of our framework identified 23 reef species as threatened with local extinction. The second step of the framework further evaluated the possibility of local extinction with Bayesian extinction analyses using occurrence data from naturalists’ species list with the existing occurrence data sources. The Bayesian extinction analysis reduced the number of reef species threatened with local extinction from 23 to 15. We compared our findings with three methods used for assessing extinction risk. Commonly used extinction risk methods varied in their ability to identify reef species that we identified as threatened with local extinction by our comparative and Bayesian method. For example, 12 of the 15 threatened species that we identified using our framework were listed as either least concern, unevaluated, or data deficient in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list. Piscivores and macro-invertivores were the only functional groups found to be locally extinct. Comparing occurrence data from disparate sources revealed a large number of historically exploited reef species that are possibly locally extinct. Our framework addressed biases such as uncertainty in priors, sightings and survey effort, when estimating the probability of local extinction. Our inexpensive method showed the value and potential for disparate data to fill knowledge gaps that exist in species extinction assessments.","Buckley, S.M.; McClanahan, T.

A minimum of 10 specimens of Diplectanum spp. were sequenced per host species (Argyrosomus regius, Sciaena umbra, Umbrina canariensis and Umbrina cirrosa) and locality (Burriana, Sant Carles de la Ràpita and Santa Pola (Spain)) together with five individuals of the type species Diplectanum aequans. Sequences of partial 28S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of Diplectanum spp. were analysed togetehr with those from other Diplectanidae spp. in GenBank using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods. Population genetic analyses were performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences for a diplectanid species with a wide distribution across host species and localities. Results showed that Diplectanum was not monophyletic, nor were the specimens infecting sciaenids. Instead they formed two separate clades, 26.1-28.6% divergent for the ITS and 13.2-16.9% for the 28S region from D. aequans. Altogether, our results suggest that these specimens represent two distinct new genera from Diplectanum and five putative species with low host specificity. It is likely that morphological variability has led to the description of more species than were detected by molecular methods. In contrast to other monogeneans, Diplectaninae gen. spp. are chiefly generalists. Nonetheless, intraspecific genetic divergence in the ITS region of Diplectaninae gen. spp., and population genetic analyses of one presumed generalist species, Diplectaninae gen. sp. 1.2, showed significant variation between subpopulations living on different hosts. The intraspecific genetic structure by host also suggests different cross-infection potential amongst sciaenid species.","Villar-Torres, M.; Repullés-Albelda, A.; Esteban Montero, F.; Antonio Raga, J.; Blasco-Costa, I.",WOS:000466453400005,"Villar-Torres, Mar, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ijpara.2018.11.003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Diplectanum, ""Sciaenidae""",Phylogeny,NULL,Diplectanids; Molecular systematics; Host-parasite associations; Intraspecific variability,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Nutrient recycling is therefore a key process for ecosystem functioning. Fish recycle nutrients through the excretion of ammonia and phosphate and can influence the abundance and community structure of primary producers such as phytoplankton. However, the effect of fish on other plankton compartments, and whether all fish species have similar effects, is largely unknown. We used a tank experiment to test how 2 Mediterranean fish species, gilthead seabream Sparus aurata and golden mullet Chelon auratus, with distinctly different N and P excretion rates, can affect the abundance and community structure of 3 plankton compartments: phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and microzooplankton. We found that the nutrients released by seabream (whose excreta had an N:P molar ratio greater than the Redfield ratio of 16:1) induced a substantial increase in the abundance of all plankton compartments. In addition, with seabream, the relative abundance of diatoms in the phytoplankton communities increased. However, no significant change was observed with mullet, which had a low excreta N:P molar ratio, suggesting that the growth of microbial plankton was limited by the availability of N. Our results demonstrate that nutrient excretion by fish affects the microbial food web through a species-specific bottom-up effect on the total abundance and community structure of the phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and microzooplankton communities.","Villéger, S.; Fouilland, E.; Argenty, J.; Bouvier, C.; Carré, C.; Bouvier, T.",WOS:000487114000006,"Fouilland, Eric, E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/ame01897,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Bacteria,"Marine fish, ""Phytoplankton""",NULL,Nutrient excretion; Protozooplankton,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Indeed, changes in elemental composition of L. subrugosa shells suggest that exposure to contaminated environments is probably responsible for the alterations detected. Despite the simplicity and lower cost of biometric and morphometric analyzes, these parameters are influenced by natural environmental conditions from which biases may arise.

Macaronesia, an oceanic area located in the Northeast Atlantic, exhibits a high topographic and oceanographic complexity that enables a rich biodiversity. So far, seven species of baleen whales have been recorded in the area. These are migratory animals that travel long distances between feeding grounds at high latitudes in summer and tropical areas for mating and breeding in winter. As baleen whales are such mobile animals, the conservation and management of their habitat is highly challenging. Hence, knowing and understanding the patterns of their distribution is fundamental. Despite the many records of baleen whales in Macaronesia, heterogeneity in research effort has resulted in scattered occurrence data that leads to an incomplete picture of their distribution in the area. 2. We aim to increase knowledge of distribution patterns of baleen whales, and identify research effort gaps in Macaronesia. 3. From a total of 14 peer‐reviewed publications, four public reports, two poster presentations, and four data bases, we gathered 1798 records in Macaronesia since 1990 for four species of baleen whale: minke whale <i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>, fin whale <i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>, blue whale <i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>, and humpback whale <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>. Spatio‐temporal descriptive analyses and ecological modelling were carried out in order to understand occurrence patterns. 4. The results show a big lack of research effort and occurrence data in offshore areas and in some coastal waters, namely off the West African coast. Moreover, blue, fin, and humpback whales are sighted mainly in spring in the north of Macaronesia, while minke whale distribution is clearly different: they have a stronger presence in summer. This study highlights areas in urgent need of research effort in order to inform decision‐makers and support effective measures for the protection and conservation of baleen whales in Macaronesia.","Valente, R.; Correia, A.M.; Gil, A.; González García, L.; Sousa Pinto, I.",WOS:000460945200004,"Valente, Raul, R.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/mam.12148,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This suggests that different cost-benefit trade-offs may underlie individual variation in foraging specialization. Indeed, while specialization may improve foraging efficiency by a better knowledge of the spatio-temporal availability of resources, individuals may also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in these resources. In this study, we used multiyear GPS tracking data of 19 Herring Gulls (<em>Larus argentatus</em>) breeding along the Belgian coast to assess whether foraging effort and reproductive success varied among different levels of foraging specialization. First, we quantified spatial and habitat specialization during incubation and chick rearing for 31 individual breeding cycles during which birds raised young until the age of 21 days. Next, we tested whether spatial and habitat specialization were related to the daily distance covered (as a proxy for foraging effort), and to chick growth (as a proxy for reproductive success). We found that birds primarily varied in their extent of habitat specialization. Habitat specialization was associated with reduced daily distances covered and increased offspring growth rates, in particular the growth rate of the youngest chicks. Yet, positive effects of habitat specialization on chick growth decreased at high levels of spatial specialization. Our results thus demonstrate fitness benefits of foraging specialization during our 5-year study period, but also highlight the need for longer-term studies as environmental changes may cause benefits to vary throughout a lifetime.","van den Bosch, M.; Baert, J.M.; Müller, W.; Lens, L.; Stienen, E.",WOS:000473761300029,"Baert, Jan, J.M.","Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC), Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/beheco/arz016,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Notwithstanding, these environments are also prone to contamination, excessive organic enrichment and hypoxic/anoxic events due to the synergy between natural (e.g. fluctuations of oxygen, temperature and salinity) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. accumulation of pollutants carried by the river). In order to minimize any economic loss and potential risk for human health, river lagoons are kept under surveillance by means of monitoring campaigns that rarely include foraminifera and nematoda despite their suitability as ecological indicators. In May 2016, these two assemblages were investigated within the framework of the project RITMARE in four lagoons of the Po Delta system (Adriatic Sea) in terms of taxonomic composition, biodiversity and biological traits. Dominated by a few tolerant taxa (<i>Ammonia tepida</i> and <i>Haynesina germanica</i> for foraminifera; <i>Daptonema, Tershellingia</i> and <i>Sabatieria</i> for nematoda), both assemblages seemed adapted to conditions of environmental instability mainly ascribable to natural disturbance factors rather than to anthropogenic contamination, as indicated by the DISTLM outputs. Furthermore, the stochastic occurrence of abnormal tests and the presence of numerous organisms in subsurface sediment levels confirmed a limited effect of synthetic organic compounds (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and trace metals on foraminifera. Focusing on nematoda, the assemblage seemed more sensitive in reflecting the peculiar environmental conditions of each lagoon and the degree of confinement, as indicated by the significant intra- and inter-lagoon variability detected for the majority of the tested metrics. In particular the significantly less biodiverse assemblage dominated by r-strategist (i.e. pioneer) organisms at the inner and middle stations of Scardovari may represent the nematoda response to recent hypoxic/anoxic conditions that often occur in the inner areas of this lagoon because of its low water renewal. Both assemblages showed to be suitable for the implementation of monitoring programs; from the study of foraminifera, a relatively low chemical contamination was inferred while, from that of nematodes, recent events of oxygen deficiency were detectable.","Franzo, A.; Asioli, A.; Roscioli, C.; Patrolecco, L.; Bazzaro, M.; Del Negro, P.; Cibic, T.",WOS:000464488000009,"Franzo, Annalisa, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.039,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Foraminifera, ""Nematoda""",NULL,NULL,River lagoon; Foraminifera; Nematoda; Contamination; Hypoxia; Monitoring,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Large snails show no difference in fitness across altitude, but their previous migration history dictates their high-altitude placement in watersheds. The factors determining the rate of migration have not yet been studied. In this study, we sought to understand how migration rate changes with shell size and altitude. We used mark–recapture to track individual snails across seven sites of varying altitude in a single watershed on Dominica and measured the shell length of randomly collected snails at sites. Volunteers were assisted with data collection in both cases. Shell length was positively correlated with distance from river mouth, although smaller snails were more frequently found at high altitude, high flow sites. Snails closer to the river mouth had faster upstream migration rates than those at mid-altitude. While we found large snails at higher altitude sites, there was no significant relationship between migration rate and shell size. Our findings suggest that large snails do not migrate at maximal rates allowed by energy stores. We also observed erosion of the outer shell periostracum and calcium carbonate underneath, which was seen significantly more often on larger shells. We hypothesise that this erosion is a product of exposure of the structural calcium carbonate to low alkalinity in Dominican streams, following an initial chipping of the periostracum.","Villeneuve, A.R.; Thornhill, I.; Eales, J.",WOS:000467538000005,"Villeneuve, Andrew, A.R.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10452-019-09683-7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Gastropoda, ""Neritidae""",NULL,NULL,Amphidromy; Citizen science; Dominica; Gastropod; Neritidae; Upstream migration ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Moreover, sea level changes and antecedent geology can also play an important role in defining depositional patterns for the shelf-slope system. This work investigates contrasting depositional and geomorphological patterns in the Abrolhos shelf-slope system, eastern Brazilian margin, South Atlantic. We have combined existing bathymetric datasets with bottom imagery and samples collected at the Johnson-Sea-Link manned submersible along two Abrolhos slope sites, which are separated by almost 2° of latitude. Our dataset includes seafloor sediments, single-beam echosounder, and 20 h of video recording. Dives ranged from 90 to 620 m water depth. Results showed that the north and south Abrolhos shelf-slope systems are distinct in terms of their morphology and sedimentology. The depositional pattern in the northern upper slope is typically carbonate dominated, with the occurrence of carbonate mounds around 500 m deep, small biogenic structures around 200 m deep, interspersed with wackstones and packstones. The upper slope is characterized by a steep limestone wall at 120 m deep that resembles a shelf-edge reef, followed by extensive rhodolith beds at the shelf edge and outer shelf. The southern upper slope shows a sigmoidal profile with a gentle gradient. Mixed siliciclastic–carbonate fine sedimentation dominates from 300 to 700 m deep. On the upper slope, fine carbonate sedimentation predominates, and a biogenic reef structure is observed in a water depth around 120–130 m. The shelf edge and outer shelf are also characterized by extensive rhodolith beds. Main findings indicate that a volcanic rock complex is an important antecedent geology that may influence the setting up of distinct sedimentary regimes and sediment input to the slope. The geometry of the antecedent geology controls the paleotopography forming a gradient towards the south. This, combined with sea-level changes and Rio Doce riverine sediment input, can explain the contrasts between the northern and southern shelf-upper slope depositional settings.

AAR dating of the shell bed and four Last Interglacial (LIG) beach deposits at Moyjil and Goose Lagoon, 30 km to the west, confirmed a LIG age.

Shell deposition following the LIG sea-level maximum at 120–125 ka is consistent with stratigraphic evidence. A sand layer immediately below the shell deposit gave an age of ~240 ka (i.e. MIS 7) and appears to have been a source of older sand incorporated into the shell deposit. Younger ages (~60–80 ka) are due to bioturbation before calcrete finally sealed the deposit.

This study aims to integrate historical biological data collected during “red tide” events along the Ecuadorian coast between 1997 and 2017 in relation to five ocean variables derived from satellite remote sensing data to explain the seasonal drivers of coastal processes associated with HABs dynamics. Seasonality of the occurrence of HABs was assessed in relation to oceanographic variables by applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to the Ecuadorian central coast (Zone 1) and at the outer and inner Gulf of Guayaquil (Zone 2). Sixty-seven HABs events were registered between 1997 and 2017. From a total of 40 species of phytoplankton identified, 28 were identified as non-toxic and the remaining 12 are well known to produce toxins. Dinoflagellates were the taxonomic group most highly associated with potential HABs events along the entire Ecuadorian coast. HABs appear to be constrained by the Humboldt coastal upwelling, high precipitation, and associated coastal runoff, with higher biomass abundance in the Gulf of Guayaquil than in the central coast. Results from the MCA reveal that in the central Ecuadorian coast (oligotrophic system), toxic HABs occurred with low abundance of dinoflagellates, while in the Gulf of Guayaquil (eutrophic system), toxic HABs corresponded to a high abundance of dinoflagellates. In both cases, high values were found for sea surface temperature, precipitation, and irradiance—characteristic of wet seasons or El Niño years. Non-toxic HABs occurred with a high abundance of dinoflagellates, ciliates, and centric diatoms, corresponding to colder waters and low levels of precipitation and irradiance. These findings confirm that dinoflagellates display several strategies that enhance their productive capacity when ocean conditions are warmer, allowing them to produce toxins at high or at low concentrations. Considering that the Gulf of Guayaquil is essential to tourism, the shrimp industry, fisheries, and international shipping, these findings strongly suggest the need to establish an ecosystem health research program to monitor HABs and the development of a preventive policy for tourism and public health in Ecuador.","Borbor-Cordova, M.J.; Torres, G.; Mantilla-Saltos, G.; Casierra-Tomala, A.; Bermúdez, J.R.; Renteria, W.; Bayot, B.",WOS:000462669000001,"Borbor-Cordova, Mercy, M.J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00013,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Guayaquil Gulf,NULL,"Dinoflagellates, ""Remote sensing"", ""Upwelling""",NULL,phytoplankton taxonomic groups (PTG); Humboldt Current,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This article focuses on the interplay among human-nonhuman relations, knowledge production, and the politics of endangerment. Advancing a historical ontology of endangerment, it highlights the role of transforming the nonhuman world in the coming to be of new objects of environmental knowledge. Such knowledge can provide the basis for credible claims of endangerment, facilitating mobilizations against the very human-nonhuman relations that produced it. An in-depth case study of the delta smelt, an endangered species of fish caught in the center of California’s “water wars,” shows how changes in the instrumentalization of the nonhuman environment can produce new knowledge of nature that allows actors to make claims and form coalitions that would be otherwise inconceivable. Because its sole habitat is the hub of California’s water delivery system, efforts to save the species from extinction have reduced flows to farms and cities, fomenting conflict between environmentalists and water users. This article demonstrates that the taxonomic classification of the delta smelt as a species and evidence of its decline arose directly from the reengineering of California’s rivers for extractive ends. Ironically, the knowledge on which environmental advocates relied was a product of the instrumental relation to nature that they sought to transform.","Scoville, C.",WOS:000457004400001,"Scoville, Caleb, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11186-019-09339-3,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Endangered species,NULL,Biological classification; California water; Environmental politics; Human-nonhuman relations; Taxonomic science   ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, there is a paucity of research regarding temporal change in the biological composition of these CWC habitats and analysis of this change is critical, especially considering the anthropogenic influences impacting upon these vital habitats. This study is the first to analyse temporal biological change on a CWC mound at a small temporal (4 years) and large spatial (entire mound) scale. Video datasets were collected over the Piddington Mound of the Moira Mounds, Porcupine Seabight, offshore Ireland, in 2011 and 2015. 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats were placed on 510 screenshots from each year (1020 total). Species were identified and quantified. CTD data were also analysed to investigate potential contributory causes of change. There was a highly significant (P < 0.01) decline in average <i>M. oculata</i> percentage cover from 2011 (1.37 ± 3.79%) to 2015 (0.70 ± 2.76%); however, there was not a significant change (P = 0.74) in average <i>L. pertusa</i> percentage cover in 2011 (2.33 ± 7.52%) when comparing it with 2015 (5.28 ± 7.88%). Additionally, there was an increase in average percentage cover of two poriferan species, <i>Aphrocallistes</i> sp. and <i>Hexadella</i> sp., from 2011 (1.18 ± 2.35%; 0.21 ± 0.42%, respectively) to 2015 (2.15 ± 3.48%; 0.33 ± 0.55%, respectively) (P < 0.01 for both species). Shannon-Weiner and Pielou's Species Evenness diversity indices were generally higher in 2011 than in 2015. This overall decline in diversity and increase in poriferan abundances is attributed to the decline in <i>M. oculata</i>, which may have been influenced by altered environmental conditions in 2015, as indicated by the CTD data. Moreover, differing biological and ecological responses of <i>L. pertusa</i> and <i>M. oculata</i> to environmental changes were considered and discussed as possible contributors to the results observed for these two species. If <i>M. oculata</i> percentage cover declines linearly at the current rate (approximately 0.17% per year, if a constant decline in each of the four years), then by 2019, this species may be nearly absent from the Piddington Mound, which would have major effects on species’ abundances, distributions, and biodiversity. Therefore, further research and continuous monitoring of the temporal change in biological composition within CWC reef/mound habitats are critical.","Boolukos, C.M.; Lim, A.; O'Riordan, R.M.; Wheeler, A.J.",WOS:000467664600004,"O'Riordan, Ruth, R.M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2019.03.004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In contrast, secondary shell openings are rare in snails and are largely limited to slit shells, keyhole limpets, and abalone of the Vetigastropoda. When such features occur in other groups, they are noteworthy and raise interesting questions concerning the functional/adaptive significance of these shell modifications. Here we report on one such modification in a newly described species of vermetid snail. Members of the worm-snail family Vermetidae are sessile, suspension-feeding caenogastropods found in warm temperate to tropical marine environments worldwide. As juveniles, vermetids permanently cement their shells to hard substrata and subsequently produce irregularly coiled polychaete-like shell tubes with indeterminate growth and typically a simple circular shell aperture. In one previously studied group (genus <i>Cupolaconcha</i>), the aperture can be covered by a shell dome with a central slit that retains its widest opening in the center of the aperture. Vermetid specimens collected in the barrier reefs of Belize and the Florida Keys show an extreme aperture modification previously unknown in Gastropoda, in which the shell opening is covered by an apertural dome that leaves two equal-sized circular holes, each corresponding to the inflow and outflow water exchange currents of the animal’s mantle cavity. The function of this perforated apertural dome is unknown, and it is in some ways antithetical to the suspension feeding habit of these snails. Further field and laboratory-based studies will be needed to clarify the functional significance and trade-offs of this unique morphology. The new taxon, which is not closely related to the previously described dome-building clade <i>Cupolaconcha</i>, is described and named as <i>Vermetus biperforatus</i> Bieler, Collins, Golding &amp; Rawlings n. sp.","Bieler, R.; Collins, T.M.; Golding, R.; Rawlings, T.A.",WOS:000460030200016,"Collins, Timothy, T.M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.6569,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Interlocking efforts bring together international partnerships and networks, national, regional and institutional projects and investments and countless individual contributors, spanning diverse biological and environmental research domains, government agencies and non-governmental organisations, citizen science and commercial enterprise. However, current efforts remain inefficient and inadequate to address the global need for accurate data on the world's species and on changing patterns and trends in biodiversity. Significant challenges include imbalances in regional engagement in biodiversity informatics activity, uneven progress in data mobilisation and sharing, the lack of stable persistent identifiers for data records, redundant and incompatible processes for cleaning and interpreting data and the absence of functional mechanisms for knowledgeable experts to curate and improve data.Recognising the need for greater alignment between efforts at all scales, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) convened the second Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) in July 2018 to propose a coordination mechanism for developing shared roadmaps for biodiversity informatics. GBIC2 attendees reached consensus on the need for a global alliance for biodiversity knowledge, learning from examples such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the open software communities under the Apache Software Foundation. These initiatives provide models for multiple stakeholders with decentralised funding and independent governance to combine resources and develop sustainable solutions that address common needs.This paper summarises the GBIC2 discussions and presents a set of 23 complementary ambitions to be addressed by the global community in the context of the proposed alliance.

Overall, the antifouling treatments were effective in decreasing the diversity of fouling communities and spatial variability across marinas was observed. Increasing exposure to metal pollutants decreases both species cover and total diversity, independently of their native or NIS condition. However, evidences found suggest that long-term effects of copper based antifouling coatings can be modulated by metal-resistant species allowing a secondary substrate for the epibiosis of other species to establish.","Ramalhosa, P.; Gestoso, I.; Duarte, B.; Caçador, I.; Canning-Clode, J.",WOS:000465509700043,"Caçador, Isabel, I.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.072,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Evolvability, or the intrinsic capacity of lineages for evolutionary change, is thought to influence disparities in species diversity across taxa. Over macroevolutionary time scales, clades that exhibit high evolvability are expected to have higher speciation rates. Cone snails (family: Conidae, >900 spp.) provide a unique opportunity to test this prediction because their toxin genes can be used to characterize differences in evolvability between clades. Cone snails are carnivorous, use prey-specific venom (conotoxins) to capture prey, and the genes that encode venom are known and diversify through gene duplication. Theory predicts that higher gene diversity confers a greater potential to generate novel phenotypes for specialization and adaptation. Therefore, if conotoxin gene diversity gives rise to varying levels of evolvability, conotoxin gene diversity should be coupled with macroevolutionary speciation rates. We applied exon capture techniques to recover phylogenetic markers and conotoxin loci across 314 species, the largest venom discovery effort in a single study. We paired a reconstructed timetree using 12 fossil calibrations with species-specific estimates of conotoxin gene diversity and used trait-dependent diversification methods to test the impact of evolvability on diversification patterns. Surprisingly, we did not detect any signal for the relationship between conotoxin gene diversity and speciation rates, suggesting that venom evolution may not be the rate-limiting factor controlling diversification dynamics in Conidae. Comparative analyses showed some signal for the impact of diet and larval dispersal strategy on diversification patterns, though detection of a signal depended on the dataset and the method. If our results remain true with increased taxonomic sampling in future studies, they suggest that the rapid evolution of conid venom may cause other factors to become more critical to diversification, such as ecological opportunity or traits that promote isolation among lineages.","Phuong, M.A.; Alfaro, M.E.; Mahardika, G.N.; Marwoto, R.M.; Prabowo, R.E.; von Rintelen, T.; Vogt, P.W.H.; Hendricks, J.R.; Puillandre, N.",WOS:000489700900008,"Phuong, Mark, M.A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/sysbio/syz016,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, we investigated whether reputable concepts in deep-sea ecology also explain diversity and distribution patterns of nematode genera and species in the abyss. Among them, three paradigms were tackled: (1) the deep sea is a highly diverse environment at a local scale, while on a regional and even larger geographical scale, species and genus turnover is limited; (2) the biodiversity of deep-sea nematode communities changes with the nature and amount of organic matter input from the surface; and (3) patch-mosaic dynamics of the deep-sea environment drive local diversity. To test these hypotheses, diversity and density of nematode assemblages and of species of the genus <i>Acantholaimus</i< were studied along two abyssal E-W transects. These two transects were situated in the Southern Ocean (~50°S) and the North Atlantic (~10°N). Four different hierarchical scales were used to compare biodiversity: at the scale of cores, between stations from the same region, and between regions. Results revealed that the deep sea harbours a high diversity at a local scale (alpha diversity), but that turnover can be shaped by different environmental drivers. Therefore, these results question the second part of the paradigm about limited species turnover in the deep sea. Higher surface primary productivity was correlated with greater nematode densities, whereas diversity responses to the augmentation of surface productivity showed no trend. Areas subjected to a constant and low food input revealed similar nematode communities to other oligotrophic abyssal areas, while stations under high productivity were characterized by different dominant genera and <i>Acantholaimus</i> species, and by a generally low local diversity. Our results corroborate the species-energy hypothesis, where productivity can set a limit to the richness of an ecosystem. Finally, we observed no correlation between sediment variability and local diversity. Although differences in sediment variability were significant across stations, these had to be considered without effect on the nematode community structure in the studied abyssal areas.","Lins, L.; da Silva, M.C.; Neres, P.; Esteves, A.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000432762700014,"Neres, Patrícia, P.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.12.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Acantholaimus,NULL,NULL,Alpha diversity; Patchiness; Diversity indices; Spatial scale,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the latter chapter the history of their systematic is reviewed giving an almost complete picture of systematic-scientific progress especially in the past years which changed our view on annelid phylogeny dramatically. The most basal annelids, lately united as Palaeoannelida, represent two families of aberrant polychaetes formerly often suggested to be highly derived which now give us a fresh look on how the ancestral annelid may have looked like. These lack certain key characters such as nuchal organs and possess rather simple nervous systems which now likely represent primitive character states. In this basal radiation the first taxon of apparently unsegmented and achaetigerous animals is positioned, the Sipuncula. Most likely another group of platyhelminth-like and unsegmented and even chaeta-lees annelids, Lobatocerebridae falls into this basal radiation. The section of Sedentaria starts with Orbiniida, a taxon characterized by elongated, thread-like worms which do not have anterior appendages like palps and comprises several families representing members of the Meiofauna. These minute worms often inhabiting the interstitial spaces in marine sands are suggested to have evolved by progenesis. The second higher taxon is represented by Cirratuliformia comprising nine families of typical sedentary polychaetes each of which showing a remarkable variation of the annelid body plan. Members of this taxon usually exhibit many annelid characters but certain also lack the most typical prostomial appendages, the palps.","Purschke, G.; Westheide, W.; Böggemann, M.

Here, we use phylogenomics to address deep relationships between the five major gastropod lineages— Caenogastropoda, Heterobranchia, Neritimorpha, Patellogastropoda and Vetigastropoda—and provide one congruent and well-supported topology. We substantially expand taxon sampling for outgroups and for previously underrepresented gastropod lineages, presenting new transcriptomes for neritimorphs and patellogastropods. We conduct analyses under maximum- likelihood, Bayesian inference and a coalescent-based approach, accounting for the most pervasive sources of systematic errors in large datasets: compositional heterogeneity, site heterogeneity, heterotachy, variation in evolutionary rates among genes, matrix completeness, outgroup choice and gene tree conflict. We find that vetigastropods and patellogastropods are sister taxa, and that neritimorphs are the sister group to caenogastropods and heterobranchs. We name these two major unranked clades Psilogastropoda and Angiogastropoda, respectively. We additionally provide the first genomic-scale data for internal relationships of neritimorphs and patellogastropods.

This paper reviews the application of molecular approaches to understanding copepod physiology, particularly in non-parasitic species. The review includes both targeted gene approaches and untargeted transcriptomic approaches, with suggestions for best practices in each case. Issues particularly relevant to studies of copepods include heterogeneity within species, morphologically cryptic species, experimental artifacts associated with sample handling, and limited annotation of copepod genes and transcripts. The emergence of high-throughput sequencing and associated increased availability of genomic and transcriptomic databases have presented a huge opportunity to advance knowledge of copepod physiology.

Sea ice cover limits light, and hence primary production and food supply. Plankton, carried by currents from open water to areas under the sea ice, provides a transitory food resource that is spatially and temporally variable. We recorded epifaunal abundances at 17 sites in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, over 12 yr, and found differences in communities based on location and time. The differences in location support patterns observed in long-term infaunal studies, which are primarily driven by currents, food availability, and larval supply. The temporal differences, highlighting 2004 and 2009 as years of change, match the altered persistence of sea ice in the region, caused by the appearance and disappearance of mega-icebergs. The temporal changes were driven by changes in abundance of species that filter feed on large particulates. The shift in current patterns that occurred due to mega-icebergs decreased the normal food supply in the region. In addition to the decrease in food availability, we suggest that the reduced light resulting from thicker-than-normal sea ice resulted in a shift to smaller phytoplankton. A change in food quality as well as quantity may have influenced the temporal change in epifaunal communities.","Kim, S.; Hammerstrom, K.K.; Dayton, P.K.",WOS:000464519600001,"Hammerstrom, Kamille, K.K.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12899,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Long-term; Decadal; Benthic; Megafauna,Journal article,NULL,NULL

They usually show an increase in species richness in the offshore direction, coinciding with decreasing terrigenous impact and a deeper seafloor. These two conditions usually concur, which makes it less easy to distinguish how each of them influences coral diversity separately. Since reefs off Jakarta (in the Thousand Islands archipelago) are arranged in an 80 km long string perpendicular to the coastline in south-to-north direction, with a maximum shelf depth halfway along (instead of at the end of) the string, this archipelago is very suitable for studies on inshore–offshore gradients. In the present study, mushroom corals (Fungiidae; n = 31) were used to examine diversity patterns on 38 reef sites along such a gradient, involving species richness over their entire depth range from reef flat to reef base (2–30 m) and separately at shallow depths (2–6 m). Total species diversity was highest in the central part of the archipelago, with unique species occurring in deep habitats. Diversity at shallow depths was only slightly higher here than at reefs located more nearshore and offshore, which both had less clear water. Therefore, shelf depth and distance from the mainland can be considered separate determinants of coral diversity off Jakarta.","Hoeksema, B.W.; Giyanto; Suharsono",WOS:000464380200002,"Hoeksema, Bert, B.W.","Netherlands Ctr Biodivers Naturalis, Dept Marine Zool, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d11030046,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","Indonesia, ""Java Sea""","Fungiidae, ""Scleractinia""",Latitude,NULL,mega city; river outlets; water transparency; blast fishing ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Based on several summer surveys (July to September 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) in the Bering Sea, we used biological trait analysis (BTA) to quantify the composition and diversity of macrobenthic biological traits along an environmental gradient ranging from the shallowest portion of the continental shelf to the shelf break and deep basin. Our results show a clear shift in the macrobenthic functional composition through the application of abundance- and biomass-based measurements in six different subregions of the Bering Sea. The macrobenthic community of the south-western shelf and shelf break of the Bering Sea, an area with silty-sand sediment, was mainly composed of taxa characterized by high body flexibility, vermiform, and tube-dweller/burrower modalities or large, semi-motile, deposit feeder and flattened dorsally modalities. However, the community of the north-eastern shelf of the Bering Sea with sandy sediment was mainly characterized by organisms characterized as motile surface crawlers and carnivores/scavengers. Similar to the factors that determine the taxonomic distribution and composition of the macrobenthos, sediment composition and depth were found to be the main factors that affect the distribution of the macrobenthic functional structure in the study area. The species and functional diversity of the macrobenthos show a strong linear relationship, potentially indicating that the community exhibits relatively low functional redundancy and that the benthic ecosystem is vulnerable to species loss or regime shifts.","Liu, K.; Lin, H.; He, X.; Huang, Y.; Li, Z.; Lin, J.; Mou, J.; Zhang, S.; Lin, L.; Wang, J.; Sun, J.",WOS:000470964500067,"Sun, Jun, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.029,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Macrobenthos,NULL,Functional diversity; Biological trait analysis; Environmental gradients; Bering Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, this area with a typically micro-tidal range is subject to intensive anthropogenic pressures: soft bottom trawling, chemical pollution from phosphoric acid production, and shipping activity. The present study is the first investigation of the structure of the benthic macrofauna on this part of the Tunisian coast. In April 2010, 28 stations were sampled along four transects from the phosphogypsum outfall on an inshore-offshore gradient. A total of 239 macrobenthos taxa, belonging to nine zoological groups and 140 families, were identified with a dominance of polychaetes (33.5%), crustaceans (29.4%), and mollusks (19.6%). Results show that the stations facing the phosphogypsum discharges are the most disturbed and characterized by a poorly diversified macrofauna. The macrofauna is dominated by carnivores, suspension feeders, and selective deposit feeders, and seems to be linked more to the availability of trophic resources than to disturbance. Four benthic assemblages are identified using Cluster and MDS analyses linked to edaphic factors, such as sediment structure, organic matter content, inshore/offshore gradient, and the proximity of the phosphogypsum outfall. The biotic indices (AMBI and BO2A) calculated from macrofauna data show that the ecological status of Skhira Bay varies overall from moderate to good. This study suggests initiating a long-term monitoring program to improve our understanding of the temporal changes of this ecosystem, to recommend the necessary conservation measures in this area of high-value natural heritage.","Boudaya, L.; Mosbahi, N.; Dauvin, J.C.; Neifar, L.",WOS:000465460000076,"Boudaya, Lobna, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11356-019-04809-8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Skhira Bay; Benthic macrofauna; Anthropogenic pressures; Trophic groups ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

At the latitudinal region with the highest ratio, in south-eastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial species dominate the space on artificial plates in two independent studies of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of colonial vs. solitary ascidians. Eight ascidian species were subjected to a predation treatment, i.e. caged vs. exposed to predators, and a competition treatment, i.e. leaving vs. removing competitors, to assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species, whereas competition did not show consistent patterns between the two life histories. We hypothesize that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges.

A large proportion of these organisms are constitutive mixotrophs (CMs), with an innate ability to photosynthesize. Here, for the first time, an analysis is presented of the biogeography of CMs across the oceans.LocationGlobal marine ecosystems.Time period1970–2018.Major taxa studiedMarine planktonic protists.MethodsRecords for CM species, primarily from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), were grouped by taxonomy and size to evaluate sampling efforts across Longhurst's oceanic provinces. Biases were evaluated through nonparametric tests and multivariate analysis. Biogeographies of CMs from OBIS data were compared with data from studies that specifically targeted these organisms.ResultsConstitutive mixotrophs of different taxonomic groups, across all size ranges, are ubiquitous. However, strong database biases were detected with respect to organism size, taxonomic groups and region. A strong bias was seen towards dinophytes. Species < 20 µm, especially non‐dinophytes, were least represented, with their recorded distribution limited to coastal regions and to temperate and polar seas. Studies specifically targeting these organisms revealed their distribution to be much wider. Such biases are likely to have occurred owing to a failure to capture and correctly identify these organisms in routine sampling protocols.Main conclusionsConstitutive mixotrophs are dominant members of organisms traditionally termed “phytoplankton”. However, lack of routine protocols for measuring phagotrophy in “phytoplankton” protists has led to widespread misrepresentation of the fundamental nature of marine planktonic primary producers; most express both “animal‐like” and “plant‐like” nutrition. Our results have implications for studies of the global biogeography of plankton, of food web dynamics (including models) and of biogeochemical cycling in the oceans.","Leles, S.G.; Mitra, A.; Flynn, K.J.; Tillmann, U.; Stoecker, D.; Jeong, H.J.; Burkholder, J.; Hansen, P.J.; Caron, D.A.; Glibert, P.M.; Hallegraeff, G.; Raven, J.A.; Sanders, R.W.; Zubkov, M.",WOS:000460419900001,"Leles, Suzana, S.G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12853,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Forty-eight stations were sampled in discrete-depth fashion, including epi- (0–200 m), meso- (200–800/1000 m), upper bathy- (800/1000–1500 m), and lower bathypelagic (1500–3000 m) strata. We compared samples collected from the same area on the same night using obliquely towed trawls and large vertically towed nets and found that shrimp catches from the latter were significantly higher. This suggests that vertical nets are more efficient for biomass assessments, and we report these values here. We further compared day and night samples from the same site and found that biomass estimates differed only in the epi- and mesopelagic strata, while estimates from the bathypelagic strata and the total water column were independent of time of day. Maximal shrimp standing stocks occurred in the upper bathypelagic (52–54% of total biomass) and in the mesopelagic (42–43%). We assessed shrimp biomass in three major regions of the Atlantic between 40°N and 40°S, and the first-order extrapolation of these data suggests that the global low-latitude deep-pelagic shrimp biomass (1700 million tons) may lie within the range reported for mesopelagic fishes (estimations between 1000 and 15000 million tons). These data, along with previous fish-biomass estimates, call for the reassessment of the quantity and distribution of nektonic carbon in the deep ocean.","Vereshchaka, A.L.; Lunina, A.A.; Sutton, T.",WOS:000464094200053,"Sutton, Tracey, T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-42472-8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

While formally described eukaryotic diversity still falls short of estimated eukaryotic species diversity by many hundreds of thousands of species, some recent accounts have suggested a growing number of taxonomists are within reach of describing all extant species. We present a case study that illustrates, to the contrary, a recent ‘taxonomic impediment’ in part attributable to derogation of taxonomy as a scientific discipline: contemporary practice has re-interpreted taxonomy largely as an endeavour in enumerating species. We argue that challenges lie in (1) a poor understanding of taxonomy's epistemology; (2) excessive displacement of interest toward ecological or molecular studies; (3) over-interpretation of the contributions of multiple authors describing a species; and (4) perspectives that are strongly influenced by well-known taxa. The historical and recent literature on scyphozoans reveal ghosts of taxonomy's past that persist in the present, but suggest also that a renaissance enabled by integrative taxonomy is possible in the (near) future.","Gómez-Daglio, L.; Dawson, M.N.",WOS:000482975700001,"Gómez-Daglio, Liza, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315419000201,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Yet the compilation of huge volumes of data remains a labour-intensive impediment to a more complete understanding of Earth’s biodiversity history. Even so, many occurrence records of species and genera in these taxa can be uncovered in the palaeontological literature. Here, we extract observations of fossils and their inferred ages from unstructured text in books and scientific articles using machine-learning approaches. We use Bryozoa, a group of marine invertebrates with a rich fossil record, as a case study. Building on recent advances in computational linguistics, we develop a pipeline to recognize taxonomic names and geologic time intervals in published literature and use supervised learning to machine-read whether the species in question occurred in a given age interval. Intermediate machine error rates appear comparable to human error rates in a simple trial, and resulting genus richness curves capture the main features of published fossil diversity studies of bryozoans. We believe our automated pipeline, that greatly reduced the time required to compile our dataset, can help others compile similar data for other taxa.","Kopperud, B.T.; Lidgard, S.; Liow, L.H.",WOS:000465657800007,"Liow, Lee Hsiang, L.H.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rspb.2019.0022,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Bryozoa,NULL,NULL,cheilostome bryozoans; fossil occurrences; palaeobiodiversity; natural language processing; information extraction; literature compilation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the present study, we reviewed available data in the World Register of Marine Species, and found that 11,456 valid species of Recent polychaetes (1417 genera, 85 families) have been named by 835 first authors since 1758. Over this period, three discovery phases of the fauna were identified. That is, the initial phase (from 1758 to mid-nineteenth century) where nearly 500 species were described by few taxonomists, the second phase (from the 1850’s to mid-twentieth century) where almost 5000 species were largely described by some very productive taxonomists, and the third phase (from the 1950’s to modern times) in which about 6000 species were described by the most taxonomists ever. Six polychaete families with the most species were Syllidae (993 species), Polynoidae (876 species), Nereididae (687 species), Spionidae (612 species), Terebellidae (607 species) and Serpulidae (576 species). The increase in the number of first authors through time indicated greater taxonomic effort. By contrast, there was a decline in the number of polychaete species described in proportion to the number of first authors since around mid-nineteenth century. This suggested that it has been getting more difficult to find new polychaete species. According to our modelling, we predict that 5200 more species will be discovered between now and the year 2100. The total number of polychaete species of the world by the end of this century is thus anticipated to be about 16,700 species.","Pamungkas, J.; Glasby, C.J.; Read, G.B.; Wilson, S.P.; Costello, M.",WOS:000466952400001,"Pamungkas, Joko, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s10152-019-0524-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Echiura, ""Pogonophora"", ""Polychaeta"", ""Vestimentifera""","Biodiversity, ""Marine"", ""Taxonomy""",NULL,Species discovery rate,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Freshwater mollusks are also arguably the most endangered fauna on the planet. Yet few references exist for researchers, shell enthusiasts, and general readers who are interested in learning more about these fascinating creatures. In Freshwater Mollusks of the World, Charles Lydeard and Kevin S. Cummings fill that void with contributions from dozens of renowned mollusk experts. Touching on 34 families of freshwater gastropods (snails) and 9 families of freshwater bivalves (mussels and clams), each chapter provides a synthesis of the latest research on the diversity and evolutionary relationships of the family. The book also includes• a look at how evolving DNA sequencing data techniques help shed light on mollusk taxonomy• distribution maps of each family's biogeographic locales• a representative photo and distribution map for each of the freshwater mollusk families • the latest information on each family's conservation status—and how to reverse the habitat destruction, modification, and pollution that threatens it• a discussion of the ecological and economic damages caused by invasive mollusk species, as well as their role as disease vectorsMollusks provide us with amazing biogeographical insights: their ancient fossil record goes back over 500 million years, and their distribution patterns are a reflection of past continental and climate changes. The only comprehensive summary of systematic and biodiversity information on freshwater mollusk families throughout the world, this reference is a must for malacologists, limnologists, ichthyologists, stream ecologists, biogeographers, and conservation biologists.","Lydeard, C.; Cummings, K.S.",NULL,"Lydeard, Charles, C.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Bivalvia, ""Gastropoda""","Conchology, ""Freshwater molluscs"", ""Malacology""",NULL,stream ecology; bivalves; gastropods,Book/Monograph,NULL,NULL

These sites, while close to each other geographically, were characterized by differences in exposure to waves and influence from oceanic water, and arranged in a gradient from semi-offshore through intermediate exposure to a more sheltered fjord with a stronger influence from freshwater run-off. The effect on kelp biomass and biofouling was studied from February to August in 2014. Large variation in biofouling cover was observed between sites. The site with highest exposure had the maximum kelp biomass, but also the highest cover of fouling organisms. The frond area covered by epibionts varied by a factor of 8 with lowest cover at the fjord site, intermediate cover at the inshore site and highest cover at the semi-offshore site. Species composition of the biofouling community also varied between sites, with the dominant taxa being hydroids at the most protected, and bryozoans at the most exposed site. The present study shows that both biomass yield and biofouling can vary profoundly within short geographical ranges and it thereby underlines the importance of thorough site selection for kelp cultivation in order to achieve maximum kelp biomass and minimum biofouling. It also reveals promising opportunities for kelp cultivation at higher latitudes.","Matsson, S.; Christie, H.C.; Fieler, R.",WOS:000471111300053,"Matsson, Sanna, S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.03.068,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Bryozoa,"Epibionts, ""Seaweed farming""",NULL,Bryozoans; Biomass yield; Low trophic level aquaculture,Journal article,NULL,NULL

They are particularly susceptible to common forms of anthropogenic influences including sewage effluent runoff and flow modification. We hypothesized that the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from three rivers (Nyl, Mogalakwena and Limpopo) within a semi-arid region (Limpopo, South Africa) will decline in response to shifts in water quality resulting from sewage effluent runoff. We assessed the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from ten sites using univariate and multivariate analyses, and community responses were determined based upon anthropogenic disturbances. Our results show distinct spatial and temporal variation between the sampling sites and their associated macroinvertebrate communities. Spatial separation is attributable to increased concentrations of nitrogenous-based pollutants (total nitrogen and nitrites) and manganese, both of which are associated with sewage effluent runoff released by the Modimolle Waste Water Treatment Facility. Temperature is the principle driver of temporal variation amongst the macroinvertebrate communities, with winter (June 2016) communities being more diverse than summer (February 2017) communities. Macroinvertebrates remain important bioindicator organisms for riverine ecosystems, specifically within semi-arid regions. Our study highlights the need for more comprehensive diversity assessments of riverine macroinvertebrates, specifically from southern Africa, a region of the world that remains significantly underrepresented in the scientific literature of aquatic ecology. These results further increase our understanding of aquatic biodiversity within semi-arid regions and provides a baseline for future monitoring efforts and management in South Africa.","Baker, N.J.; Greenfield, R.",WOS:000470964500081,"Baker, Nick, N.J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",South Africa,NULL,"Multivariate analysis, ""Sewage effluents""",NULL,Aquatic macroinvertebrates; Aquatic health; Limpopo Province,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The objective of the present study was to establish the population structure of <i>Crassostrea rhizophorae</i> in Bahía Cispatá, as a basic input for the future formulation of management plans. Due to the morphological differences observed among the individuals of the sampled sites, sequences of the COI gene were obtained, concluding that all individuals correspond to the species Crassostrea rhizophorae. Based on the morphological differences, two populations were differentiated, which did not show coexistence in the same sampling station. Through the FiSAT program, the main population parameters were evaluated, finding that individuals of the population with thin shells grow at a faster rate, reaching greater sizes than individuals from the population of more robust and strong shells. However, individuals with thin shells also had higher mortality rates. For both populations, the food supply was very low, which may have influenced the low population density found during 2015. It is important to highlight the importance of this resource in the area and the advantage presented by the more robust oyster’s specimens for fishermen since is that it allows them to have it to be stored for longer than the thin shell oyster.","Lopez Sanchez, C.M.; Mancera Pineda, J.E.",WOS:000468141900016,"Lopez Sanchez, Clara Marcela, C.M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.15446/abc.v24n2.68941,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Bivalvia, ""Mollusca""",Coastal lagoons,NULL,coastal ecosystems; environmental value; swamp.,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Furthermore, their distribution is assessed according to marine subregions outlined by the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive: Adriatic Sea (ADRIA), Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean Sea (CMED), and Western Mediterranean Sea (WMED). In Italy, 265 NIS have been detected with the highest number of species being recorded in the CMED (154 species) and the WMED (151 species), followed by the ADRIA (143). Most of these species were recorded in more than one subregion. The NIS that have established stable populations in Italian Seas are 180 (68%), among which 26 have exhibited invasive traits. Among taxa involved, Macrophyta rank first with 65 taxa. Fifty-five of them are established in at least one subregion, mostly in the ADRIA and the CMED. Crustacea rank second with 48 taxa, followed by Polychaeta with 43 taxa, Mollusca with 29 taxa, and Pisces with 28 taxa, which were mainly reported from the CMED. In the period 2012-2017, 44 new alien species were recorded, resulting in approximately one new entry every two months. Approximately half of the NIS (~52%) recorded in Italy have most likely arrived through the transport-stowaway pathway related to shipping traffic (~28% as biofoulers, ~22% in ballast waters, and ~2% as hitchhikers). The second most common pathway is the unaided movement with currents (~19%), followed by the transport-contaminant on farmed shellfishes pathway  (~18%). Unaided is the most common pathway for alien Fisshes, especially in CMED. Escapes from confinement account for ~3% and release in nature for ~2% of the NIS. The present NIS distribution hotspots for new introductions were defined on the first recipient area/location in Italy. In ADRIA the hotspot is Venice which accounts for the highest number of alien taxa introduced in Italy, with 50 newly recorded taxa. In the CMED, hotspots of introduction are the Taranto and Catania Gulfs, hosting 21 first records each. The Strait of Sicily represents a crossroad between the alien taxa from the Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific area. In the WMED, hotspots of bioinvasions include the Gulfs of Naples, Genoa and Livorno.

Relatively high values of diversity for both total and living assemblages, 101 and 96 species, respectively, have been documented. These figures are sensibly higher than those documented in most of the previous studies around Kuwait territorial waters. Porcelaneous test in terms of abundance dominates the foraminiferal assemblages followed by hyaline tests and only a minor part of the assemblages was represented by agglutinated foraminifera. The high dominance of porcelaneous tests might be explained by the peculiar physiographic setting and the presence of coral reef around the Island. Very low foraminiferal abundances were associated with shallower environments, like the subtidal zone around the island, whereas higher values were found at deeper and more distal stations. Planispiral morphotypes were found dominant at the more shallow-proximal stations, while milioline morphotypes dominated at intermediate depth and trochospiral morphotypes were more abundant at greater water depth.

Morphology is the cornerstone of digenean systematics, but molecular markers have been instrumental in searching for a stable classification system of the subclass and in establishing more accurate species limits. The first comprehensive molecular phylogenetic tree of Digenea published in 2003 used two nuclear rRNA genes (ssrDNA = 18S rDNA and lsrDNA = 28S rDNA) and was based on 163 taxa representing 77 nominal families, resulting in a widely accepted phylogenetic classification. The genetic library for the 28S rRNA gene has increased steadily over the last 15 years because this marker possesses a strong phylogenetic signal to resolve sister-group relationships among species and to infer phylogenetic relationships at higher levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. Here, we have updated the database of 18S and 28S rRNA genes until December 2017, we have added newly generated 28S rDNA sequences and we have reassessed phylogenetic relationships to test the current higher-level classification of digeneans (at the subordinal and subfamilial levels). The new dataset consisted of 1077 digenean taxa allocated to 106 nominal families for 28S and 419 taxa in 98 families for 18S. Overall, the results were consistent with previous higher-level classification schemes, and most superfamilies and suborders were recovered as monophyletic assemblages. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, new phylogenetic hypotheses from complete mitochondrial genomes have been proposed, although their power to resolve deep levels of trees remains controversial. Since data from NGS methods are replacing other widely used markers for phylogenetic analyses, it is timely to reassess the phylogenetic relationships of digeneans with conventional nuclear rRNA genes, and to use the new analysis to test the performance of genomic information gathered from NGS, e.g. mitogenomes, to infer higher-level relationships of this group of parasitic platyhelminths.","Pérez-Ponce de León, G.; Hernández-Mena, D.I.",WOS:000466110700001,"Pérez-Ponce de León, Gerardo, G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0022149x19000191,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Digenea, ""Trematoda""","Phylogeny, ""Taxonomy""",NULL,rDNA; NGS; ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Herein, we provide an extensive sample of <i>Amblyosyllis</i> material (115 specimens) from several world geographic areas.

Species delimitation methods such as distance analyses, statistical parsimony networks and multi-rate Poisson tree processes were also applied. The combined results obtained from different methodologies and data sets are used to differentiate between, at least, 19 lineages compatible with the separately evolving meta-populations species concept. Four of these lineages are identified as nominal species, including the type species of <i>Amblyosyllis</i>, <i>A. rhombeata</i>. For three other lineages previously synonymized names are recovered, and seven lineages are described as new species. All of these species are described and supported by appropriate iconography.

To understand the potential for hybridization and to investigate reproductive isolating mechanisms among icefish species, we performed in vitro fertilization experiments using eggs from a female blackfin icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus and sperm from a male of another genera, the ocellated icefish Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Sequencing of genomic and mitochondrial DNA confirmed the intergeneric hybrid nature of resulting embryos which successfully developed and hatched as active larvae at about four and a half months during the Antarctic winter. This result demonstrates the compatibility of gametes of these two species and the viability of resulting zygotes and larvae. Due to logistic constraints and the slow developmental rate of icefishes, we could not test for long-term hybrid viability, fertility, fitness, or hybrid breakdown. Analysis of our fishing records and available literature, however, suggests that the strongest barriers to hybridization among parapatric icefish species are likely to be behavioral and characterized by assortative mating and species-specific courtship and nesting behaviors. This conclusion suggests that, in long-lived fish species with late sexual maturity and high energetic investment in reproduction like icefishes, pre-mating barriers are energetically more efficient than post-mating barriers to prevent hybridization.","Desvignes, T.; Le François, N.R.; Goetz, L.C.; Smith, S.S.; Shusdock, K.A.; Parker, S.K.; Postlethwait, J.H.; Detrich III, H.W.",WOS:000464342700014,"Postlethwait, John, J.H.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-42354-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Cnidae have been shown to be used for primary anchoring during settling, and before this time point, the larvae most probably do not have the ability to attach to a substrate in high flow conditions. The appearance of functional cnidae coincides with larvae gaining a flexible mouth that can be opened to the full width of the larva. The larval isorhizas differ the most from the adult polyps isorhizas, while the p‐ and b‐mastigophores bear more resemblance to the adult homologues of similar size. The external and internal morphology of late planulae is further described with demonstration of long apical cilia and its effect on swimming agility, morphological changes of the ciliated cells in the larval mouth region and an internal nerve plexus.

Major taxa studied: Amphibians, arthropods, brachiopods, cnidarians, echinoderms, fishes, molluscs, reptiles. Methods: We draw together new and existing data quantifying the warm acclimation response in 319 species as the acclimation response ratio (ARR): the increase in upper thermal limit per degree increase in experimental temperature. We develop worst‐case scenario climate projections to calculate the number of years and generations gained by ARR until loss of thermal safety. We further compute a vulnerability score that integrates across variables estimating exposure to climate change and species‐specific tolerance through traits, including physiological plasticity, generation time and latitudinal range extent.Results: ARR is highly variable, but with marked differences across taxa, habitats and latitude. Polar terrestrial arthropods show high ARRs [95% upper confidence limit (UCL95%) = 0.68], as do some polar aquatic invertebrates that were acclimated for extended durations (ARR > 0.4). While this physiological plasticity buys 100s of years until thermal safety is lost, combination with long generation times leads to decreased potential for evolutionary adaptation. Additionally, 27% of marine polar invertebrates have no capacity for acclimation and reptiles and amphibians have minimal ARR (UCL95% = 0.16). Low physiological plasticity, long generations times and restricted latitudinal ranges combine to distinguish reptiles, amphibians and polar invertebrates as being highly vulnerable amongst ectotherms. Main conclusions:  In some taxa the combined effects of acclimation capacity and generation time can provide 100s of years and generations before thermal safety is lost. The accuracy of assessments of vulnerability to climate change will be improved by considering multiple aspects of species’ biology that, in combination may increase persistence under extreme heat events, and increase the probability for evolutionary rescue.","Morley, S.A.; Peck, L.S.; Sunday, J.M.; Heiser, S.; Bates, A.E.",WOS:000471822300012,"Heiser, S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12911,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To fill this gap, we studied the marine nematode assemblages in CDZs from two coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea to describe the diversity, test the effects of spatial scales, and explore if there were adaptive biological trait combinations. We sampled 2 reefs (Ballenatos and Punta Francés), 6 sites, and 20 dead coral piles in a fully nested design identifying the nematodes to species level. CDZs harbored a diverse nematode assemblage of 112 species with large spatial turnover. Differences between reefs in abundance and species density were probably related to differential energy availability, with Punta Francés receiving larger input of material and energy from land. The spatial scale had a significant effect on the species richness, whereas differences in species composition were mainly driven by the scale at which ecological drivers operated (10<sup>−1</sup> m for interstitial heterogeneity vs. 10<sup>5</sup> m for dispersal). Geographical distances in the order of 180 km likely constituted barriers to nematode dispersal and as such promoted assemblage dissimilarity. Our evidence indicated that a particular set of biological traits favored the adaptation of nematodes to CDZs, namely a distinctive combination of armed stoma, ornamented cuticle, and conical tail.","Pérez-García, J.A.; Marzo-Pérez, D.; Armenteros, M.",WOS:000478774000017,"Armenteros, Maickel, M.","Univ La Habana, Ctr Invest Marinas, Playa, CiudadHabana, Cuba.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-019-00945-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Nematodes, ""Species composition"", ""Species richness""",NULL,Coral reef; Biological traits; Dispersal; EiE hypothesis ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

A radiocarbon chronology for the region suggests that settlement patterns are consistent with what has been observed in coastal locations, with an increase in site density throughout the late Holocene. Groundstone is an important component of the late Holocene archaeological record, although it decreases in importance following the droughts of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA; 1150–600 cal BP). <i>Olivella biplicata</i> shell bead production at dense midden sites indicates that occupation of the region was not just for access to terrestrial resources. An increase in sites with projectile points during the MCA may reflect an increase in interpersonal violence and indicate that increasing territoriality that occurred on the coast may have extended into the island interior.

One of the most abundant keystone megafauna species occurring in this MPA is a yellow gorgonian of genus <i>Placogorgia</i> Wright and Studer (1889), occurring in relatively high densities in steep slopes with rocky outcrops at depths ranging 500–1200 m. Here, we describe a new species of isopod, <i>Astacilla andresmeixidei</i> sp. nov., living in association with a specimen of a yellow gorgonian collected at 525 m depth. Females of the new species are characterised by a trapezoidal pereonite 4 with a middorsal bifurcate tubercle on posterior margin; males have a rectangular pereonite 4 with small tubercles irregularly distributed and pereonite 3 with a midventral process. The new species is distinguished from the most morphologically similar species <i>Astacilla gorgonophila</i> Monod (1925) by its dorsal sculpture, having a shorter antenna 2 with a flagellum of three articles plus a claw, and also by its geographic and bathymetric distribution. Phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial marker COI confirmed that the new isopod is a member of the family Arcturidae and placed it in a clade, recovered with low support, including other species of the genus <i>Astacilla</i> Cordiner, 1793. As with other previously described arcturids, we suggest that <i>A. andresmeixidei</i> sp. nov. is a commensal of the gorgonian using its branches to reach higher in the water column and thus increase its chances to get more particulate organic matter. Our morphological analyses on the gorgonian host, suggest that it belongs to the genus <i>Placogorgia</i> although in our phylogenetic results using the nuclear marker msh1 the gorgonian shows affinities with the genus <i>Paramuricea</i> Kölliker (1865).

Modern approaches to resolve the notorious challenges of coral taxonomy have only recently been applied to Red Sea taxa. This chapter reviews current knowledge of the distributions of coral species in the Arabian region, including assessments of endemism. We also review new species described (or resurrected) since the last major assessment (in 2002). Where sufficient data is available, we highlight within-region distribution patterns. The Red Sea has the highest levels of endemism among all regions of the Indian Ocean. Analysis of the similarity of species composition among the Arabian subregions shows that the Red Sea and Socotra Island are the most speciose, but also have distinct community compositions. The regional diversity of Red Sea corals is likely influenced by the unique environmental gradients of the Arabian region. Despite evolving in testing conditions, Red Sea corals have been impacted by global climate change. Recent thermal bleaching events in the Red Sea highlight the pressures and challenges to future recovery.","Berumen, M.L.; Arrigoni, R.; Bouwmeester, J.; Terraneo, T.I.; Benzoni, F.",NULL,"Berumen, Michael, M.L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-05802-9_7,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Indo-Pacific,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Climate change"", ""Coral"", ""Endemism"", ""Taxonomy""",NULL,Coral bleaching; Genetic connectivity ,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

The Galápagos Islands are renowned for their exceptional biological diversity; however, marine dinoflagellate communities have not been represented in biodiversity assessments. Therefore, this study aims to provide key information about dinoflagellate diversity and abundances, with special attention to harmful species, during a weak La Niña event in the Galápagos Marine Reserve (GMR). The study was performed during March–April 2017 and four transects were conducted at four Islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Fé, Seymour, and Pinzón) representing the southern region of the GMR. Water net samples were collected at 2, 5, and 10 nautical miles (nm) from the coast, at a total of 48 sampling sites. The presence of toxic species, and their cell abundance was estimated in seven transects at 0, 15, and 30 m of depth. A total of 152 taxa belonging to 7 orders, 22 families, and 38 genera were registered. The number of taxa found is almost three times higher than the maximum observed in previous studies. Dinoflagellate species richness among stations ranged between 53 and 23 taxa and was higher in northern sites. From the applied cluster analysis, five dinoflagellate assemblages were identified as a discrete community structure, one was found only in Santa Fé Island, which is probably related to the presence of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). Regarding cell abundance estimations, low abundances were registered throughout the sampling sites and no blooms were detected. Higher abundances were registered in the northern transects coinciding with one of the most productive areas of the archipelago, situated north of Santa Cruz. Among the identified taxa, 19 of them were potentially toxic, including epiphytic species, allowing the possibility of blooms in benthic areas. This study presents the first record of several dinoflagellate species in the area (both non-toxic and harmful species) and thus, emphasizing the need for the implementation of phytoplankton monitoring programs by the government to prevent potential ecological, sanitary and economic impacts in the GMR.","Carnicer, O.; De La Fuente, P.; Canepa, A.; Keith, I.; Rebolledo-Monsalve, E.; Diogène, J.; Fernandez-Tejedor, M.",WOS:000467019300001,"Fernandez-Tejedor, Margarita, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00235,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,harmful algal blooms; dinoflagellate assemblages; richness; spatial variability; CCA; Generalized Additive Models; environmental parameters    ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of <i>Octopus cyanea</i> and <i>O. vulgaris</i> populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of <i>O. vulgaris</i> from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for <i>O. oliver</i>i and <i>Callistoctopus luteus</i> in the WIO. For <i>O. cyanea</i> (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For <i>O. vulgaris</i> (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p � 0.01).

Located almost 150 kilometers from the nearest coast in Belize, Ceibal was a large community spanning the Middle Preclassic through early Postclassic periods (1000 b.c.–a.d. 1200). It therefore provides an excellent opportunity to assess the marine resources imported through the southern Maya lowlands over many centuries, offering insight into trade networks, uses of shell ornaments, religious beliefs and rituals, and other activities involving marine species. The study compares marine invertebrate data from Ceibal to a neighboring subordinate community, Caobal, as well as data previously reported from sites in the southern Mesoamerican lowlands, in order to understand regional sociocultural and trade connections over time. The majority of Ceibal's marine taxa are Atlantic species and reflect shell trends observed elsewhere in Guatemala and Belize, suggesting strong ties to trade networks eastward to the coast that lasted many centuries.","Sharpe, A.E.",WOS:000577555600007,"Sharpe, Ashley, A.E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/S0956536118000366,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We collected actinotrochs from the waters of the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama, and used DNA barcoding of mtCOI, as well as 16S and 18S sequences, to estimate the diversity of phoronids in the region. We discovered three operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Bay of Panama on the Pacific coast and four OTUs in Bocas del Toro on the Caribbean coast. Not only did all OTUs differ from each other by >10% pairwise distance in COI, but they also differed from all phoronid sequences in GenBank, including the four species for which adults have been reported for the Pacific of Panama, <i>Phoronopsis harmeri, Phoronis psammophila, Phoronis muelleri</i>, and <i>Phoronis hippocrepia</i>. In each ocean region, one common OTU was more abundant and occurred more frequently than other OTUs in our samples. The other five OTUs were relatively rare, with only one to three individuals collected during the entire project. Species accumulation curves were relatively flat but suggest that at least one more species is likely to be present at each site. Actinotrochs from the seven sequenced OTUs had morphologies typical of species with non‐brooded planktotrophic development and, in some cases, may be distinguished by differences in pigmentation and the arrangement of blood masses. We found one larva with morphology typical of brooded planktotrophic larvae for which sequencing failed, bringing the total number of potential species detected to eight and representing >50% of the adult species currently recognized globally.","Collin, R.; Venera-Pontón, D.E.; Driskell, A.C.; Macdonald, K.S.; Chan, K.Y.K.; Boyle, M.J.",WOS:000471895200002,"Collin, Rachel, R.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ivb.12242,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the ten years since then, EMODnet has become a key producer of publicly available, harmonised datasets covering broad areas. This paper describes the methodologies applied in EMODnet Geology project to produce fully populated GIS layers of seabed substrate distribution for the European marine areas. We describe steps involved in translating national seabed substrate data, conforming to various standards, into a uniform EMODnet substrate classification scheme (i.e., the Folk sediment classification). Rock and boulders form an additional substrate class. Seabed substrate data products at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:1 million, compiled using descriptions and analyses of seabed samples as well as interpreted acoustic images, cover about 20% and 65% of the European maritime areas, respectively.

This study aims at reconstructing these facies changes in the 'Land Wursten' region (Lower Saxony) by focussing on so-called dwog horizons (incipient soil horizons of the pre-engineered salt marshes). We explore their implications for relative sea-level reconstructions and their indication for early settlement activities. Archive drilling data (1960, provided by the 'Landesamt fur Bergbau, Energie und Geologie') were analysed to create five high-resolution stratigraphic cross sections. Three new drilling records were subjected to sedimentological and microfaunal investigations and interpreted to verify and calibrate the archive data. Two dwog horizons were found and C-14-AMS dated. We found basal salt marsh deposits inundated by a high-energy event and covered by tidal flat sediments. The thick tidal flat unit is again overlain by salt marsh deposits indicating the transition from a shallow marine to a terrestrial environment where dwogs were developed and covered by episodic marine incursions. The ages of the dwogs (1128-969 cal BC; cal AD 1426-1467) do not correlate with known layers of adjacent settlement sites and are critically discussed. However, we show that they correlate with phases of stagnant regional relative sea level (RSL) and can be used as RSL indicators. The combined archive and modern data provide valuable information for the RSL reconstruction and palaeoenvironmental changes. However, further research is recommended to accomplish more detailed information about coastal response during the Holocene sea-level changes and implications for settlement dynamics.","Scheder, J.; Engel, M.; Bungenstock, F.; Pint, A.; Siegmuller, A.; Schwank, S.; Bruckner, H.",WOS:000425016300004,"Scheder, J, J."," Lower Saxony Inst Hist Coastal Res, Viktoriastr 26-28, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11852-017-0502-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,North Sea; Holocene; Landscape changes; Palaeoenvironment; Relativesea-level changes; Settlement history,NULL,NULL,NULL

Extracts of the algae selected for the study were prepared using ethanol. The study presents original results concerning the total phenolic content (TPC), determined by the spectrometric method (Folin-Ciocalteu method) and the individual phenols from each species of seaweed studied were identified by HPLC-DAD techniques. Total antioxidant activity (ACL) was studied by photochemiluminescence method, and antibacterial activity was studied on two strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 - gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P - gram-positive. Results indicated that the highest total phenolic content was obtained for Cladophora vagabunda (325.8 mg/100 g f.w.), followed by Ulva lactuca (285.5 mg/100 g f.w.) and the lowest rate was registered by Enteromorpha intestinalis (268.8 mg/100 g f.w.).

In addition, two other phenolic compounds were identified in lower concentrations in <i>Ulva lactuca</i>, but only one phenolic compound in <i>Enteromorpha intestinalis</i>. The results of this study show that there is a strong correlation between antioxidant activity (ACL), antibacterial activity and total phenolic content (TPC).

Moreover, the lack of clearly defined morpho-taxonomic criteria led to a great confusion concerning the discrimination of <i>Quinqueloculine</i> and <i>Triloculine</i> tests. This study provides the first ribosomal DNA sequences of <i>Q. seminula</i> complemented with the detailed morphological and ecological investigation, based on material collected from an intertidal region along the Rajapuri creek, Maharashtra coast, north-eastern Arabian Sea. By analysing the characteristic morphological features, i.e., number of chambers, and length: width ratio, the specimens were sorted into different morpho-groups viz. juvenile (resembling <i>Triloculina</i>) and the typical adult forms. The genetic analysis utilising partial small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA) showed that all morphotypes of <i>Q. seminula</i> from the studied site branches within a single clade significantly differ from the sequences of <i>Q. seminulum</i>, suggesting a putative novel adaptation to different ecological conditions. Our results are in contrast with the assumption that all ecophenotypes of <i>Q. seminula</i> represent a genetically continuous species with a unique habitat and widespread biogeographic distribution. Our environmental investigation further indicates that the species favours intertidal hypersaline conditions, and seasonal distribution pattern shows a positive correlation with the salinity and temperature.","Kaushik, T.; Murugan, T.; Dagar, S.S.",WOS:000528060900002,"Kaushik, Tushar, T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2019.101748,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Quinqueloculina seminula,"Ecology, ""Foraminifera"", ""Taxonomy""",NULL,Arabian Sea; Wall ultrastructure; Molecular systematics; 18S rDNA; Molecular phylogeny,Journal article,NULL,NULL

There may be more than 100 000 shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea, however to date, their effects on biodiversity by the introduction of large hard substrates in this typically low-evenness, species-poor ecosystem have received little attention. This study compared separately macrobenthic assemblages found on three different objects (an old torpedo house, a former submarine and a minesweeper) lying at various depths (2–21 m) in Puck Bay (the Gulf of Gdańsk, Baltic Sea), and corresponding assemblages in soft sediments from their close (5 m away) and far vicinity (50 m away). A total of 26 taxa of macrobenthic algae, vascular plants and fauna were recorded. Nineteen species were found directly on the study objects. Nine species among them were only found on the submerged objects but none was substrate specific. At two locations clear differences in the assemblage structure between seabed in the close proximity of submerged objects and the seabed located farther apart were noted. Higher species richness, abundance and diversity (measured as Shannon-Wiener H′) was recorded only in the location of the deepest object. Its high similarity (both in terms of the assemblage structure and S, N, H’) with the closest neighbouring sediments may indicate a direct impact of the object on the surrounding seabed. The submerged objects generally supported a two - three times higher number of species and a ∼25 times higher number of individuals (but not diversity) than the soft bottom in the vicinity. The shallowest object lying within the euphotic zone hosted the most species rich (on avg. 10 species/144 cm<sup>2</i>) and abundant (on avg. 379 ind./144 cm<sup>2</sup>) assemblages. Differences in the assemblage structure found between different objects are most likely associated with depth related environmental variables. The results of the study can serve as a baseline for future investigations and for evaluation of local ecological effects of the artificial reef concepts, breakwaters and offshore wind farms.","Balazy, P.; Copeland, U.; Sokolowski, A.",WOS:000478712800004,"Copeland, Ula, U.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.05.022,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Macrobenthos,NULL,Wreck; Artificial hard substrate; Baltic sea; SCUBA,Journal article,NULL,NULL

They are characteristic for the entire Norwegian coast, where growing human populations and economic development increasingly impact the associated fjord ecosystems, and accordingly basic knowledge about ecosystem structure and functioning is needed. Knowledge about benthic systems within deep basins (over 400 m) of sub-Arctic fjords is currently missing and it remains questionable whether our understanding of similarly deep temperate fjords or shallower sub-arctic fjords is directly transferable to such systems. This study aims to investigate the patterns of soft-bottom benthic communities within a northern Norwegian deep multibasin fjord system and relate them to the prevailing environmental conditions, following a sampling strategy of many-sites with one-sample each. Here we show that oxygen content of the water and organic matter gradients in the sediment, structure the benthic communities of the fjord reflecting the main basins. We found that the community of the deepest basin (>700 m) of this sub-Arctic fjord is similar to the community just outside of Tysfjord at the same depth but differ from other communities within the fjord. Furthermore, the deep basin community reflects deep communities of temperate fjords and the deep Skagerrak. The community within the innermost basin is well adapted to periodic hypoxia with low quality or degraded food supply. Our results demonstrated that fjord specific multibasin topography and the corresponding environmental factors are important drivers of ecological processes, which resulted in distinct benthic communities in each of the three basins. The management of such heterogeneous fjord ecosystems should take an adaptive approach and apply measures that take the differences of these benthic communities into account.","Molina, E.J.; Silberberger, M.J.; Kokarev, V.; Reiss, H.",WOS:000478712800003,"Reiss, Henning, H.","Benthos Ecology Research Unit, Ecology Division, Nord University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.05.021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

These drivers are often poorly understood in marine environments, which have fewer obvious barriers to mixing than terrestrial environments. Taxonomic uncertainty of some taxa (e.g., cetaceans), due to the difficulty in obtaining morphological data, can hamper our understanding of these processes. One such taxon, the short‐finned pilot whale, is recognized as a single global species but includes at least two distinct morphological forms described from stranding and drive hunting in Japan, the “Naisa” and “Shiho” forms. Using samples (n = 735) collected throughout their global range, we examine phylogeographic patterns of divergence by comparing mitogenomes and nuclear SNP loci. Our results suggest three types within the species: an Atlantic Ocean type, a western/central Pacific and Indian Ocean (Naisa) type, and an eastern Pacific Ocean and northern Japan (Shiho) type. mtDNA control region differentiation indicates these three types form two subspecies, separated by the East Pacific Barrier: Shiho short‐finned pilot whale, in the eastern Pacific Ocean and northern Japan, and Naisa short‐finned pilot whale, throughout the remainder of the species' distribution. Our data further indicate two diverging populations within the Naisa subspecies, in the Atlantic Ocean and western/central Pacific and Indian Oceans, separated by the Benguela Barrier off South Africa.

Harvesting its leaves for these purposes must be done in a sustainable manner for the preservation of the ecological goods and services it provides. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects that different cutting frequencies have on the species at Rincón de Guanabo, Cuba. The temporary variability of daily production, replacement rate, leaf biomass, epiphytic biomass, shoot density, leaf index, herbivory and reproduction were analyzed quarterly from April 2017 to April 2018. The effect of the continuous pruning of the leaves, every 60, 90 and 120 days, on the vegetative and reproductive structures and the nutrient content in the plant was analyzed in this year. Temporary variations in the dynamics of the species did not correspond directly with the annual fluctuations in temperature, they must be modulated by other local environmental factors. Hurricane Irma in September 2017 seems to have influenced the values of daily leaf production and the replacement rate, which were lower in April 2018 than in the same month of 2017. April and July were the months with the highest productivity, replacement rate and with the lowest biomass of epiphytes. The harvest of T. testudinum leaves every 120 days in the study area for a year, with the use of scissors, cutting 5 cm above the sediment and in areas of 0.25 m2, did not cause damage to the vegetative and reproductive structures, and there were no changes in the chemical components of the plant. Therefore, such conditions for the harvest of <i>T. testudinum</i> leaves are recommended until the impact of a larger scale harvest regime (time and area) is evaluated.","Gómez González, E.E.",NULL,"Gómez González, Emma Elena, E.E.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Nutrients, ""Productivity"", ""Reproduction""",NULL,foliar biomass; leaf harvest; temporary variation,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

A total of 418 mobile invertebrates spanning 63 taxa were recorded from 22 coral colonies. The three coral species hosted significantly different epifaunal communities, most likely a consequence of the difference in growth forms of the coral hosts. Significant differences in epifaunal communities were only observed between live and dead colonies of P. acuta, indicating that resource provisioning in this species is particularly influenced by the presence of live tissue.

The Chagos Archipelago is comprised of a series of atolls, including the largest atoll in the world, the Great Chagos Bank. Records from surveys of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; reefs 30–150 m depth) in Chagos stretch back to 1905, with more extensive work conducted in the 1970s and post-2010. Coral and fish communities vary considerably with depth and among habitat types. Coral cover generally declines with increased depth across the shallow reef to MCE depth gradient, though in several locations close to 100% scleractinian coral cover has been observed on MCEs. Consistent with earlier studies, we identify five coral species as indicative of Chagos MCEs. Recently collected fish community data are analyzed to illustrate, for the first time, patterns in reef fish species richness, abundance, biomass, and trophic groups across a shallow to upper-MCE depth gradient (0–60 m). Fish species richness, abundance, and biomass declined with increased depth, while richness, abundance, and trophic group patterns were also influenced by habitat type (seaward versus lagoonal reef).

Identifying regions with optimal growth conditions for the cultivation of specific seaweed species contributes to the cultivation process. An understanding how these regions evolve under climate change is required to ensure favorable growth conditions on the long-term. In the present research, regions with favorable growth conditions for specific seaweed species were identified by combining physiological and environmental data in a mechanistic niche model. The outcome of the mechanistic model is a species-specific response, the habitat suitability, which quantifies growth as a function of the temperature, salinity, light and nutrient requirements of the seaweed species. Habitat suitability was quantified in European marine waters for brown seaweeds (i.e. <i>Fucus serratus, F. vesiculosus, Ascophyllum nodosum, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea</i>) and red seaweeds (i.e. <i>Chondrus crispus, Gracilaria gracilis, Furcellaria lumbricalis</i>). The model was validated using independent distribution data and the validation statistic was good (area under the curve; AUC > 0.8) for five out of nine species and fair (0.6 < AUC < 0.8) for the remaining four species. The warm-temperate region extending from the coast of Portugal to the south coast of Brittany is currently a suitable habitat for most of the studied species. Due to climate change, we predict that the most optimal environmental conditions will shift northwards, <i>i.e.</i> 110 to 635 km by 2100, depending on the climate scenario. The results of the present study can be used to: (1) select target species for seaweed aquaculture in a specific marine region; (2) select sites for long-term, optimal growth conditions of the specific seaweed species in this study. As such, our results contribute to the decision making process in marine spatial planning and blue growth prioritization.","Westmeijer, G.; Everaert, G.; Pirlet, H.; De Clerck, O.; Vandegehuchte, M.B.",WOS:000472593800035,"De Clerck, Olivier, O.","Phycology Research Group, Biology Department, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.algal.2019.101529,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Habitat suitability; Mechanistic niche modelling; Northward range shift; Physiological thresholds; Seaweed aquaculture,Journal article,NULL,NULL

These abundant endo- or epibenthic organisms modify the physical structure and geochemical properties of sediments and, at broader ecosystem scales, impact nutrient flows and benthic community structure. The ecological importance of bioturbators depends on (1) their abundance and (2) the magnitude of their bioturbation activity. We suggest that parasitism has a substantial impact on bioturbators, with cascading effects on their role in ecosystem functioning. Reviewing 5940 papers concerning bioturbation and using a set of selective criteria, we identified 176 bioturbating species, with 31% of these potentially parasitized (micro- and macroparasites). However, there are significant discrepancies in the research effort on parasites among bioturbating groups, the highest effort being devoted to molluscs, whereas studies on annelids and arthropods are rare. Furthermore, studies addressing the impacts of parasites on their bioturbating hosts are still scarce, but evidence we do have indicates that parasites impair their hosts’ physiological state, fecundity, behaviour and survival. Because of impacts of parasites on phenotypic traits related to the bioturbation engineering activity of their hosts, parasitism could play a key role on ecosystem functioning through cascade effects. Yet, studies assessing the intricate link between parasites and their hosts’ bioturbation activity, including potential effects on ecosystem functioning, are very scarce.","Dairain, A.; Legeay, A.; de Montaudouin, X.",WOS:000485732200014,"Dairain, Annabelle, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12967,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Bioturbation · Parasitism · Ecosystem functioning · Behaviour modifications · Cascade effects,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here we present the first observational evidence of upwelled hydrothermally influenced deep waters stimulating massive phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean. Captured by profiling floats, two blooms were observed in the vicinity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, downstream of active hydrothermal vents along the Southwest Indian Ridge.

A long history of deep-ocean exploration and observation led to the initial concept for the Deep-Ocean Observing Strategy (DOOS), under the auspices of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).

We consider the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) needed to address deep-ocean challenges within the physical, biogeochemical, and biological/ecosystem sciences according to the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO), and map these onto scientific questions. Opportunities for new and expanded synergies among deep-ocean stakeholders are discussed, including academic-industry partnerships with the oil and gas, mining, cable and fishing industries, the ocean exploration and mapping community, and biodiversity conservation initiatives. Future deep-ocean observing will benefit from the greater integration across traditional disciplines and sectors, achieved through demonstration projects and facilitated reuse and repurposing of existing deep-sea data efforts. We highlight examples of existing and emerging deep-sea methods and technologies, noting key challenges associated with data volume, preservation, standardization, and accessibility. Emerging technologies relevant to deep-ocean sustainability and the blue economy include novel genomics approaches, imaging technologies, and ultra-deep hydrographic measurements. Capacity building will be necessary to integrate capabilities into programs and projects at a global scale. Progress can be facilitated by Open Science and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles and converge on agreed to data standards, practices, vocabularies, and registries. We envision expansion of the deep-ocean observing community to embrace the participation of academia, industry, NGOs, national governments, international governmental organizations, and the public at large in order to unlock critical knowledge contained in the deep ocean over coming decades, and to realize the mutual benefits of thoughtful deep-ocean observing for all elements of a sustainable ocean.","Levin, L.A.; Bett, B.J.; Gates, A.R.; Heimbach, P.; Howe, B.M.; Janssen, F.; McCurdy, A.; Ruhl, H.A.; Snelgrove, P.; Stocks, K.I.; Bailey, D.; Baumann-Pickering, S.; Beaverson, C.; Benfield, M.C.; Booth, D.J.; Carreiro-Silva, M.; Colaço, A.; Eblé, M.C.; Fowler, A.M.; Gjerde, K.M.; Jones, D.O.B.; Katsumata, K.; Kelley, D.; Le Bris, N.; Leonardi, A.P.; Lejzerowicz, F.; Macreadie, P.I.; McLean, D.; Meitz, F.; Morato, T.; Netburn, A.; Pawlowski, J.; Smith, C.R.; Sun, S.; Uchida, H.; Vardaro, M.F.; Venkatesan, R.; Weller, R.A.",WOS:000469301800001,"Lejzerowicz, Franck, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00241,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Hence, the volume, turbidity, and total suspended solids (TSS) of the water runoff were investigated. A rainfall simulation test was conducted to test the effectiveness of the cover material (biocomposite) at different application levels (0 kg/m2 (T1), 3.0 kg/m2 (T2), 4.0 kg/m2 (T3), and 5.0 kg/m2 (T4)) of the composite in reducing soil erosion. Overall, the OPEFB-SW composite demonstrated its capability to absorb rainfall impact and therefore stabilize the soil structure. The runoff volume, turbidity, and TSS were reduced significantly to 49.1%, 94.6%, and 99.2%, respectively. In addition, the plot with 4.0 kg/m2 indicates the best treatment in regulating runoff volume, turbidity, and TSS.","Ashikin, N.S.S.N.; Djalaluddin, A.; Yusuff, S.; Khalil, H.P.S.A.; Syakir, M.I.",WOS:000473204700035,"Ashikin, Nurin, N.S.S.N.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Soil erosion control; Oil palm empty fruit bunch; Seaweed; Biocomposite; Oil palm plantation; Agricultural waste; Turbidity; Total suspended solids; Runoff volume; Water quality,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, these overall and independently studied patterns may conceal regional differences that help support or qualify the causes in these gradients. Here, we analysed both latitudinal and depth gradients of species richness in the NW Pacific and its adjacent Arctic Ocean. We analysed 324,916 distribution records of 17,414 species from 0 to 10,900 m depth, latitude 0 to 90°N, and longitude 100 to 180°N. Species richness per c. 50 000 km2 hexagonal cells was calculated as alpha (local average), gamma (regional total) and ES50 (estimated species for 50 records) per latitudinal band and depth interval. We found that average ES50 and gamma species richness decreased per 5° latitudinal bands and 100 m depth intervals. However, average ES50 per hexagon showed that the highest species richness peaked around depth 2,000 m where the highest total number of species recorded. Most (83%) species occurred in shallow depths (0 to 500 m). The area around Bohol Island in the Philippines had the highest alpha species richness (more than 8,000 species per 50,000 km2). Both alpha and gamma diversity trends increased from the equator to latitude 10°N, then further decreased, but reached another peak at higher latitudes. The latitudes 60–70°N had the lowest gamma and alpha diversity where there is almost no ocean in our study area. Model selection on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) showed that the combined effects of all environmental predictors produced the best model driving species richness in both shallow and deep sea. The results thus support recent hypotheses that biodiversity, while highest in the tropics and coastal depths, is decreasing at the equator and decreases with depth below ~2000 m. While we do find the declines of species richness with latitude and depth that reflect temperature gradients, local scale richness proved poorly correlated with many environmental variables. This demonstrates that while regional scale patterns in species richness may be related to temperature, that local scale richness depends on a greater variety of variables.","Saeedi, H.; Costello, M.; Warren, D.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000472837000027,"Costello, Mark, M.","Institute of Marine Science, University of Auckland",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-45813-9,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Samplings were carried out at five stations in the intertidal zone in June (rainy season) and December (dry season), 2011. At each station, three samples were taken using a corer with 3cm diameter, which was thrust 10cm into the substrate and stratified in 0-2, 2-5, and 5-10cm. Meiofauna was comprised of 16 groups and Nematoda was the dominant. Meiofauna density during rainy season was higher at the central intertidal station and during dry season it was lower near the high tide mark, followed by an increasing trend towards the low tide mark. Meiofauna was more concentrated in the upper sediment layer during rainy season. However, during dry season, the highest density occurred in the lower sediment layer at both stations near the high tide mark. Nematoda association was comprised of 72 genera, with <em>Daptonema</em> and <em>Theristus</em> (both from the family Xyalidae) as the dominant ones in most stations and strata. The genera richness and diversity increased towards the low tide mark, with lower richness in the upper stratum at most stations. Non-selective deposit-feeders predominated during rainy season, while at dry season there was an alternation of dominance between non-selective deposit-feeders and epistrate feeders. Significant differences were found in the meiofauna community, as well as in the Nematoda association in regard to the months, stations, and sediment layers.

For the first time, the lateral tube that connects the left male receptacle with the right, smaller receptacle was observed in sagittal section and illustrated in the diagrammatic figure of male organs. This tube is probably the generator of sperm ribbons. As well, the existence of the spermatozoa inside the lumen of this connecting tube may indicate their free movement between the two receptacles.

Comparison of multi-year data on species composition, biodiversity and quantitative variables of phytoplankton that developed in the Dnistrovskiy Estuary every summer. Particular attention was focused on the development of potentially dangerous (toxic) species, which can deteriorate quality of water and threaten hydrobionts‟ existence. Methods. The data used in the phytoplankton study have been collected from 22 stations in the Dnistrovskiy Estuary (456 samples). Phytoplankton sampling and analyses were carried out using standard methodologies. Nageotta и Sedgewick cameras (0,05 and 1 ml) were applied to count cell number. The samples were preserved using formalin. HUND-H600 and OLIMPUS-BH2 microscopes were used for sample analyses. Classification of microalgae and Cyanobacteria was done according to the standards of the international database. Results. The total number of species registered during 16 years exceeded 445 (13 taxa) out of which 54 are generally classified as potentially harmful species (genera Dolichospermum, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis, Cyclotella, Pseudo-nitzschia, Peridinium, Prorocentrum etc.). Minimum record of species number within 4 main taxa was in 2004 and 2016. Maximum number of species of Chlorophyta (75) was observed in 2012, and maximum of Bacillariophyta (53), Dinophyta (19) and Cyanobacteria (33) was in 2014. Northern and middle part of the estuary had the highest species diversity (Shannon index = 4.6 – 4.4 bit∙cells<sup>-1</sup> ) i.e. the areas where flora of various geneses mixed. Over the years, number of species and α-diversity of phytoplankton tend to increase in the north and in the centre of the estuary. The range of changes of maximum values of microalgae biomass during 16-year period was from 2.5 g·m<sup>–3</sup> (2010) to 231.2 g·m<sup>–3</sup> (2018). Algal blooms were recorded with Bacillariophyceae and Cyanobacteria as dominants. Conclusions. There is a certain 12-year periodicity in gradual changes in the number of species and Shannon index within the main phytoplankton taxa. Recent years‟ trends toward increase in the total biomass of microalgae and Cyanobacteria have been traced as well, the consequence of such an increase being deterioration of water quality which has downgraded to ""polluted"" or ""extremely polluted"" in those regions (as per national standards).","Dereziuk, N.V.",NULL,"Dereziuk, N.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.26565/1992-4259-2019-20-06,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"biodiversity, Shannon index, biomass, blooms, water quality",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Phenotypic plasticity is a survival mechanism known to aid organisms in colonizing novel habitats, especially when these habitats are highly heterogeneous and organisms might benefit from occupying a distinct ecological niche. Microhabitat is one of the theoretical drivers behind organismal plasticity, particularly in a reef ecosystem with a variety of available substrates. <i>Culcita novaeguineae</i> is a common tropical reef starfish widespread in the Pacific that exhibits a range of phenotypic variation in its colors and patterning. Factors related to the morphological variation in this species have not been examined, and little is known about the ecology and life history of this species in general. The color diversity of thirty-one <i>C. novaeguineae</i> individuals was quantified using digital photography and an HSB color space, and these values were assessed for correlation to reef substrates that stars selected. Substrate preference by individuals was investigated and found to be non-random among substrate types present on the fringing reef. Additional analysis showed that the coloration of a star can serve as a predictor of which substrate it may select. The findings of this study reveal a relationship between color variation and the microhabitat selection of <i>C. novaeguineae</i>.

Benthic foraminifera prove to be excellent proxy organisms for assessing favorability of water conditions for coral growth and sustained health. This study revisited sites on the island of Mo'orea from a foraminiferal survey conducted in 1992 with the objective of assessing changes in community composition and water quality index values along the length of Cook's Bay over time. Comparisons were made between 2018 assemblages of living foraminifera, 2018 assemblages of living and dead foraminifera, and 1992 assemblages of living and dead foraminifera. A gradient of increasing water quality index values from the inner bay to the back reef was observed in 1992 assemblages but not in 2018 assemblages. This suggests the nature of the pollution source has changed from a point source to a non-point source, but differences could also be due to variation in sampling locations and techniques. A principle component analysis revealed systematic differences in proportions of several opportunistic genera between 2018 assemblages of living foraminifera and 2018 assemblages of living and dead foraminifera. More information is needed to determine the cause of these differences.

Thus, the main aim of the current study is to evaluate the behavioural toxicity of cigarette butt leachates (CBL) in freshwater bivalve species <em>Anodontites trapesialis</em> exposed to different environmentally-relevant dilutions (CBL1x = 1.375%, CBL10x: 13.75%). There were significant CBL effects on the burrowing performance of the evaluated bivalves, after 14 exposure days. Animals exposed to CBL presented higher latency to foot emission and to start the burrowing process, as well as larger number of cycles required for burial. In addition, there were lower burrowing angle and burrowing rate index in CBL-exposed bivalves than in the unexposed ones. Chemical analyses performed on the muscle tissues of animals exposed to both CBL dilutions evidenced the bioaccumulation of several metals at high concentrations in CBL (Cr, Ni, Pb, Mn, Zn and Na); this outcome enabled associating these metals with behavioural changes observed in CBL-exposed groups. Thus, the current study firstly reports that even highly-diluted CBL concentrations can induce behavioural changes in freshwater bivalves, as well as that CBL extrapolation to natural environments can lead to several damages to the fitness of living organisms and to the dynamics of their population.","Montalvão, M.F.; Chagas, T.Q.; Gabriela da Silva Alvarez, T.; Mesak, C.; Pereira da Costa Araújo, A.; Gomes, A.R.; Emmanuela de Andrade Vieira, J.; Rocha, T.L.; Malafaia, G.",WOS:000488136200041,"Montalvão, Mateus, M.F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.100,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Mollusca,NULL,NULL,Emerging pollutants; Molluscs; Aquatic pollution; Behavioural biomarkers,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The aim is to help archaeologists consider all shells as potential artifacts. The first example considers shell ornaments of hunter-gatherer populations who lived along the Atlantic coast during the sixth millennium BC. The second example focuses on a “treasure box” belonging to a child buried between the third and fourth centuries AD. The third examines a decoration style dating from the third century AD, which consisted of decorating the walls of opulent villas with shells. The archaeomalacofaunal analysis of these examples of shell use entails a description of the physical characteristics of the chosen shells. It shows that the latter were carefully selected, but not necessarily modified before being used. It is clear that the shells were intended to be exposed, as prehistoric ornaments or elements of mural decoration. The shells that were selected differ from those selected for consumption. This is interesting, as it shows a marked division between the economic contribution of marine mollusks and the symbolic value bestowed upon the shell. One shared aspect of the three cases is that shells of deep water species were gathered from high water marks on beaches. People rarely encountered these mollusks alive, which may have held additional cultural meaning. Ultimate artifact function of shells may, thus, relate closely to activities of shell selection from prehistoric beaches.","Dupont, C.",WOS:000482725200004,"Dupont, Catherine, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2993/0278-0771-39.2.223,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Despite decades of research and debate about why red abalone middens formed and how they relate to past human behavior and environmental change, significant questions persist about the nature of these sites and how they relate to broader trends in human diet and land use. Here, we present the results of excavation at three red abalone middens on the northern Channel Islands. Two of these middens, CA-SRI-26 on Santa Rosa Island and CA-SMI-692 on San Miguel Island, are among the older reported red abalone middens, at roughly 8000–7300 cal BP, and help fill a significant temporal gap in our understanding of the initial period of intensive red abalone harvest. The third midden, CA-SMI-172, dates to ~6300 cal BP and fills a spatial gap on eastern San Miguel Island. When placed in the context of other Channel Island red abalone middens, our analysis demonstrates that people at some of the earliest red abalone middens harvested more red abalone and larger sized individuals than later in time. These data suggest that people likely placed predation pressure on red abalones across the red abalone midden period (8500–3500 cal BP) and that human activities worked in tandem with other environmental changes to influence the disappearance of the red abalone midden phenomenon ~3500 years ago.","Rick, T.C.; Braje, T.J.; Erlandson, J.M.",WOS:000482725200003,"Erlandson, Jon McVey, J.M.","Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2993/0278-0771-39.2.204,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Unfortunately, the coast and islands of eastern Africa have not figured significantly within this growing body of literature, but are important given their historically contingent environmental, social, and political contexts, as well as the considerable threats now posed to marine ecosystems. Here, we begin developing a longer-term understanding of past marine resource use in the Mafia Archipelago (eastern Africa), an area of high ecological importance containing the Mafia Island Marine Park. Focusing on the comparatively less researched marine invertebrates provides a means for initiating discussion on potential past marine ecosystem structure, human foraging and environmental shifts, and the implications for contemporary marine resource management. The available evidence suggests that human-environment interactions over the last 2000 years were complex and dynamic; however, these data raise more questions than answers regarding the specific drivers of changes observed in the archaeomalacological record.

Ecto-and endo- parasites of silver kob (<i>Argyrosomus inodorus</i>) from northern Namibia (21º 24ºS). MSc Thesis. University of Namibia: Windhoek.  162 pp.","The silver kob (<i>Argyrosomus inodorus</i>) has been identified as a candidate species for finfish culture due to its outstanding qualities. There is little information available on the health of this species, especially parasite infestation that can pose a threat to fish cultivation and therefore to the success of mariculture. This study was thus designed to provide information on parasites that are affecting this species. Silver kob were collected monthly (2017–2018 for 11 months) using conventional fishing gear (n = 55) in Toscanini, Mile 108 and Henties Bay, northern Namibia (21° - 24°S). Fish were examined for ecto- and endo-parasites. Drawings and measurements of parasites were made using a camera lucida and calibrated eyepiece of an Olympus BX50 binocular microscope and/or a Zeiss (Discovery V8) camera calibrated on a Leica dissecting microscope. Parasite organ specificity was determined. Parasite prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance were analysed by season of capture, fish length and fish sex. Chi-square tests were used to determine differences in mean abundance by season, host sex and host length. Twenty-eight species from 17 parasite genera were found, including monogeneans (five Diplectanum spp., Sinodiplectanotrema sp., four Calceostoma spp., Neocalceosoma sp. and Sciaenacotyle sp.), digeneans (Helicometra sp., three Helicometrina sp., and Stephanostomum sp.), cestode larvae (Callitetrarhynchus sp., a Tetraphyllidean plerocercoid), a nematode (Anisakis sp.), a palaeacanthocephalan (Corynosoma australe), copepods (Caligus sp., Sciaenophilus sp., Lernanthropus sp., two Brachiella spp.) and an unknown parasite. More ecto-parasites were organ specific than endo-parasites. Corynosoma australe and Calceostoma spp. were significantly more abundant during the cold season (June-November) (X2 = 31.56, p <0.001 and X2 = 3.10, p value = 0.048, respectively), and Diplectanum spp. were significantly more abundant during the warm season (December-May) (X2 = 24.44, p <0.001). With the exception of digeneans, larger sized fish (TL > 47.3 cm) showed the highest prevalence and mean abundance of parasites compared to smaller sized fish (TL ≤ 35.8 cm). Calceostoma spp. and Helicometrina spp. showed a significant decrease in mean abundance with increasing host length (X2 = 28.22, p <0.01 and X2 = 5.77, p = 0.03, respectively). Corynosoma australe and Diplectanum spp. showed a significant increase (X2 = 20.2, p <0.01 and X2 = 41.1, p <0.001) in mean abundances with increasing host length. No fish sex preference was observed for parasite infections in silver kob. Macroscopically, most fish showed no visible symptoms of the parasite infestations. In severe intensities however, lesions of the fins and skin, and signs of haemorrhages were observed. This is the first study of ecto- and endo-parasites of Namibian silver kob A. inodorus. Molecular work and studies including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), histopathology, Health Assessment Index (HAI) and descriptive studies should be done to supplement the findings, identify all the parasites to their species level and determine the nature of infections of the parasites on the fish host.","Amakali, A.M.",NULL,"Amakali, Annette Megameno, A.M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

Mechanisms of cadmium-induced toxicity continue to be of interest for researchers given its ubiquitous nature and environmental distribution, where it often plays the role of pollutant for numerous organisms. The presence in the environment of this heavy metal has been constantly increasing because of its large employment in several industrial and agricultural activities. Cadmium does not have any biological role and, since it cannot be degraded by living organisms, it is irreversibly accumulated into cells, interacting with cellular components and molecular targets. Cadmium is one of the most studied heavy metal inductors of stress and a potent modulator of several processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, reactive oxygen species, protein kinase and phosphatase, mitochondrial function, metallothioneins, and heat-shock proteins. Sea urchins (adults, gametes, embryos, and larvae) offer an optimal opportunity to investigate the possible adaptive response of cells exposed to cadmium, since these cells are known to accumulate contaminants. In this review, we will examine several responses to stress induced by cadmium in different sea urchin species, with a focus on Paracentrotus lividus embryos. The sea urchin embryo represents a suitable system, as it is not subjected to legislation on animal welfare and can be easily used for toxicological studies and as a bioindicator of environmental pollution.

However, the female’s diet was found to significantly differ between months and depth zones. The diet varied within sex, the average dietary dissimilarities were 18.87% among males and 12.04% among females, possibly attributed to the sexual dimorphism and/or the size differences between sexes. The low variation (<16%) in the diet composition from shallow and deep water was most possibly related to migration of females to shallower waters during spring and summer and differences in benthic preys inhabiting the two depth zones studied. The high repletion index (%RI) values observed for females in late spring and summer and for males in autumn and winter could be associated with metabolic processes, such as reproduction and moulting.

Parasitism is ubiquitous in wildlife, and prevalence of parasitic infections as well as emerging diseases can be valuable bioindicators of the ecology and health of marine mammals. Collecting information about parasite diversity in marine mammals will provide a crucial baseline for assessing their impact on host and ecosystem ecology. New studies on marine mammals in New Zealand and Australian waters have recently added to our knowledge of parasite prevalence, life cycles and taxonomic relationships in the Australasian region, and justify a first host–parasite checklist encompassing all available data. The present checklist comprises 36 species of marine mammals, and 114 species of parasites (helminths, arthropods and protozoans). Mammal species occurring in New Zealand and Australian waters but not included in the checklist represent gaps in our knowledge.

Within it is the Port of Manila South Harbor, which receives international vessels that could carry non-indigenous macrofouling species. This study describes the species composition of the macrofouling community in South Harbor, Manila Bay during the northeast monsoon season. Nine fouler collectors designed by the North Pacific Marine Sciences Organization (PICES) were submerged in each of five sampling points in Manila Bay on 06 Oct 2017. Three collection plates from each of the five sites were retrieved every four weeks until 06 Feb 2018. Identification was done via morphological and CO1 gene analysis. A total of 18,830 organisms were classified into 17 families. For the first two months, <i>Amphibalanus amphitrite</i> was the most abundant taxon; in succeeding months, polychaetes became the most abundant. This shift in abundance was attributed to intraspecific competition within barnacles and the recruitment of polychaetes. Diversity and richness values increased across all sites, which are commonly observed in primary succession events, while evenness values were low due to the dominance of <i>Amphibalanus amphitrite</i> and polychaetes. New macrofouling species in Manila Bay were reported: <i>Barbatia foliata, Membranipora</i> sp., a stylochid flatworm, a venerid clam, and hesionid, phyllodocid, and cirratulid polychaetes. More importantly, non-indigenous species were observed: <i>Mytilopsis</i> sp., <i>Mytella charruana, Brachidontes pharaonis, Hydroides elegans</i>, and the North Pacific giant flatworm <i>Kaburakia excelsa</i>. These species are potentially invasive and may alter the ecosystem of Manila Bay. Thus, it is recommended to further monitor the seasonally variable macrofouling community of South Harbor to observe annual succession patterns and to use DNA barcoding techniques more extensively for identification of macrofoulers – especially the polychaete taxa – to the species level and rapid early detection of potentially invasive species.","Trinidad, C.B.; Valenzuela, R.L.G.; Ocampo, M.A.B.; Vallejo, B.M.",NULL,"Trinidad, C.B.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"biological invasion, DNA barcoding, fouling, species abundance, species diversity, species evenness, species composition",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Such sedimentary archives are excellent sources for environmental reconstructions and potentially suited to deliver a regional sea-level curve. We analysed a 4.6 m-long sediment core recovered south of the island of Norderney (East Frisia, Germany) using a multiproxy approach. The record comprises a vertical stack of changing sedimentary facies, including a basal peat and a second peat layer intercalated between marine sediments, which provides a sedimentological record of local coastal evolution since 7000 cal.

High-resolution stratigraphic, geochemical and paleobiological analyses enables reconstructing environmental variability in response to sea-level changes including a short-lived transgressive-regressive cycle.

Although the Northeast Pacific region of Canada (NEPC) is notable for having unique CWCS assemblages and is the location of >80% of Canadian seamounts, the extent of potential CWCS-defined VMEs in this region is unknown. Here, we used a diverse set of environmental data layers (n=30) representing a range of bathymetric derivatives, physicochemical variables, and water column properties to assess the primary factors influencing the niche separation and potential distributions of six habitat-forming groups of CWCS in the NEPC (sponge classes: Hexactinellida, Demospongiae; coral orders: Alcyonacea, Scleractinia, Antipatharia, Pennatulacea). The primary environmental gradients that influence niche separation among CWCS are driven by total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, and dissolved oxygen. Significant niche separation among groups indicates CWCS to be primarily specialists occurring in rare habitat conditions in the NEPC. Species distribution models (SDMs) developed for each CWCS group shared severely low dissolved oxygen levels ([O<sub>2</sub>] < 0.5 ml L<sup>−1</sup>) as a top predictor for habitat suitability in the NEPC. Niche separation is further emphasized by differences in the model-predicted areas of suitable habitat among CWCS groups. Although niches varied among taxa, the general areas of high habitat suitability for multiple CWCS groups in the NEPC occurred within the 500–1400 m bottom depth range which is strongly associated with the extensive oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) characterizing this region. As a result, the largest continuous area of potential CWCS habitat occurred along the continental slope with smaller, isolated patches also occurring at several offshore seamounts that have summits that extend into OMZ depths. Our results provide insight into the factors that influence the distributions of some of the most important habitat-forming taxa in the deep ocean and create an empirical foundation for supporting cold-water coral and sponge conservation in the NEPC.","Chu, J.W.F.; Nephin, J.; Georgian, S.; Knudby, A.; Rooper, C.; Gale, K.S.P.",WOS:000488141500002,"Chu, Jackson, J.W.F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2019.06.009,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,MaxEnt; Hypoxia; Basal metazoan; Oxygen requirements; Niche,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Besides their large numbers and abundance, marine microbial assemblages and their organic catalysts (enzymes) have a largely underestimated value for their use in the development of industrial products and processes.

The focus is on fisheries operated out of Thailand, supplemented by information about working conditions in fisheries based in Myanmar and Taiwan. A concept of frontier that pays attention to patterns in labour relations prior to intensification of state regulation enables consideration of how non‐state agents including vessel owners and captains, fishing technologies, marine ecologies, vessel mobilities, borders, and workers contribute to shaping working conditions in industrial fishing. This approach reframes current efforts to regulate industrial fisheries as acting not on an unregulated or lawless fisheries, but on a series of dynamic existing practices of involving multiple agents who regulate fisheries work in the relative absence of state regulation. Using this concept of the frontier also helps explain how and why labour relations in fisheries are positioned as exceptional in relation to terrestrial work, and draws attention to the way that state regulation works through owners and captains, often neglecting the agency of workers, or undermining worker agency through migration policies.","Vandergeest, P.",NULL,"Vandergeest, Peter, P.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/issj.12195,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL
