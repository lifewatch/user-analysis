He was one of those “natural born biologists” whose keen interest in biology became obvious when he was still a child and this interest developed into both profession and life-time passion. In 1976 Alexander graduated from one of the high schools in Moscow that had a specialization in biology and a year later he started his undergraduate studies at Biological Faculty of Moscow Lomonosov State University. He started doing research at the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy of Invertebrates as an undergraduate and that was the time when his scientific interests were determined, as both his Honors and Master’s projects were dedicated to polychaetes, the animals Sasha continued to study for the rest of his life. His diploma thesis was entitled “Ecology of <em>Janua </em>(<em>Dexiospira</em>)<em> nipponica </em>and <em>J. </em>(<em>D.</em>)<em> alveolata </em>(Polychaeta, Spirorbidae) near the southern shore of the Primorye and the morphology of their tubes”. Based on the results of these student projects Alexander published his first two research papers.","Kupriyanova, E.",NULL,"Kupriyanova, Elena, E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zoosymposia.19.1.8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We discuss the highly variable “signature” of diatoms within tsunami deposits and describe instances where clearly anomalous, allochthonous marine and brackish diatoms within tsunami deposits help support a marine incursion. We highlight how the fragmentation and sorting of diatom valves may provide evidence of high-energy transport during the rapid, turbulent flow of a tsunami; the potential use of diatoms to estimate tsunami runup beyond the landward limit of sedimentation; and the challenges in differentiating tsunami from storm deposits using diatoms.","Dura, T.; Hemphill-Haley, E.",NULL,"Hemphill-Haley, Eileen, E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-815686-5.00014-6,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Diatom field and laboratory methods; Diatom paleoecology; Diatom taxonomy; subduction zone paleoseismology; Tsunami deposits; Tsunami geology,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

The agricultural and tourist activities developed in the surroundings of the lagoon, together with the modifications in its channels of connection with the Mediterranean Sea, have notably affected the quality of its waters, which is altering the natural balance of the ecosystem. In this work, an analysis of the density of phytoplankton present in the lagoon between the months of May to December 2017 was carried out. The results indicate a significant increase in phytoplankton density between 2500 and 67,300 cells/mL compared to previous data of 1981 (between 10 and 500 cells/mL). Concentration of Chlorophyll-a arrives to 13 µg/L and transparency of water reduces to 1.3 m according to Secchi disk depth. The presence of Chlorophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and nanoplanktonic Cryptophyceae stands out, while species diversity drops significantly. Observing the evolution of the lagoon, we can deduce that eutrophication process could increase. To avoid this, it would be necessary to implement control measures for the use of fertilizers in nearby growing areas and to study water treatment techniques to reduce nitrogen inputs so that phytoplankton densities can decrease.","Soria, J.; Caniego, G.; Hernández-Sáez, N.; Dominguez-Gomez, J.A.; Erena, M.",WOS:000564595400001,"Soria, Juan, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/jmse8080600,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,coastal lagoon; phytoplankton; eutrophication; nanoplanktonic algae,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the present study, we studied the world distribution patterns of polychaetes based on datasets obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System and our recently published checklist of Indonesian polychaete species. Polychaete biogeographic regions were visualized using ‘Infomap Bioregions’, and the latitudinal species richness gradient of the animals was examined using 3 metrics, i.e. alpha, gamma and estimated species richness (the last metric was adjusted for sampling bias). We identified 11 major polychaete biogeographic regions. The North Atlantic, Australia and Indonesia were the top 3 species-rich biogeographic regions in the world. The total number of polychaete species was higher in the southern hemisphere (~2100 species, 67 families) than in the northern hemisphere (~1800 species, 75 families) despite significantly more data in the latter (>500000 records compared to >26000 records). Contrary to the classical idea of a unimodal distribution pattern, the latitudinal gradient of polychaetes was generally bimodal with a pronounced dip north of the Equator (15°N). We suggest that the slightly higher peak of species richness in the southern (30°S) than in the northern (60°N) hemisphere reflects higher southern endemicities. These patterns are unlikely to be due to sampling bias but rather represent a natural phenomenon, and we found them most significantly correlated with sea temperature.","Pamungkas, J.; Glasby, C.J.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000621345300010,"Pamungkas, Joko, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps13531,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Polychaeta,NULL,NULL,Global distribution · Latitudinal diversity gradient · Endemicity · Biodiversity · Polychaeta,Journal article,NULL,NULL

There is no clear relation between the changes of species structure of phytoplankton communities and water-bodies trophicity. The least significant changes in the phytoplankton community structure are registered for the mesoeutrophic Lake Ilmenskoe, which is located on the territory of the State Reserve. Diatomic, green and blue-green algae groups are the most diverse in composition in the studied periods of 1936-1937, 1964-1984 and 1998-2016. But for the last 20 years, Cyanophyta has increased its contribution into the phytoplankton number and biomass of Lake Ilmenskoe. The representatives of the <i>Bacillariophyta</i> group dominate in oligotrophic Lake Uvildy. In 1965-1985, the <i>Chlorophyta</i> group was the most abundant in Shershnevskoe reservoir (34 % of the total number of species), <i>Bacillariophyta</i> -32 % and <i>Cyanophyta</i> – 18 %. In 2003-2005 and 2017 the number of green algae increased (<i>Chlorophyta</i> – 40 %) and that of diatoms decreased (<i>Bacillariophyta</i> -21%) with the number of blue-green algae being unchanged (<i>Cyanophyta</i> -19 %). The ecological status of the Shershenevskoe Reservoir has transformed from a long-term sustainable mesotrophic to eutrophic. So, for oligotrophic lake Uvildy and mesoeutrophic lake Ilmenskoe, <i>Bacillariophyta</i> group is characterized by the greatest taxonomic diversity. While for eutrophic Shershnevskoe Reservoir the absolute abundance of <i>Chlorophyta</i> algae group is marked, which is growing in time. The growing importance of blue-green algae is one more feature of the change of a trophic status.","Kostryukova, A.; Mashkova, I.; Shchelkanova, E.; Trofimenko, V.",NULL,"Kostryukova, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1088/1755-1315/626/1/012008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Freshwater Cyclopoida also live in more freshwater sites than Calanoida. This could be a consequence of an invasion of freshwater by marine Cyclopoida before Calanoida. Similar to Cyclopoida, but different from marine Calanoida, freshwater Calanoida females produce egg sacs and care for eggs. This strategy is common among all freshwater plankton, suggesting that the evolution of parental care is an obliged adaption to conquer fresh water. Calanoida, different from Cyclopoida, survive adverse conditions as resting eggs. This life-cycle constraint obliges eggs to survive their mother’s death and wait in the benthos for a certain period. The necessity of completing embryonic development and the hatching of eggs far from the mother’s protection may be responsible for the relatively lower evolutionary success of Calanoida in fresh water compared to Cyclopoida (which rest as juveniles, thus protecting eggs in any moment of their development). Therefore, the brooding of eggs appears to be the obliged solution for Calanoida’s final establishment in fresh water, but the dispersion of eggs on the bottom after the mother’s death and during the rest period is probably the weak point in Calanoida’s competition with Cyclopoida.","Belmonte, G.",WOS:000606355300001,"Belmonte, Genuario, G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/w13010100,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Calanoida,NULL,NULL,adaption; brooding; parental care; Calanoida; freshwater zooplankton,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Quantitative samples were collected in the months of October 2013 and February 2014 at 15-m depth by scraping standard surfaces of 400 cm2. A total of 164 specific or supraspecific taxa were obtained and grouped into two categories: unitary and modular organisms.

For the modular organisms, 46 different taxa belonging to Porifera, Hydrozoa, Bryozoa, and Tunicata were identified. Modular organisms were studied only at a qualitative level. In soft thallus algae, a greater abundance of epibiont invertebrates was found, but with lower biomass than in calcareous algae, while the latter showed a greater species richness and Shannon-Wiener index. In general, we can conclude that the nature (soft or hard thallus) and architecture (branched or crusted) of the macroalgae can limit the size and abundance of the epibiont invertebrates and can condition the populations of organisms that settle in them.","Gallardo, D.; Oliva, F.; Ballesteros, M.",WOS:000609177200001,"Gallardo, David, D.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-020-01151-y,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Algae, ""Seaweeds""",NULL,Epibiont invertebrates; Marine algae; Abundance and biodiversity,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The main aim of this study was to determine whether waste products of aquaculture (such as detritus in the form of fish feces or <i>Ulva</i> sp.) provided an adequate diet for the amphipod in comparison to other traditional diets, such as <i>Artemia</i> nauplii or phytoplankton. <i>G. insensibilis</i> was cultured twice in tanks with 5 treatments: 4 experimental diets (detritus, <i>Ulva</i> sp., <i>Artemia</i> nauplii, and phytoplankton) were used, and one no-feed treatment. Amphipods fed with the two alternative diets, detritus and <i>Ulva</i>, showed promising survival higher than 40% and high concentrations of palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1n9), arachidonic acid (20:4n6) (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n3) (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3) (DHA). Therefore, large-scale culture of this amphipod using inexpensive diets in indoor facilities could provide a nutritious product for aquaculture.

In describing the latter from a single, poorly preserved specimen, zoologist Oskar Carlgren expressed apprehension with traits he had used to establish this species.

Crucial details to positively identify either species have since remained limited.

Individuals were observed to frequently propagate by longitudinal fission, resulting in a varied appearance.

However, while the taxonomic sufficiency of nematodes in detecting spatial gradients and related ecological niche conditions is well recognized, very little is known about nematodes functional morphometric attributes in response to environmental drivers. To explore this knowledge gap, we aimed to assess the efficacy and efficiency of nematode morphometric attributes (length, width, length/width ratio, biomass) in detecting spatial patterns along a Portuguese estuarine gradient, and compare it with the taxonomic approach. We hypothesized that abundance data weighted by the morphometric attributes will have a higher explanatory power in detecting spatial patterns than using abundance of morphometric data alone.Based on the recent recommendations regarding the time and cost related efficacy of methods in biomonitoring and ecological assessments we also hypothesized that a reduced dataset based on the most common genera will suffice to capture the same distributional patterns displayed by the whole assemblage.Our results demonstrated that dataset solely based on genera abundances had consistently better explanatory power than combined datasets or morphometric datasets alone, however, combined dataset provided different spatial patterns and performed better at discriminating estuary areas. The main gradients described by the taxonomy-based dataset were related to the sediment particle size and water depth. Considering combined datasets, spatial discrimination was mainly driven by the variation in dissolved oxygen % saturation, pointing out to the importance of this variable in determining estuarine conditions substantial for nematodes morphometric distributional patterns.The same analysis repeated for the most frequent genera resulted in similar distributional patterns as for the whole assemblage dataset, clearly demonstrating that spatial estuarine gradients can be sufficiently described by using only the most frequent genera.

Magelonids are characterised by a flattened, shovel-shaped prostomium and a pair of ventral papillated palps. Oweniids have simplified bodies lacking parapodia or appendages and are easily distinguished by the presence of oval patches of packed uncini, each with two distal curved teeth. The present review aims to summarise available information about the diversity of forms and life strategies displayed in the group, providing some guidelines for species identification and the techniques commonly used for their study. In addition, the assumed geographic distributions of some taxa are critically discussed.

These stations covered a near-offshore gradient from stations close to the mouth of the Scheldt estuary to most offshore stations. Significant differences of Chlorophyll-<em>a</em> (Chl-<em>a</em>) concentrations were observed between the two years with higher values in early spring 2018 (due to better light and nutrient conditions coupled to colder temperatures) and in summer 2018 (due to warmer conditions) compared to 2016. Nevertheless, the seasonal and spatial DMSP and DMSO (DMS(P,O)) patterns, as well as the yearly average were nearly identical in 2016 and 2018. This can be explained by the fact that the phytoplankton groups responsible for the large differences in Chl-<em>a</em> in 2018 and 2016 were low DMSP-producers characterized by several diatom and dinoflagellate species, occurring in early spring and summer. Further, the Prymnesiophyceae <em>Phaeocystis globosa</em>, occurring in late spring and responsible of most of DMS(P,O) measured in the area, reached similar biomass both years. The DMSP:Chl-<em>a</em> ratio obtained from the field measurements were similar to those previously published for the main observed phytoplankton groups, but more differences were observed for the DMSO:Chl-<em>a</em> ratio.

The area studied (characterized by a maximum tidal range of 2.3&nbsp;m) was subjected to diverse anthropogenic pressures: from the phosphate industry and its metallic pollution, unauthorized bottom trawling in shallow water (known locally as ‘Kiss’), and organic pollution from the nearby urbanized areas. A total of 23,506 invertebrates representing 311 taxa were collected. Dominant taxa were the polychaetes with 51.4% of the individuals collected and 39.3% of the taxa, the amphipods (18.6% and 15.5%), the tanaids (12.3% and 2.6%), and the molluscs (11.5% and 18.3%). The mean annual abundances varied widely from one channel to another: from 300 to 3700&nbsp;ind·m<sup>−2</sup>. The stations located in deeper waters exhibited greater variability. Measurements of abundance revealed seasonal changes with maximum values in winter, spring, and lower numbers in summer. Each tidal channel was characterized by specific features in the fauna. The macrofauna were dominated by the polychaete <em>Cirratulus cirratus</em> (mainly in spring) and the amphipod <em>Microdeutopus anomalus</em> (mainly in winter), whilst both of the tanaids, <em>Apseudopsis gabesi</em> (the first sighting reported for the area) and <em>A. mediterraneus</em>, were found to be abundant in winter in at least one of the four channels. Species are mainly deposit feeders, herbivorous and omnivorous.

The factors controlling the elemental composition of shells are discussed in the context of crystal lattice properties, size classes of organisms and potential environmental differences between locations. Clams that precipitate fully aragonitic shells have a clear predominance of Sr over Mg in shells, contrary to predominant accumulation of Mg over Sr in calcitic shells of barnacles. However, the barnacle calcite shell contains higher Sr concentration than bivalve aragonite. The elemental variability between size-grouped shells is different for each studied species, and the elemental concentrations tend to be lower in the large size classes compared to the smaller size classes. Biological differences between and within species, such as growth rate, feeding strategy (including feeding rate and assimilation efficiency or composition) and contribution of organic material, seem to be important factors determining the elemental accumulation in shells. Because specimens used in this study were obtained from different sampling sites within the gulf, the impact of location-specific environmental factors, such as sediment type, cannot be excluded.","Piwoni-Piórewicz, A.; Strekopytov, S.; Humphreys-Williams, E.; Kuklinski, P.",WOS:000614289000002,"Piwoni-Piórewicz, Anna, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-18-707-2021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Little is known about the effects of these sounds on free-ranging fish behavior. Effects reported range from subtle individual change in activity and swimming depth for captive fish to potential avoidance and changes in swimming velocity and diurnal activity patterns for free-swimming animals. However, the extent and duration of behavioral responses to seismic surveys remain largely unexplored for most fish species. In this study, we investigated the effect of a full-scale seismic survey on the movement behavior of free-swimming Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>). We found that cod did not leave the detection area more than expected during the experimental survey but that they left more quickly from 2 days to 2 weeks after the survey. Furthermore, during the exposure, cod decreased their activity, with time spent being “locally active” (moving small distances, showing high body acceleration) becoming shorter, and time spent being “inactive” (moving small distances, having low body acceleration) becoming longer. Additionally, diurnal activity cycles were disrupted with lower locally active peaks at dusk and dawn, periods when cod are known to actively feed. The combined effects of delayed deterrence and activity disruption indicate the potential for seismic surveys to affect energy budgets and to ultimately lead to population-level consequences.","van der Knaap, I.; Reubens, J.; Thomas, L.; Ainslie, M.A.; Winter, H.V.; Hubert, J.; Martin, B.; Slabbekoorn, H.",WOS:000640072800010,"Winter, Hendrik, H.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.050,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,Acoustic telemetry,NULL,"Atlantic cod, airgun array, good environmental status, hidden Markov models, noise pollution, movement behavior",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Ecosystems in this region are isolated by the Atacama Trench, the Humboldt Current System, and an extreme oxygen minimum zone. This isolation has produced a unique biodiversity that is marked by one of the highest levels of marine endemism on Earth. These areas also provide important habitats and ecological stepping stones for whales, sea turtles, corals, and a multitude of other ecologically important species, including 82 species that are threatened or endangered. Recent explorations in this region have documented one of the deepest light-dependent marine ecosystems on Earth, as well as numerous species that are new to science. Waters surrounding the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are mostly located in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), with smaller portions located in the national waters of Chile and Peru. Within this region, Chile has already protected all the ridge features that fall within its jurisdiction, and Peru is evaluating a proposal that would protect the seafloor that falls within its national waters. However, all of the ABNJ in the region, which cover over 73% of the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges, are unprotected and under threat from a variety of stressors, including climate change, plastic pollution, overfishing, and potential deep-sea mining in the future. Importantly, fishing and other commercial activities are at low levels in international waters of this region, so there is a time-sensitive opportunity to protect its unique natural and cultural resources before they are degraded. This study provides a synthesis of the relevant science that has been conducted on the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges, and discusses the opportunities and challenges for protecting this unique region via existing sectoral organizations and through the emerging international agreement on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). Given its exceptional natural and cultural significance, the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges should be comprehensively protected from exploitation, pollution and other anthropogenic threats using the best available conservation measures.","Wagner, D.; van der Meer, L.; Gorny, M.; Sellanes, J.; Gaymer, C.F.; Soto, E.H.; Easton, E.E.; Friedlander, A.M.; Lindsay, D.J.; Molodtsova, T.N.; Boteler, B.; Durussel, C.; Gjerde, K.M.; Currie, D.; Gianni, M.; Brooks, C.M.; Shiple, M.J.; Wilhelm, T.'A.; Quesada, M.; Thomas, T.; Dunstan, P.K.; Clark, N.A.; Villanueva, L.A.; Pyle, R.L.; Clark, M.R.; Georgian, S.E.; Morgan, L.E.",WOS:000632275200006,"Boteler, Ben, B.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104377,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Area-based management tools; Conservation planning; Sectoral bodies; Seamounts; Southeast Pacific; Vulnerable marine ecosystems,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards was developed for the land-based minerals industry and adapted in 2015 for ISA-managed nodules. Nodules can be sampled in a meaningful manner using mechanical devices, albeit with minor issues of bias.

Tonnage of resource is determined via the abundance of nodules in kilograms per square metre of seabed. This can be estimated from physical samples and, in some cases, from photographs. Contemporary resource reporting for nodules classify the level of confidence in the estimate, by considering deposit geology, sample geostatistics, etc. The reporting of estimates also addresses reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, including factors such as mining technology, the marine environment, metallurgical processing, and metals markets.

Bycatch risk is generally estimated by overlapping seabirds foraging ranges with coarse‐scale monthly maps of fishing efforts, but a more direct estimation would be the time birds actually spend attending fishing boats. Here we matched data from Automatic Identification Systems from all declared boats in the Southern Ocean, with 143 simultaneous foraging trips from all populations of large albatrosses (<i>Diomedea amsterdamensis</i> and <i>Diomedea exulans</i>) breeding in the Indian Ocean (Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Amsterdam islands). We quantified and compared real‐time co‐occurrence between boats and albatrosses, at different scales (100, 30 and 5 km). We also examined to what extent co‐occurrence at a large‐scale (5×5° grid cell) predicted fine‐scale attendance (5 km). Albatrosses on average spent about 3 h per trip attending fishing boats (<5 km) at both Amsterdam and Marion and about 30 h per trip at Kerguelen. In all populations, >90% of declared fishing boat attendances occurred within Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZ) where bycatch mitigation measures are enforced. Outside EEZs, birds from all populations to a large extent also attended non‐fishing boats. Fishing boat density at a large scale (5 × 5°, 100 km) was a poor predictor of time spent attending fishing boats (<5 km) across populations. Our results indicate a large variation in fishing boat densities within the foraging ranges of different populations and in the time birds spent attending boats. We discuss the pros and cons of considering bycatch risk at a large geographical scale and methods that can be implemented to improve the estimation of seabird vulnerability to fishing activities when fine‐scale data are available, particularly for the conservation of those highly threatened species.","Corbeau, A.; Collet, J.; Orgeret, F.; Pistorius, P.; Weimerskirch, H.",WOS:000614235900001,"Corbeau, A.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/acv.12676,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To address this, we compile data from research documenting plastic debris ingestion by marine fish, totaling 171,774 individuals of 555 species. Overall, 386 marine fish species have ingested plastic debris including 210 species of commercial importance. However, 148 species studied had no records of plastic consumption, suggesting that while this evolutionary trap is widespread, it is not yet universal. Across all studies that accounted for microplastics, the incidence rate of plastic ingested by fish was 26%. Over the last decade this incidence has doubled, increasing by 2.4 ± 0.4% per year. This is driven both by increasing detection of smaller sized particles as a result of improved methodologies, as well as an increase in fish consuming plastic. Further, we investigated the role of geographic, ecological, and behavioral factors in the ingestion of plastic across species. These analyses revealed that the abundance of plastic in surface waters was positively correlated to plastic ingestion. Demersal species are more likely to ingest plastic in shallow waters; in contrast, pelagic species were most likely to consume plastic below the mixed layer. Mobile predatory species had the highest likelihood to ingest plastic; similarly, we found a positive relationship between trophic level and plastic ingestion. We also find evidence that surface ingestion‐deep sea egestion of microplastics by mesopelagic myctophids is likely a key mechanism for the export of microplastics from the surface ocean to the seafloor, a sink for marine debris. These results elucidate the role of ecology and biogeography underlying plastic ingestion by marine fish and point toward species and regions in urgent need of study.","Savoca, M.S.; McInturf, A.G.",WOS:000616363200001,"McInturf, Alexandra, A.G.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.15533,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Renewables, particularly wind and solar power, will be predominant components of this transition. How availability of the wind and solar resource will change in the future in response to regional climate changes is an important and underdiscussed topic of the decarbonization process. Here, we study changes in potential for wind power in China and India, evaluating prospectively until the year 2060. To do this, we study a downscaled, high-resolution multimodel ensemble of CMIP5 models under high and low emissions scenarios. While there is some intermodel variability, we find that spatial changes are generally consistent across models, with decreases of up to 965 (a 1% change) and 186 TWh (a 2% change) in annual electricity generation potential for China and India, respectively. Compensating for the declining resource are weakened seasonal and diurnal variabilities, allowing for easier large-scale wind power integration. We conclude that while the ensemble indicates available wind resource over China and India will decline slightly in the future, there remains enormous potential for significant wind power expansion, which must play a major role in carbon neutral aspirations.","Sherman, P.J.; Song, S.; Chen, X.; McElroy, M.B.",WOS:000625101200001,"Chen, Xinyu, X.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1088/1748-9326/abe57c,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The volume of the ice, area and extent have been declining in recent years. The inflow of the Atlantic Ocean water into Arctic Ocean have made changes including the weaker stratification. Moreover, shoaling of Atlantic water in Eurasian Basin reduced sea ice and accelerate the Atlantic water layers’ heat fluxes further Northeast into Eurasian Basin. The salty water (denser than fresh water), the melting of sea ice and warming of Arctic Ocean surface are causing the density of water to change as well as the variations in ocean mass. These huge amounts of the mass variations lead the variations of the Earth gravity field that are being monitored by satellite gravimetry. The main objective of this thesis is to estimate and analyse ocean mass variations in the Arctic Ocean and all seas around namely Laptev Sea, Kara Sea, Barents Sea, Green Land Sea, Baffin Bay, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea and East Siberian Sea. For this purpose, the standard GRACE level-2 data product from GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), Potsdam and the Centre for Space Research (CSR) from University of Texas has been used to estimate the ocean masses. Moreover, the Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) data from satellite altimetry was used for further analysis of the trend in the Arctic region computed from GRACE data. The SLA data is provided by Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Results show that the Beaufort Sea has experienced the highest positive trend in ocean mass of 9.99 mm/year and SLA of approximately 10 mm/year. The positive trends are influenced by the presence of Beaufort Gyre which the anticyclone winds accumulate the fresh water and deeper in this region there are cold and salty water from Pacific Ocean. The Chukchi Sea has positive trend in ocean mass of 7.64 mm/year and Sea Level Anomaly trend range from −1 mm/year and 1 mm/year. The positive trends are influenced by Pacific Ocean water which are warmer and saltier. The Baffin Bay has the strongest negative trend in ocean mass of −59.59 mm/year and Sea Level anomaly trend of approximately −9 mm/year. These negative trends are caused by the Gravitation attraction of Greenland masses and the Arctic Ocean freshwater outflows through it on the way to North Atlantic Ocean. The Hudson Bay have positive trend in ocean mass of 0.35 mm/year and Sea Level Anomaly trend ranges from 1 to 3 mm/year. The positive trends are due to large input of fresh water from river and precipitation, ice melting influenced by air temperature and inflow of Arctic Ocean waters. The Greenland Sea has negative trend in ocean mass of −9.10 mm/year and Sea Level Anomaly trend ranges between −1 mm/year and 6 mm/year. The negative trend is influenced by Gravitational attraction of Greenland masses or due to freshwater outflow from the Arctic Ocean through western side of Fram Strait. Barents Sea has positive trend in ocean mass of 0.13 mm/year and Sea Level Anomaly trend ranging from −1 mm/year to 7 mm/year. Kara Sea has positive trend in ocean mass of 3.73 mm/year, Laptev Sea has positive trend in ocean mass of 6.83 mm/year, East Siberian Sea has a positive trend of 8.25 mm/year and Arctic Ocean has positive ocean mass trend of 5.83 mm/year. The positive trends in this region are influenced by the so-called Atlantification of Arctic Ocean. The Kara Sea, Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea all have negative trends in Sea Level Anomaly ranging from −2 mm/year to −6 mm/year. The negative trends are influenced by the gain of fresh water, net precipitation, run off increased and more discharge from the land to the sea water.","Daud Gisiri, T.",NULL,"Daud Gisiri, Thomas, T.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.18419/opus-11281,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA

The IoUT technology is intricately linked with intelligent boats and ships, smart shores and oceans, automatic marine transportations, positioning and navigation, underwater exploration, disaster prediction and prevention, as well as with intelligent monitoring and security. The IoUT has an influence at various scales ranging from a small scientific observatory, to a mid-sized harbor, and to covering global oceanic trade. The network architecture of IoUT is intrinsically heterogeneous and should be sufficiently resilient to operate in harsh environments. This creates major challenges in terms of underwater communications, whilst relying on limited energy resources. Additionally, the volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT is enormous, giving rise to the concept of Big Marine Data (BMD), which has its own processing challenges. Hence, conventional data processing techniques will falter, and bespoke Machine Learning (ML) solutions have to be employed for automatically learning the specific BMD behavior and features facilitating knowledge extraction and decision support. The motivation of this paper is to comprehensively survey the IoUT, BMD, and their synthesis. It also aims for exploring the nexus of BMD with ML. We set out from underwater data collection and then discuss the family of IoUT data communication techniques with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art research challenges. We then review the suite of ML solutions suitable for BMD handling and analytics. We treat the subject deductively from an educational perspective, critically appraising the material surveyed. Accordingly, the reader will become familiar with the pivotal issues of IoUT and BMD processing, whilst gaining an insight into the state-of-the-art applications, tools, and techniques. Finally, we analyze the architectural challenges of the IoUT, followed by proposing a range of promising direction for research and innovation in the broad areas of IoUT and BMD. Our hope is to inspire researchers, engineers, data scientists, and governmental bodies to further progress the field, to develop new tools and techniques, as well as to make informed decisions and set regulations related to the maritime and underwater environments around the world.","Jahanbakht, M.; Xiang, W.; Hanzo, L.; Azghadi, M.R.",WOS:000654905700009,"Jahanbakht, Mohammad, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1109/comst.2021.3053118,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Internet of Things , Big Data , Underwater Network Architecture , Data Acquisition , Marine and Underwater Databases/Datasets , Underwater Wireless Sensor Network , Image and Video Processing , Machine Learning , Deep Neural Networks",Journal article,NULL,NULL

The methodology presented here addresses this research need. It employs analytical hierarchy process and pairwise comparison methods in a geographical information systems environment. Publicly available land use, infrastructure and transport data are used to exclude areas unsuitable for development due to physical and safety constraints. Meteorological and oceanic opportunities are ranked and then competing uses are analyzed to deliver optimal sites for wind farms. The potential annual wind energy yield is calculated by dividing the sum of optimal areas by a suitable turbine footprint to deliver maximum turbine number. In total, 10 favourable wind farm areas were identified in Bahrain’s territorial waters, representing about 4% of the total maritime area, and capable of supplying 2.68 TWh/year of wind energy or almost 10% of the Kingdom’s annual electricity consumption. Detailed maps of potential sites for offshore wind construction are provided in the article, giving an initial plan for installation in these locations.","Elgabiri, M.; Palmer, D.; Al Buflasa, H.; Thomson, M.",WOS:000623426900001,"Elgabiri, Mohamed, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1177/0309524x20925399,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Offshore wind farm siting, suitability maps, geographical information systems, multi-criteria, analytic hierarchy process, offshore wind energy potential",Journal article,NULL,NULL

For example, the presence of larger phytoplankton cells supports food chains that ultimately contribute to fisheries resources. Monitoring these indicators can thus provide important information to help understand the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change. In this study, we apply the phytoplankton size model of Gittings et al. (2019b) to 20-years of satellite-derived ocean colour observations in the northern and central Red Sea, and investigate interannual variability in phenology metrics for large phytoplankton (&gt;2 µm in cell diameter). Large phytoplankton consistently bloom in the winter. However, the timing of bloom initiation and termination (in autumn and spring, respectively) varies between years. In the autumn/winter of 2002/2003, we detected a phytoplankton bloom, which initiated ~8 weeks earlier and lasted ~11 weeks longer than average. The event was linked with an eddy dipole in the central Red Sea, which increased nutrient availability and enhanced the growth of large phytoplankton. The earlier timing of food availability directly impacted the recruitment success of higher trophic levels, as represented by the maximum catch of two commercially important fisheries (<span class=""html-italic"">Sardinella</span> spp. and <span class=""html-italic"">Teuthida</span>) in the following year. The results of our analysis are essential for understanding trophic linkages between phytoplankton and fisheries and for marine management strategies in the Red Sea.","Gittings, J.A.; Brewin, R.J.W.; Hoteit, I.",WOS:000611547200001,"Hoteit, Ibrahim, I.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs13020231,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,phytoplankton; size structure; phenology; ocean colour; remote sensing; red sea; fisheries,Journal article,NULL,NULL

As more and more evidence highlights, microplastics and polluting chemicals are intertwined via adsorption/desorption processes. A thorough assessment of their total impact on marine ecosystems thus requires that these two kinds of pollution are not considered separately. Here we compare the outcomes of two complementary, data-driven modelling approaches for microplastic dispersal and for Plastic-Related Organic Pollutants (PROPs) in the marine environment. Focusing on the Mediterranean Sea, we simulate two years of Lagrangian particle tracking to map microplastic dispersion from the most impacting sources of pollution (i.e. coastal areas, the watersheds of major rivers, and fishing activities). Our particle sources are data-informed by national census data, hydrological regimes, and vessel tracking data to account for spatial and temporal variability of mismanaged plastic waste generation. These particle-based simulations are complemented with a simulation of the dynamics of primary pollutants in the sea, obtained via an advection-diffusion Eulerian model. While providing further understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics and the dynamics of PROPs at a Mediterranean-wide scale, our results call for the development of novel integrated modelling approaches aimed at coupling the dynamics of microplastics with the chemical exchanges occurring through them, thus promoting a holistic description of marine plastic pollution.","Guerrini, F.; Mari, L.; Casagrandi, R.",NULL,"Guerrini, Federica, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145944,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Microplastics; Marine pollution; Advection-diffusion; Oceanographic reanalyses,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To address this issue, here we developed a conservation planning framework to prioritize highly protected MPAs in places that would result in multiple benefits today and in the future. We find that a substantial increase in ocean protection could have triple benefits, by protecting biodiversity, boosting the yield of fisheries and securing marine carbon stocks that are at risk from human activities.

Species of Phyllodocida are mainly found in the marine benthos, although a few inhabit freshwater, terrestrial and planktonic environments, and occur from intertidal to deep waters in all oceans. In this review, we (1) explore the current knowledge on species diversity trends (based on traditional species concept and molecular data), phylogeny, ecology, and geographic distribution for the whole group, (2) try to identify the main knowledge gaps, and (3) focus on selected families: Alciopidae, Goniadidae, Glyceridae, Iospilidae, Lopadorrhynchidae, Polynoidae, Pontodoridae, Nephtyidae, Sphaerodoridae, Syllidae, Tomopteridae, Typhloscolecidae, and Yndolaciidae. The highest species richness is concentrated in European, North American, and Australian continental shelves (reflecting a strong sampling bias). While most data come from shallow coastal and surface environments most world oceans are clearly under-studied. The overall trends indicate that new descriptions are constantly added through time and that less than 10% of the known species have molecular barcode information available.","Martin, D.; Aguado, M.T.; Fernández-Álamo, M.A.; Britayev, T.A.; Böggemann, M.; Capa, M.; Faulwetter, S.; Fukuda, M.V.; Helm, C.; Petti, M.A.V.; Ravara, A.; Teixeira, M.A.L.",WOS:000633574300001,"Fukuda, Marcelo, M.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d13030131,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,Polychaeta,NULL,NULL,polychaetes; species diversity; molecular diversity; phylogeny; ecology; distribution,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Understanding species' connectivity can reveal how nations share resources, demonstrating the need for cooperative protection efforts. Unfortunately, connectivity information is rarely integrated into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). This is exemplified in the Red Sea where biodiversity is only nominally protected by a non-cohesive network of small-sized MPAs, most of which are barely implemented. Here, we showcase the potential of using connectivity patterns of flagship species to consolidate conservation efforts in the Red Sea. We argue that a large-scale MPA (LSMPA) would more effectively preserve Red Sea species' multinational migration routes. A connectivity-informed LSMPA approach provides thus one avenue to unite coastal nations toward acting for the common good of conservation and reverse the global decline in marine biodiversity.","Gajdzik, L.; Green, A.L.; Cochran, J.E.M.; Hardenstine, R.S.; Tanabe, L.K.; Berumen, M.L.",WOS:000648436000002,"Green, Alison, A.L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112244,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Marine protected area; Coastal development; Coral reef; Fish; Whale shark; Sea turtle,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In these areas, lack of effective regulation and the often high importance of the marine environment in providing food and economic opportunities, together create conditions where marine resources and habitats come under unsustainable levels of pressure.

Four hundred houses were visited in each of the four selected communes (N’Djili, Mont Ngafula, Lingwala and Kalamu). Within the peri-domestic area of each household, searches were conducted for larval habitats, which were then surveyed for the presence of <i>Aedes</i> larvae and pupae.

The BI was 21.5 (4.7), 36.7 (9.8) and 41.7 (7.5) in Kalamu, Lingwala and N’Djili in the rainy (and dry) season, respectively. The house index (number of houses positive for at least one container with immature stages of <i>Aedes</i> spp<i>.</i> per 100 inspected houses) was, on average, across all communes, 27.5% (7.6%); and the container index (number of containers positive for immature stages of <i>Aedes </i>spp<i>.</i> per 100 inspected containers) was 15.0% (10.0%) for the rainy (and dry) season, respectively. The vast majority of <i>Aedes</i>-positive containers were found outside the houses [adjusted odds ratio 27.4 (95% confidence interval 14.9–50.1)]. During the dry season, the most productive containers were the ones used for water storage, whereas in the rainy season rubbish and tires constituted key habitats.

In addition to the population located at Natoye, Belgium, locally established since 2002, specimens were recently collected along the Belgian border. The first objective of this study was therefore to investigate the origin of these new introductions, which were assumed to be related to the expansion of the nearby population in western Germany. Also, an intensive elimination campaign was undertaken at Natoye between 2012 and 2015, after which the species was declared to be eradicated. This species was re-detected in 2017, and thus the second objective was to investigate if these specimens resulted from a new introduction event and/or from a few undetected specimens that escaped the elimination campaign.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Methods</h3><p>Population genetic variation at <i>nad</i>4 and seven microsatellite loci was surveyed in 224 and 68 specimens collected in Belgium and Germany, respectively.

Also, the population after 2017 displayed an increased allelic richness and number of private alleles, indicative of new introduction(s). However, the Natoye population present before the elimination programme is believed to have survived at low density. At the Belgian border, clustering results suggest a relation with the western German population. Whether the introduction(s) occur via passive human-mediated ground transport or, alternatively, by natural spread cannot be determined yet from the dataset.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusion</h3><p>Further introductions within Belgium are expected to occur in the near future, especially along the eastern Belgian border, which is at the front of the invasion of <i>Ae. japonicus</i> towards the west.

Their large range in land use intensity significantly impacts their ecological value and the balance between these goods and services. Mowing dates and frequencies are major aspects of grassland use intensity, which have an impact on their ecological value as habitats. Previous studies highlighted the feasibility of detecting mowing events based on remote sensing time series, a few of which using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Although providing encouraging results, research on grassland mowing detection often lacks sufficient precise reference data for corroboration. The goal of the present study is to quantitatively and statistically assess the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR for detecting mowing events in various agricultural grasslands, using a large and diverse reference data set collected in situ. Several mowing detection methods, based on SAR backscattering and interferometric coherence time series, were thoroughly evaluated. Results show that 54% of mowing events could be detected in hay meadows, based on coherence jumps. Grazing events were identified as a major confounding factor, as most false detections were made in pastures. Parcels with one mowing event in the summer were identified with the highest accuracy (71%). Overall, this study demonstrates that mowing events can be detected through Sentinel-1 coherence. However, the performances could probably be further enhanced by discriminating pastures beforehand and combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for mowing detection.","De Vroey, M.; Radoux, J.; Defourny, P.",WOS:000615519300001,"Defourny, Pierre, P.","Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs13030348,NULL,Lifewatch acknowledged,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,grassland; mowing detection; Sentinel-1; backscattering; coherence; land use intensity,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this paper, we show that in tropical Atlantic countries, such as Brazil and Senegal, examples of ocean grabbing already occur. In this context, we analyse if Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) may be an opportunity to limit ocean grabbing or, to the contrary, poses a risk to increase it. MSP calls for an ecosystem approach that requires integrated coastal and marine management and involves stakeholders in developing a shared vision of the future, where society and environment are preserved. However, recent studies have shown that MSP is a process to be used cautiously to ensure equitable decisions. Meanwhile, the concept is spreading worldwide including in tropical Atlantic countries. We highlight that context matters and the specificities of the tropical Atlantic must be taken into account when deploying MSP processes. In the tropical Atlantic context, there is increased imbalances of stakeholder power, traps from decision support tools, and a need for adaptive management. These specific features must be addressed when deploying MSP in a way to avoid ocean grabbing.","Queffelec, B.; Bonnin, M.; Ferreira, B.; Bertrand, S.; Teles Da Silva, S.; Diouf, F.; Trouillet, B.; Cudennec, A.; Brunel, A.; Billant, O.; Toonen, H.",NULL,"Bertrand, Sophie, S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icesjms/fsab006,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Spatio‐temporal patterns of industrial fisheries in developing countries are often poorly understood, with global efforts describing spatial patterns of fishing vessel activity currently based on automatic identification system (AIS) data. However, AIS is often not a legal requirement on fishing vessels, likely resulting in underestimates of the scale and distribution of legal and illegal fishing activity, which could have significant ramifications for targeted enforcement efforts and the management of fisheries resources. To help address this knowledge gap, we analysed three years of vessel monitoring system (VMS) data in partnership with the national fisheries department in the Republic of the Congo to describe the behaviour of national and distant water industrial fleets operating in these waters. We reveal the spatial footprint of the industrial fisheries fleet encompasses over one quarter of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), with an average of 73% of fishing activity taking place on the continental shelf (waters shallower than 200 m). In addition, our findings highlight that VMS is not acting as a deterrent or being effectively used as a pro‐active management tool, with as much as 33% (13% on average) of fishing effort occurring within prohibited areas set aside to protect biodiversity, including artisanal fisheries resources; with the distant water fleet (DWF) responsible for as much as 84% of this illegal activity. Given the growth in industrial and distant water fleets across the region, as well as low levels of management and enforcement, these findings highlight that there is an urgent need for the global community to help strengthen regional and national capacity to analyse national scale datasets if efforts to combat IUU fishing are to be effective.","Doherty, P.D.; Atsango, B.C.; Ngassiki, G.; Ngouembe, A.; Bréheret, N.; Chauvet, E.; Godley, B.J.; Machin, L.; Moundzoho, B.D.; Parnell, R.J.; Metcalfe, K.",WOS:000649339700001,"Doherty, Philip, P.D.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/cobi.13723,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

It only requires the collection of sufficient information, establishment of databases and input of human and capital resources for analysis. However, many countries are unable to effectively ensure the sustainable development of marine fisheries due to technological limitations. The main challenge is the gap in the conditions for sustainable development between developed and developing countries. Therefore, this study applied the Web of Science database and geographic information systems to analyze the gaps in fisheries science in various countries over the past 10 years. Most studies have been conducted in the offshore marine areas of the northeastern United States of America. In addition, all research hotspots were located in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating a lack of relevant studies from the Southern Hemisphere. This study also found that research hotspots of satellite RS applications in fisheries were mainly conducted in (1) the northeastern sea area in the United States, (2) the high seas area of the North Atlantic Ocean, (3) the surrounding sea areas of France, Spain and Portugal, (4) the surrounding areas of the Indian Ocean and (5) the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay sea areas to the north of Taiwan. A comparison of publications examining the three major oceans indicated that the Atlantic Ocean was the most extensively studied in terms of RS applications in fisheries, followed by the Indian Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean was less studied than the aforementioned two regions. In addition, all research hotspots were located in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating a lack of relevant studies from the Southern Hemisphere. The Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean have been the subjects of many local in-depth studies; in the Pacific Ocean, the coastal areas have been abundantly investigated, while offshore local areas have only been sporadically addressed. Collaboration and partnership constitute an efficient approach for transferring skills and technology across countries. For the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, research networks can be expanded to mitigate the research gaps and improve the sustainability of marine fisheries resources.","Yen, K.-W.; Chen, C.-H.",WOS:000628491900001,"Yen, Kuo-Wei, K.-W.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs13051013,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,remote sensing; fisheries; sustainability; research gaps; sustainable development goals (SDGs),Journal article,NULL,NULL

Due to the growing interest in marine resources, the need to regulate the global maritime space has become a major requirement, being necessary to guarantee its precise delineation of the correspondent maritime zones. This evidence determined the scope of this work, which has a theoretical component and a practical component. The theoretical component regards to the description of the maritime zones, including some of the analysis methods used for delimitation in maritime zones, and the practical component focuses on the methods for delimitation of bilateral maritime boundaries over existent overlapping areas. The final product of this research regards to the development of a tool, a plugin for QGIS developed in Python, composed of three main scripts to automate the delineation process. The first script Implements the equidistance method for being the base method and most consensual approach for delineation of maritime boundaries. The second and third scripts implement the equity method. This method allows to adjust the delineation under certain specific circumstances. These latter developed scripts are complementary, allowing to generate several scenarios based on technical criteria that justify the considered options. The developed tool was applied to the case study of Portugal, which shares maritime limits with Spain and Morocco. It was identified three main areas of analysis, and it was generated several scenarios in these areas. This benchmark test demonstrates the potential of the developed tool, especially as a supportive instrument in the politicaldiplomatic negotiations between States concerning the delimitation of their maritime borders.","Henriques, G.M.M.",NULL,"Henriques, Guida, G.M.M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

This ice formed over the ocean plays a crucial role in the global climate system. Most of the solar radiation which is incident on sea ice is reflected, and thus, it acts as the earth’s polar refrigerator by limiting the heat absorption. However, it is found over the decades that sea ice is declining dramatically, and this can cause various negative impacts. Firstly, the warming up of the poles disrupts the earth’s overall heat flow, and secondly, it alters the wind pattern by pushing more ice towards the Atlantic. The study aims at extracting the rate of growth and attainment of sea ice over various seas of the Arctic region. The seas mainly considered for the purpose of study are East Siberian, Kara and Barents. Using sea ice thickness data from NSIDC, for the year 2012–13 and 2018–19, various episodes of sea ice thickness over the region are distinctly identified and compared with each other. It is found that the fluctuation in sea ice thickness is different for each sea mainly due to its topography. Despite the cool nature of the Arctic, it is also found that unexpected warmth comes beneath the Arctic Ocean because of the high heat capacity of water, which in turn serves as the causative factor for mild climates in the coastal regions. On the contrary, land has a lower heat capacity, so it gets heated up quickly during the day and cools down with dawn. Not only the heat capacity factor but also other parameters such as pressure, temperature, wind, humidity and its related precipitation also contribute to the variation in sea ice thickness","Panicker, D.V.; Vachharajani, B.; Ram Rajak, D.",NULL,"Panicker, Dency, D.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-981-15-9953-8_21,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""","Barents Sea, ""Kara Sea""",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Sea ice thickness, East Siberian, NSIDC ",Book chapters,Conference paper,NULL

The sparse information available, mainly for seamounts outside Chilean jurisdiction and shallow-water fauna of the Desventuradas Islands, suggests that the area is a hotspot of endemism. This apparent uniqueness of the fauna motivated the creation of the large Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park (NDMP, ~ 300,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around the small islands San Felix and San Ambrosio in 2015. We report for the first time a detailed description of benthic microhabitats (i.e., centimeter to meter scale), macrohabitats (i.e., meter to kilometer-scale) and associated megafauna within the NDMP. Descriptions were based on analysis of fauna collected by trawling and ROV video observations from ~ 50 to 370 m depth. Rocky, coarse sand and silty sediment bottom habitats were observed at island slopes. In contrast, rocky and coarse sandy bottom habitats with a predominance of rhodoliths, thanatocoenosis, and other biogenic components were observed at seamounts. Mobile fauna and predators dominated the oceanic islands and nearby seamounts, whereas seamounts farther from the islands were dominated by sessile and hemisessile fauna that were mainly suspension and deposit feeders. Based on the register of 118 taxonomic units, our results provide an expanded and updated baseline for the benthic biodiversity of NDMP habitats, which seemed pristine, without evidence of trawling or anthropogenic debris.","Tapia-Guerra, J.M.; Mechó, A.; Easton, E.E.; de los Ángeles Gallardo, M.; Gorny, M.; Sellanes, J.",NULL,"de los Ángeles Gallardo, María, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-021-85516-8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here, we evaluated the contribution of each receiver within two APT designs to the number of tag signals detected and the position accuracy of free-ranging Atlantic cod, through data exclusion of single receivers from the analysis. The two APTs were deployed around offshore (ca 50&nbsp;km) wind turbines at which 27 individual cod were tagged.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Results</h3><p>We found that the exclusion of data from an APT receiver that was positioned within the movement area of the individual fish reduced the number of tag signals detected and the position accuracy of the set-up the most. Excluding the data from a single receiver caused a maximum of 34% positions lost per fish and a maximum increase in core area of 97.8%. Single-receiver data exclusion also caused a potentially large bias in the reconstruction of swimming tracks. By contrast, exclusion of a receiver that was deployed within 50&nbsp;m from a turbine actually improved fish position accuracy, probably because the turbine can cause signal interference as a reflective barrier.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusions</h3><p>We recommend that an exploratory small-scale study like the one presented here be conducted before embarking on a larger-scale APT study. By excluding the data of single receivers from the positioning analysis, we were able to explore the suitability of a receiver set-up for the movement patterns of our target species. Furthermore, when a receiver is lost from an APT during deployment, the data should be treated with care as our results show that changes in triangulation outcome can lead to considerable differences in swimming tracks and home range estimates.","Van der Knaap, I.; Slabbekoorn, H.; Winter, H.V.; Moens, T.; Reubens, J.",NULL,"Winter, Hendrik, H.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40317-021-00238-y,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Acoustic telemetry, Position triangulation, Behaviour, Atlantic cod, Offshore structures, Wind power",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Thus, the influence of macrobenthic coverage on the diversity and assemblage structure of the harpacticoid copepod fauna was investigated in the rocky shores of a Marine Protect Area (MPA) in the Ligurian Sea (NW, Mediterranean Sea). Two sampling sites were investigated in two seasons at three different depths on both sub-vertical and inclined reefs. A total of 61 species of copepods mainly represented by Miraciidae, Laophontidae, Longipediidae and Thalestridae were found. The complex micro-topography of these substrata provided a wide variety of niches for many species with different lifestyles that suggests the important role of rocky shores to ensure the functioning of coastal ecosystems. The harpacticoid assemblage structure seemed mainly influenced by season and depth. The temporal spread observed is likely one of the underlying mechanisms of niche segregation that allows many species to co-occur in this specific environment along with a subordinate spatial segregation corresponding to the depth gradient. The results seem to support the hypothesis that the different species composition of the “ecosystem engineer” (and consequently its structure changes) are relevant in structuring the copepod assemblages. The comparison with previous data on general meiofauna underlines that higher surrogacy of the taxonomic identification could be used to study rocky shore communities, but the rich diversity that these systems host can only be understood at the lower taxonomic levels. The same holds for future evaluations of impact of environmental changes (including MPA regulations) on meiofaunal assemblages.","Sbrocca, C.; De Troch, M.; Losi, V.; Grassi, E.; Balsamo, M.; Semprucci, F.",WOS:000644959800001,"De Troch, Marleen, M.","Biology Department, Ghent University, Marine Biology",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/w13081020,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Ligurian Sea,Copepoda,Macrobenthos,NULL,ecosystem engineers; Ligurian Sea; NW Mediterranean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

LFI is generally defined as immobile near-shore ice that remains fast along the coast and forms seaward from the land. It affects the coastline dynamics, is important for the near-shore ecosystems, wildlife, and human socio-economic activities. A method is proposed for mapping the LFI using time series of 10-day clear-sky composites derived at the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m imagery. The delineation of coastal zone ice utilizes simultaneous analysis of the mean and standard deviation of MODIS monthly reflectance maps. The application of this method is demonstrated for a 20-year period (2000–2019) over the coastal zone of Banks Island in the Beaufort Sea. Detailed analyses have been conducted for three LFI parameters: (1) the total area (spatial extent) occupied by LFI; (2) the distance from the coast to the outer seaward LFI edge, and (3) the water depth at the outer seaward LFI edge. Comparison with the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) data demonstrates good agreement. The average correlation coefficients between CIS and CCRS time series in April-June, when the area reaches a maximum, are equal to 0.87–0.88. The mean differences (CIS-CCRS) are 344 km<sup>2</sup> (5,464 km<sup>2</sup> vs 5,120 km<sup>2</sup>) or 6.3% for the spatial extent; 1.3 km (17.6 km vs 16.3 km) or 7.4% for the distance; −2.7 m (−27.4 m vs −24.7 m) or 10% for the water depth. Because the CCRS method uses monthly statistics, it tends to exclude potentially more mobile continuous landfast ice zones than the CIS analysis which is based on data collected on a specific date. The long-term trends of the LFI seasonal cycle in our region of interest since 2000 have shown a tendency for an earlier break-up, later onset, and longer ice-free period; however, these trends are not statistically significant.","Trishchenko, A.P.; Luo, Y.",WOS:000641804300001,"Trishchenko, Alexander, A.P.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/07038992.2021.1909466,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Comparative analysis of shell composition, fragmentation, and accumulation highlights similarities despite the different cultural and environmental contexts of the two case studies.

Climate change and rising sea surface temperatures are likely to induce biogeographical range shifts and phenological changes for all zooplankton species, which include copepods. Consequently, consistent time-series are fundamental to monitor the status of plankton communities and predict future changes that can greatly affect the whole food-chain. Here, a recent time series (2014–2020) of image-based copepod abundance data from the Belgian Part of the North Sea has been explored and compared with previously collected (2009–2010) microscopy-based datasets for the same study area. The time series revealed distinct discrepancies in copepod phenology, abundances and total biomass between nearshore and offshore regions. The nearshore area was characterised by an altered copepod dynamics through time, with the occurrence of a single annual spring peak in both abundance and total biomass, and no autumn peak usually described and present in that area. Conversely, the autumn peak was clearly observed at the offshore stations, together with a distinct additional early spring peak in comparison to the nearshore and midshore regions which has not been documented before. Remarkable anomalies were detected within the time-serie of copepod for both abundance and biomass, notably in autumn of 2018 and in a lesser extend in 2014 and 2019, with values dropping to near-zero for the nearshore stations. The various heat waves during the summer periods of these years are considered potential causes for these copepod decreases, since they corresponded to the physiological thermal limit of many copepods species known to be present in the area. These heat waves events could have also favoured predators of copepods such as jellyfishes as well as enhancing the occurrence of d harmful algal blooms. Both anomalies in 2018 and 2019 actually coincided with important phytoplankton autumn blooms. The results from this copepod time-series analysis illustrates the changes affecting this essential marine trophic level and highlights the value and relevance of copepod long-term data series in the context of climate change and ecosystem management.","Mortelmans, J.; Aubert, A.; Reubens, J.; Otero, V.; Deneudt, K.; Mees, J.",WOS:000656425200002,"Aubert, Anaïs, A.",Flanders Marine Institute,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103558,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",Belgium,NULL,"Time series, ""Zooplankton""",NULL,Copepods; ZooScan; Belgian part of the North Sea; Climate change; Image recognition,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, few studies have formally projected how their seasonal marine habitat may shift in response to warming ocean temperatures. Here we used a high-resolution global climate model and a large satellite tagging dataset to project changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for loggerheads along the northeastern continental shelf of the United States. Between 2009 and 2018, we deployed 196 satellite tags on loggerheads within the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf region, a seasonal foraging area. Tag location data combined with depth and remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) were used to characterize the species’ current thermal range in the MAB. The best-fitting model indicated that the habitat envelope for tagged loggerheads consisted of SST ranging from 11.0° to 29.7 °C and depths between 0 and 105.0 m. The calculated core bathythermal range consisted of SSTs between 15.0° and 28.0 °C and depths between 8.0 and 92.0 m, with the highest probability of presence occurred in regions with SST between 17.7° and 25.3 °C and at depths between 26.1 and 74.2 m. This model was then forced by a high-resolution global climate model under a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to project loggerhead probability of presence over the next 80 years. Our results suggest that loggerhead thermal habitat and seasonal duration will likely increase in northern regions of the NW Atlantic shelf. This change in spatiotemporal range for sea turtles in a region of high anthropogenic use may prompt adjustments to the localized protected species conservation measures.","Patel, S.H.; Winton, M.V.; Hatch, J.M.; Haas, H.L.; Saba, V.S.; Fay, G.; Smolowitz, R.J.",WOS:000644947800003,"Patel, Samir, S.H.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-021-88290-9,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We have extended DIVAnd to include additional dynamic constraints relevant to surface currents, including imposing a zero normal velocity at the coastline, imposing a low horizontal divergence of the surface currents, temporal coherence and simplified dynamics based on the Coriolis force, and the possibility of including a surface pressure gradient. The impact of these constraints is evaluated by cross-validation using the HF (high-frequency) radar surface current observations in the Ibiza Channel from the Balearic Islands Coastal Ocean Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB). A small fraction of the radial current observations are set aside to validate the velocity reconstruction. The remaining radial currents from the two radar sites are combined to derive total surface currents using DIVAnd and then compared to the cross-validation dataset and to drifter observations. The benefit of the dynamic constraints is shown relative to a variational interpolation without these dynamical constraints. The best results were obtained using the Coriolis force and the surface pressure gradient as a constraint which are able to improve the reconstruction from the Open-boundary Modal Analysis, a quite commonly used method to interpolate HF radar observations, once multiple time instances are considered together.","Barth, A.; Troupin, C.; Reyes, E.; Alvera-Azcárate, A.; Beckers, J.-M.; Tintoré, J.",WOS:000610463900001,"Tintoré, Joaquín, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10236-020-01432-x,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,HF radar; Surface currents; Dynamic constraints; Data-interpolating variational analysis; Ibiza Channel,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Then, we constructed a haploweb to visualize possible species boundaries using the criterion of mutual allelic exclusivity. With this method, we confirm that the previously described phenotypic variants belong to a single species that apparently extends from Indonesia to Madagascar.

However, individual niche differences may also temporally vary as a result of behavioural plasticity. While it is well understood how niche variation is affected by changes in resource availability, comparatively little is known about the extent to which individual niche differences may vary within the annual cycle due to internal drivers. Here, we assess how time- and energy-constraints imposed by incubating and brood rearing affect inter- and intra-individual variation in the foraging behaviour of lesser black-backed gulls, a generalist seabird with strong individual niche variation. To this end, we compared daily foraging trips of 22 breeding and 23 non-breeding GPS-tracked adult gulls from two colonies in the Southern Bight of the North Sea over the course of the breeding season. We find that breeding birds, unlike non-breeding ones, did indeed alter their foraging behaviour during the breeding season. Both sexes reduced their searching effort by increasingly revisiting earlier foraging locations, allowing for shorter and more frequent foraging trips. Breeding females also showed pronounced shifts in their habitat use and strongly specialised on urbanised foraging habitats throughout the breeding season. Hence, while individual variation in habitat use remained largely consistent within non-breeders and in breeding males, individual variation among breeding females almost completely disappeared. Female lesser black-backed gulls are on average smaller, and therefore often outcompeted by males for the most profitable food sources. The temporal specialisation on spatially reliable anthropogenic food sources during breeding hence suggests a complex interplay between intrinsic competitive constraints, resource reliability and shifting time- and energy budges in shaping temporal dynamics in individual niche variation within our study population.","Baert, J.M.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Verbruggen, F.; Van de Weghe, N.; Lens, L.; Müller, W.",WOS:000649376700001,"Baert, Jan, J.M.","Dept of Biology, Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology Group, Univ. of Antwerp",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/oik.08067,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"learning, lesser black-backed gull, niche, optimal foraging, specialisation",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Diffuse flow habitats within ABE are dominated by three foundation species: (1) the snail Alviniconcha hessleri, exposed to average vent fluid temperatures of ~24 °C, (2) the snail Ifremeria nautilei at ~12 °C, and (3) the mussel Bathymodiolus septemdierum in average temperatures of ~6 °C. In each habitat, three samples were taken using a quantitative collection device (mussel-pot). Copepod abundance ranged from 1 to 30 ind. per 10 cm2, with no significant differences between the three habitats. A total of 18 copepod species were identified. In the Alviniconcha habitat, the vent endemic dirivultid copepod Stygiopontius lauensis dominated the community, representing >90% of the individuals. Species richness and Shannon diversity were significantly higher in the Bathymodiolus habitat, correlated with lower temperatures, lower hydrogen sulfide concentrations and higher oxygen concentrations. This increase in diversity was driven by a community mostly comprised of habitat generalists including genera reported from shallow coastal waters, shallow vents, and peripheral vent environments.

In this study, we explored the species-level taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships, and geographic distributions of the tritoniid nudibranchs. During numerous expeditions, specimens from southern South America, Sub-Antarctic Islands, and Antarctica were collected, documented alive, and fixed for anatomical descriptions and genetic sequencing. DNA from 167 specimens were extracted and sequenced for mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (H3) markers. An additional 109 sequences of all available tritoniids plus additional outgroups were downloaded from GenBank for comparative purposes. Maximum Likelihood under the GHOST model of evolution and Bayesian inference using the GTR+GAMMA model produced congruent topologies from concatenated alignments. The results of ABGD, GMYC, bPTP, and mPTP species delimitation analyses suggest many separately evolving units that do not coincide with traditionally recognized species limits. Southern Ocean Tritoniella and Tritonia species split into several previously unrecognized species. This result is in accordance with the limited dispersal abilities of some southern tritoniids.

We find the average C:N:P of dinoflagellates is 90:12:1; higher in C:N, and lower in C:P and N:P than the canonical Redfield ratio. In aggregate the three traits examined here account for between 20–31% while taxonomic order accounts for between 37–38% of the variance in C:N:P.

This is the first of its kind high frequency observation over the tidal cycle ranging from highest high tide to lowest low tide in this estuary revealing dynamic variability of zooplankton assemblages. Zooplankton abundance was higher during high tide in comparison to low tide, irrespective of salinity regimes. On the diurnal scale, it was higher at night in comparison to the day at both E1 and E2. The higher abundance of zooplankton groups such as Copepoda, Cladocera, and planktonic larvae during the night at E1 as well as E2 indicating an upward migration. Many of the zooplankton taxa (e.g., <i>Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus</i>, <i>Pseudodiaptomus</i> sp., <i>Acartia danae</i>, <i>Acrocalanus longicornis</i>, <i>Oithona</i> sp., <i>Corycaeus andrewsi</i>) migrated towards E1 due to tidal effect during high tide and maintained their position even during low tide.

The tidal variability of Brachyura (zoea and megalopa) revealed different emergence times that indicated dispersal of zoeas to the adjacent Bay of Bengal and the return of magalopa to the Mahanadi Estuary. Species diversity index was higher during high tide, and prominent at E2. At E1, marine, fresh, marine-brackish, and marine-brackish-fresh zooplankton species dominated during high tide, while brackish-fresh taxa dominated during low tide. Differently, E2 was enriched with marine, marine-brackish, and marine-brackish-fresh taxa during high tide, whereas fresh, brackish-fresh, and marine-fresh dominated during low tide.

We measure the frequency and duration of EHE and ECE by season across years and estimate how these measures have changed over time. Frequency and duration for both EHE and ECE presented similar patterns characterized by low spatial heterogeneity and strong seasonal variation. High EHE frequency and duration occurred within the Antarctic during the austral summer and winter and within the Arctic Ocean during the boreal winter. High ECE frequency and duration occurred within the Nearctic and Palearctic during the boreal winter and the Arctic Ocean during the boreal summer. The trend analysis presented pronounced differences between frequency and duration, high spatial heterogeneity, especially within terrestrial environments, and strong seasonal variation. Positive EHE trends, primarily in duration within marine environments, occurred during the boreal summer within the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and during the austral summer within the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The eastern tropical Pacific contained positive EHE and ECE trends, primary in duration during the boreal winter.

The washwater is more acidic than the surrounding seawater and contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter, nitrates, nitrites, and heavy metals including nickel, lead, copper, and mercury. Scrubber washwater is toxic to some marine organisms, harms others, and can worsen water quality.    This report is the first global assessment of the mass of washwater discharges expected from ships using scrubbers. The authors used 2019 ship traffic, as a pre-COVID-19 baseline, and considered approximately 3,600 ships that had scrubbers installed by the end of 2020. Results show that absent additional regulations, ships with scrubbers will emit at least 10 gigatonnes (Gt) of scrubber washwater each year. For context, the entire shipping sector carries about 11 Gt of cargo each year.

We conducted the evaluation under two scenarios: 1) Scenario 1 considers designated PAs; and 2) Scenario 2, that also includes potential OECMs. In order to generate Scenario 2, thirteen legal categories were assessed against international guidance on OECMs as a first step to screen their likelihood of providing OECMs in Spain. Our findings show that some potentially satisfactory OECM categories such as Public Utility Forests, River Reserves or Geoparks meet the OECM criteria to a large degree and deserve further study. Our results also highlight that Spain is currently well above most foreseeable post-2020 biodiversity targets and even close to some ecological targets using just PAs, except for marine protected area (MPA) management and MPA offshore coverage. Adding OECMs would noticeably improve the country’s figures yet without reaching many exigent ecological targets. OECMs can become a useful, cost-effective biodiversity conservation tool that contributes to international targets under new, more ambitious area-based conservation requirements in Spain and elsewhere.

The extent to which dynamic (within-season) changes in anthropogenic landscapes affect these interactions is poorly understood. Lesser Black-backed Gulls <i>Larus fuscus</i> are prominent bio-vectors of biological, synthetic and inorganic materials and have exhibited large increases in abundance in parts of southern Europe in recent decades. We combined GPS tracking, earth observation, accelerometry and field observations to study the space use of overwintering gulls in a mixed rice field landscape in Andalusia, southern Spain. We used Manly selectivity metrics, a common quantitative measurement of habitat selection, and classified remote sensing imagery directly to evaluate space use and habitat selection for these gulls and how it changed throughout the rice harvest cycle. Analysis of over 45 000 GPS fixes and 14 classified remotely sensed images from winter 2016/17 showed dynamic space use driven by the harvest-related flooding across the rice harvest cycle. Prior to harvest, gulls foraged in rice paddies during the day and roosted in adjacent waterbodies (the River Guadalquivir and fish ponds) at night. During harvest, they spent nearly 100% of their daily cycle within the rice fields, foraging in harvested paddies and roosting in post-harvest, flooded paddies. After harvest, they roosted in flooded paddies at night and foraged at landfills in the surrounding landscape. Gull space use at landscape and paddy scales was closely linked to dynamic land and water management over the rice agricultural cycle, illustrating how human activities influence the movements of ecologically important, human-associated bio-vectors such as gulls. The frequent early-spring movement patterns of gulls between landfills and agricultural fields makes them an important bio-transport link for potentially toxic materials and pathogens between waste sites and places where food is grown for human consumption.","van Rees, C.B.; Aragonés, D.; Bouten, W.; Thaxter, C.B.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Bustamante, J.; Green, A.J.",NULL,"Bustamante, Javier, J.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12968,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,Remote sensing,NULL,"accelerometer, GPS-tracking, landfill, migration, waterbird",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Deep-seabed mining targets these mineral-rich nodules and will likely modify the consumer-resource (trophic) and substrate-providing (non-trophic) interactions within the abyssal food web. However, the importance of nodules and their associated sessile fauna in supporting food-web integrity remains unclear. Here, we use seafloor imagery and published literature to develop highly-resolved trophic and non-trophic interaction webs for the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ, central Pacific Ocean) and the Peru Basin (PB, South-East Pacific Ocean) and to assess how nodule removal may modify these networks. The CCZ interaction web included 1028 compartments connected with 59,793 links and the PB interaction web consisted of 342 compartments and 8044 links. We show that knock-down effects of nodule removal resulted in a 17.9% (CCZ) to 20.8% (PB) loss of all taxa and 22.8% (PB) to 30.6% (CCZ) loss of network links. Subsequent analysis identified stalked glass sponges living attached to the nodules as key structural species that supported a high diversity of associated fauna. We conclude that polymetallic nodules are critical for food-web integrity and that their absence will likely result in reduced local benthic biodiversity.","Stratmann, T.; Soetaert, K.; Kersken, D.; van Oevelen, D.",NULL,"Kersken, Daniel, D.",NULL,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91703-4,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Biodiversity; Ecological modelling; Ecology; Marine biology; Ocean sciences,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Contemporary ocean biomes have been constructed based on various approaches. These included the biogeographic patterns of higher trophic level organisms, physical and biogeochemical properties, or bulk biological properties such as chlorophyll-a, but none considered the biogeographic patterns of the first trophic level explicitly, i.e. phytoplankton biogeography. A global description of marine biomes based on phytoplankton and defined in analogy to terrestrial vegetation biomes is still lacking. A bioregionalization based on phytoplankton appears particularly timely, as phytoplankton have a high sensitivity to climatic changes and fuel marine productivity. Here, we partition the global ocean into biomes by using self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering, drawing on the biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species predicted from empirical evidence. Our approach reveals eight different biomes at the seasonal scale, and seven at the annual scale. The biomes host characteristic phytoplankton species compositions, and differ in their prevailing environmental conditions. The largest differences in phytoplankton composition are found between a Pacific equatorial biome and other tropical biomes, and between subtropical and high latitude biomes. The Pacific equatorial biome is characterized by species with narrower ecological niches, the tropical and subtropical biomes by cosmopolitan generalists, and the high latitudes by species with a heterogeneous biogeography. The strongest differences between biomes are found along gradients of temperature and macronutrient availability, associated with latitude. We test whether our biomes can be reproduced based on indicator species, or potential co-occurrence networks of species determined from the predicted species distributions that are wide-spread in some but rare in other biomes. We find that our biomes can be reproduced by the 51 species identified, which together form significant species co-occurrences. This suggests that species co-occurrences, rather than individual indicator species drive oceanic biome partitioning at the first trophic level. Our biome partitioning may be especially useful for comparative analyses on the functional implications of phytoplankton organization, and impacts on zoogeographical partitionings. Furthermore, it provides a framework for predicting large-scale changes in phytoplankton community structure due to anthropogenic climate and environmental change.","Hofmann Elizondo, U.; Righetti, D.; Benedetti, F.; Vogt, M.",NULL,"Benedetti, Fabio, F.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102530,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Biomes; Phytoplankton; Self-organizing map; Indicator species; Species network; Species distribution models,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We confirm recent studies that show a slight dip in species richness at the equator. Moreover, richness across latitudinal bands was sensitive to temperature, reaching a plateau or declining above a mean annual sea surface temperature of 20 °C for most taxa. In response, since the 1970s, species richness has declined at the equator relative to an increase at midlatitudes and has shifted north in the northern hemisphere, particularly among pelagic species. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that climate change is impacting the latitudinal gradient in marine biodiversity at a global scale. The intensification of the dip in species richness at the equator, especially for pelagic species, suggests that it is already too warm there for some species to survive.","Chaudhary, C.; Richardson, A.J.; Schoeman, D.S.; Costello, M.J.",NULL,"Chaudhary, Chhaya, C.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015094118,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,species richness; latitudinal gradient; climate change; OBIS; GAM,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, seafloor habitats and their communities exhibit high spatial variability and heterogeneity that challenges the way in which we assess the state of the Southern Ocean benthos on larger scales. The Antarctic shelf is rich in diversity compared with deeper water areas, important for storing carbon (“blue carbon”) and provides habitat for commercial fish species. In this paper, we focus on the seafloor habitats of the Antarctic shelf, which are vulnerable to drivers of change including increasing ocean temperatures, iceberg scour, sea ice melt, ocean acidification, fishing pressures, pollution and non-indigenous species. Some of the most vulnerable areas include the West Antarctic Peninsula, which is experiencing rapid regional warming and increased iceberg-scouring, subantarctic islands and tourist destinations where human activities and environmental conditions increase the potential for the establishment of non-indigenous species and active fishing areas around South Georgia, Heard and MacDonald Islands. Vulnerable species include those in areas of regional warming with low thermal tolerance, calcifying species susceptible to increasing ocean acidity as well as slow-growing habitat-forming species that can be damaged by fishing gears e.g., sponges, bryozoan, and coral species. Management regimes can protect seafloor habitats and key species from fishing activities; some areas will need more protection than others, accounting for specific traits that make species vulnerable, slow growing and long-lived species, restricted locations with optimum physiological conditions and available food, and restricted distributions of rare species. Ecosystem-based management practices and long-term, highly protected areas may be the most effective tools in the preservation of vulnerable seafloor habitats. Here, we focus on outlining seafloor responses to drivers of change observed to date and projections for the future. We discuss the need for action to preserve seafloor habitats under climate change, fishing pressures and other anthropogenic impacts.","Brasier, M.J.; Barnes, D.; Bax, N.; Brandt, A.; Christianson, A.B.; Constable, A.J.; Downey, R.; Figuerola, B.; Griffiths, H.; Gutt, J.; Lockhart, S.; Morley, S.A.; Post, A.L.; Van de Putte, A.; Saeedi, H.; Stark, J.S.; Sumner, M.; Waller, C.L.",WOS:000656249900001,"Christianson, Anne, A.B.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.622721,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Do non-native sea anemones (Cnidaria: Actiniaria) share a common invasion pattern? – A systematic review. <i>Aquat. Invasions 16(3)</i>: 365-390","A number of cnidarian species are known to have become marine invaders across a diversity of regions and habitats, including sea anemones of the order Actiniaria. Unfortunately, integrative approaches to identify and describe general patterns and likely drivers of their invasion process have only been of recent interest. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize and categorize the literature published on non-native populations of sea anemone species and to assess whether these records exhibit a shared common invasion pattern. A total of 126 articles were analyzed, in which 11 species presented records of suspected non-native populations. Our results showed that sea anemone invasions date back to at least the late 1890s and new introductions have recently been reported for different species in the last five years. Some potential biases in the literature were found in relation to species, marine realms and study approaches. Most study efforts have been focused on a single species (<i>Diadumene lineata</i>), especially in the Temperate Northern Atlantic. A seemingly common shared pattern was found and described throughout all stages of the invasion continuum, but more effort should be focused on the less reported/studied species. Transport has mainly been mediated by human-associated vectors, such as maritime traffic and aquaculture. Newly arrived individuals colonize mostly natural habitats, although some species thrive in human-made habitats. A diverse array of traits has been associated with the invasion success of sea anemones, although the two most frequently reported traits in the literature were abiotic tolerance and the reproductive strategies. Unlike other benthic invaders, the dispersal mechanisms (both primary and secondary spread) and the ecological or economic consequences produced by nonnative sea anemone populations have been little explored and thus need more attention. We discuss potential ways to reduce some of the gaps and research biases found and thus develop a better understanding of the invasion ecology of sea anemones.","Gimenez, L.H.; Brante, A.",NULL,"Brante, Antonio, A.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Anemonia, ""Diadumene"", ""Exaiptasia"", ""Metridium"", ""Nematostella"", ""Sagartia""",NULL,NULL,"Anemonia, Diadumene, ecological effects, Exaiptasia, invasion ecology, marine realm, Metridium, Nematostella, Sagartia",Journal article,NULL,NULL

To address this knowledge gap, we provide a holistic trophic characterization of a jelly web in the eastern tropical Atlantic, based on δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N stable isotope analysis of a unique gelatinous zooplankton sample set. The jelly web covered most of the isotopic niche space of the entire planktonic oceanic food web, spanning > 3 trophic levels, ranging from herbivores (e.g., pyrosomes) to higher predators (e.g., ctenophores), highlighting the diverse functional roles and broad possible food web relevance of gelatinous zooplankton. Among gelatinous zooplankton taxa, comparisons of isotopic niches pointed to the presence of differentiation and resource partitioning, but also highlighted the potential for competition, e.g., between hydromedusae and siphonophores. Significant differences in spatial (seamount vs. open ocean) and depth-resolved patterns (0–400 m vs. 400–1000 m) pointed to additional complexity, and raise questions about the extent of connectivity between locations and differential patterns in vertical coupling between gelatinous zooplankton groups. Added complexity also resulted from inconsistent patterns in trophic ontogenetic shifts among groups. We conclude that the broad trophic niche covered by the jelly web, patterns in niche differentiation within this web, and substantial complexity at the spatial, depth, and taxon level call for a more careful consideration of gelatinous zooplankton in oceanic food web models. In light of climate change and fishing pressure, the data presented here also provide a valuable baseline against which to measure future trophic observations of gelatinous zooplankton communities in the eastern tropical Atlantic.","Chi, X.; Dierking, J.; Hoving, H.-J.; Lüskow, F.; Denda, A.; Christiansen, B.; Sommer, U.; Hansen, T.; Javidpour, J.",NULL,"Sommer, Ulrich, U.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11605,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Digitization errors were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the variation among individuals. In <i>Tubuca seismella</i> and <i>Tubuca signata</i> (superfamily Ocypodoidea), species that have traditionally been studied for sexual dimorphism, standardized major claw sizes were 2.8 and 3.7, respectively, times larger for males than females. Sexual dimorphism in claw size was also observed for <i>Metopograpsus frontalis</i> and <i>Parasesarma longicristatum</i> (superfamily Grapsoidea), with the largest claw in males being 15% and 33%, respectively, larger than in females. In contrast to size, claw shape did not relate to sex, except for <i>T</i>. <i>seismella.</i> Carapace shape, although variable among individuals and displaying asymmetry, was unrelated to sex. Claw and carapace shapes displayed high correlations, with values around 0.78. Carapace shapes grouped into taxonomic families and linked to habitat preferences, while claw shapes varied along a taxonomic gradient.

Additionally, NPF events were observed during the nighttime and during episodes of high desert-dust loadings. Particle formation rates and growth rates were comparable to those in urban environments, although our site is a rural one. Meteorological variables and trace gases played a role in explaining the intra-monthly variability of NPF events, but they did not explain why summer months had the least NPF frequency. Similarly, pre-existing aerosol loading did not explain the observed seasonality. The months with the least NPF frequency were associated with higher H<span class=""inline-formula""><sub>2</sub></span>SO<span class=""inline-formula""><sub>4</sub></span> concentrations but lower NO<span class=""inline-formula""><sub>2</sub></span> concentrations, which is an indicator of anthropogenic influence. Air masses arriving from the Middle East were not observed during these months, which could suggest that precursor vapors important for nucleation and growth are transported to our site from the Middle East. Further comprehensive measurements of precursor vapors are required to prove this hypothesis.","Baalbaki, R.; Pikridas, M.; Jokinen, T.; Laurila, T.; Dada, L.; Bezantakos, S.; Ahonen, L.; Neitola, K.; Maisser, A.; Bimenyimana, E.; Christodoulou, A.; Unga, F.; Savvides, C.; Lehtipalo, K.; Kangasluoma, J.; Biskos, G.; Petäjä, T.; Kerminen, V.-M.; Sciare, J.; Kulmala, M.",NULL,"Baalbaki, Rima, R.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9223-2021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The production of bioactive molecules (known as conopeptides or conotoxins) marks the <i>Conus</i> as an utmost promising animal source for medicinal applications. This reflects the need for quick and reliable proof of the studied species’ identity. However, identification based on morphological characters has limitations and necessitates complementation with molecular techniques. DNA barcoding based on the  mitochondrial <i>cytochrome oxidase</i> subunit I (COI) is currently used as a quick and reliable tool for species identification throughout the globe. The primary objective of this study is to establish reference sequences for <i>Conus</i> species from the Egyptian Red Sea coast, and to evaluate the capacity of DNA barcodes for specimen’ identification. The results of the present study revealed that COI sequences were matched for their maximum identity with those available in the GenBank and BOLD engine and gave matches to <i>Conus</i> species for all studied species (100% match rate). In all cases, DNA analyses were consistent with species classification based on shell characters. According to the phylogenetic tree, all <i>Conus</i> species were recovered as monophyletic and the seven studied species of <i>Conus</i> were well nested in seven separate clades/subclades with closely related species. In conclusion, our study successfully confirms the efficiency of DNA barcoding for specimen identification of different cone snails.

In agreement with the Paris Accords, most of the AGC have published short-term goals to reduce their carbon emissions in the coming decades. In relation to these goals, this study explores the potential CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, avoidance and removal in the region, by comparing a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario to three decarbonization scenarios for the power sector. In 2018, the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the AGC were ~1333 MtCO<sub>2</sub>/yr and are expected to rise to 1568 MtCO<sub>2</sub>/yr in 2030 following a BAU scenario, which is likely to be reduced to 1522 MtCO<sub>2</sub>/yr in 2030 by following the countries’ planning. Countries issued plans for the coming decades that focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in their grid mix. The three decarbonization scenarios presented in this study focus on supply-side technological solutions. The retirement of the oldest natural-gas and oil power plants could lead to a total emissions reduction of ~75 MtCO<sub>2</sub>/yr, without accounting for the embodied carbon emissions associated with renewable energy. In addition, the implementation of point-source capture at power plants expected to retire in >10 years’ time could avoid emissions of ~240 MtCO<sub>2</sub>/yr, provided the CO<sub>2</sub> is permanently sequestered in appropriate geological formations. The region also shows high-quality solar resources and large CO<sub>2</sub>-storage potential that could couple to direct air-capture plants to offset difficult-to-avoid emissions. This last scenario has the potential to ultimately result in net negative emissions.","Alatiq, A.; Aljedani, W.; Abussaud, A.; Algarni, O.; Pilorgé, H.; Wilcox, J.",NULL,"Alatiq, Abdulrahman, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ce/zkab015,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

At that time, the area of ZPF was approximately 11000 km<sup>2</sup>. More than a century after the description of ZPF, long-term changes in its phyto- and zoobenthos have been noted. A period of ecological crisis of the Black Sea ecosystem during the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was destructive for the phytobenthos of ZPF, with the complete degradation of unattached <em>Phyllophora</em> biocoenosis. In contrast, after a sharp decline in the quantitative development of macrozoobenthos of the soft bottoms in the 1970s, its recovery to pre-crisis levels in the 2010s was noted. Despite the difference in the aforementioned phyto- and zoobenthos dynamics, habitat in the 4025 km² area of the botanical sanctuary of national importance “Zernov’s <em>Phyllophora</em> Field” was recognised as Critically Endangered (CR) within the European Red List of Habitats. In this context, the goal of the present study is to clarify the applicability of the CR category to the entire benthic complex of ZPF water area and to assess the current biocoenotic structure and habitat ordination of the zoobenthos on soft bottoms of the ZPF water area in the current conditions of Black Sea de-eutrophication. The obtained results indicate the presence of one biocoenotic complex (<em>Mytilus galloprovincialis</em>) and three subcomplexes in the zoobenthos of ZPF, where the bivalves <em>Mytilaster lineatus</em>, <em>Modiolula phaseolina</em>, as well as Polychaeta are the next most important subcomplex-forming taxa. Throughout all studies of ZPF, relative stability in the biocoenotic representation of the bottom fauna—with the dominance of <em>M. galloprovincialis</em>—has been observed. Due to the current levels of development in both the soft-bottom macrofauna and assemblages of unattached alga <em>Phyllophora</em>, two different habitats were proposed for identification in the water area of the botanical sanctuary. The first habitat – “Aggregations of unattached red algae <em>Phyllophora </em>in the central part of the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea"" – was degraded and can be classified as a CR habitat. The second one – “Pontic circalittoral biogenic detritic bottoms with dead or alive mussel beds, shell deposits, with encrusting corallines and attached foliose sciaphilic macroalgae” – represents the soft-bottom biotope and was associated with the biocoenotic complex <em>M. galloprovincialis, </em>proposed for classification as Least Concern. In accordance with three biocoenotic subcomplexes of complex <em>M. galloprovincialis</em>, the spatial position of the three subhabitats was determined on the soft-bottom in the water area of ZPF.","Revkov, N.K.; Boltachova, N.",NULL,"Revkov, Nikolai K., N.K.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.37828/em.2021.39.11,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Mytilus galloprovincialis,NULL,NULL,"biocoenosis, biocoenotic complex, bottom habitat, EUNIS habitat classification, Mytilus galloprovincialis",Journal article,NULL,NULL

One hundred and twenty genes were identified as significantly up-regulated in Antarctic species and surprisingly shared by red- and white-blooded notothenioids, unveiling several previously unreported molecular players that might have contributed to the evolutionary success of Cryonotothenioidea in Antarctica. In particular, we detected cobalamin deficiency signatures and discussed the possible biological implications of this condition concerning hematological alterations and the heavy parasitic loads typically observed in all Cryonotothenioidea.","Ansaloni, F.; Gerdol, M.; Torboli, V.; Fornaini, N.R.; Greco, S.; Giulianini, P.G.; Coscia, M.R.; Miccoli, A.; Santovito, G.; Buonocore, F.; Scapigliati, G.; Pallavicini, A.",NULL,"Scapigliati, Giuseppe, G.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22041812,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Chionodraco hamatus, ""Eleginops maclovinus""",NULL,NULL,Cryonotothenioidea; cold adaptation; transcobalamin; Antarctica; RNA-seq,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially powerful technique to study oceanic cephalopod biodiversity and distribution but has not been applied thus far. We present a novel universal primer pair for metabarcoding cephalopods from eDNA, <i>Ceph18S</i> (Forward: 5′-CGC GGC GCT ACA TAT TAG AC-3′, Reverse: 5′-GCA CTT AAC CGA CCG TCG AC-3′). The primer pair targets the hypervariable region V2 of the nuclear 18S rRNA gene and amplifies a relatively short target sequence of approximately 200 bp in order to allow the amplification of degraded DNA. <i>In silico</i> tests on a reference database and empirical tests on DNA extracts from cephalopod tissue estimate that 44–66% of cephalopod species, corresponding to about 310–460 species, can be amplified and identified with this primer pair. A multi-marker approach with the novel <i>Ceph18S</i> and two previously published cephalopod mitochondrial 16S rRNA primer sets targeting the same region (Jarman <i>et al</i>. 2006 <i>Mol. Ecol.

The results of this phenomenon may have severe consequences, from problems with food production, through mass migration of people, to the threat to unique ecological areas. Hence, the main aim of this research was to investigate the impact of sea level rise on the land cover structure in the region and how it may affect the situation of the countries in the region. For this purpose, GlobCover 2009 data and projections of sea level rise by one meter were used and a multiband raster image was created containing information about the land cover class, country and whether the area is threatened by sea level rise. All calculations have been made on the raster prepared in this way, which shows that 4.4% of South East Asia's areas are at risk of rising sea levels. Finally, the ratio was calculated for each land cover class. This showed the unusual vulnerability of some of the classes to rising sea levels like irrigated croplands and urban areas.","Michalak, P.; Patsili, A.; Carmen, O.; Keßler, C.",NULL,"Michalak, Piotr, P.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-2-36-2021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"sea level rise, land structure, Southeast Asia",Journal article,Conference paper,NULL

Ascidians are one of the most common Antarctic epibenthic megafauna, but information on their distribution and the determinants is still scarce. In this study we investigated spatial patterns of ascidians in Marian Cove (MC), a rapidly deglaciating fjord in the West Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth. We also analyzed key drivers structuring the communities and assessed their relevance to glacial retreat and following processes. The first applied ROV survey in MC discovered that ascidians were the most diverse (14 out of 64 taxa) taxa with the greatest abundance (~264 inds·m<sup>−2</sup>). Ascidian abundance and diversity greatly varied in space, by distance from glacier and/or depths, explaining ~64% of total megafaunal variations. Notably, in deep seabed (50–90 m) they shifted distinctly from early colonization communities near glacier (0.2 km to glacier) with predominance of two opportunistic species, <em>Molgula pedunculata</em> and <em>Cnemidocarpa verrucosa</em>, to mature communities at the most remote site (3.5 km). A set of analyses revealed that such shifts were related mostly to changes in sediment properties that develop in association with glacial retreat and consequent processes. Sediment composition, grain size and sorting collectively explained outward increasing physical stability apparently with decreased influence of glacial retreat, supporting ascidian community maturing at the deep and distant site. BIOENV analysis indicated that “distance” to glacier is one key factor influencing ascidian community structure in the deep seabed. Overall, the results of the analyses strongly indicated that physical disturbances (mainly sedimentation and ice scouring) accompanying glacial retreat are an important force shaping ascidian assemblages in the cove, and that these forces are altered by the distance from the glacier and water depth. Notably, in this fjord, the period of sea bed deglaciation was roughly proportional to the distance to glacier over the last six decades. This suggested that the ascidian shift identified in this study reflects a long-term successional process associated with glacial retreat in the past in MC, which in turn warrants to project future changes in this glacial fjord and possibly other similar environments.","Kim, D.-U.; Khim, J.S.; Ahn, I.-Y.",NULL,"Kim, Dong-U, D.-U.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107467,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Marian Cove, Antarctic fjord, Glacial retreat, Ascidian distribution and succession, Distance to glacier, Ice scouring, Sedimentation",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Considering the specific requirements, related to ecological restoration, such as the absence of pathogens and the preservation of high genetic diversity, the current supply is insufficient. Despite the development of breeding and controlled reproduction techniques for this species since the late 1930s, seed production today is mainly based on empirical concepts. Several of the issues that producers still face are already subjects of research; many others are still unanswered or even unaddressed. This review provides a summary of all available knowledge and technologies of <i>O. edulis</i> seed production. Furthermore, it provides a detailed reflection on implications for restoration, future challenges, open questions and it identifies relevant research topics for sustainable seed supply.

Our results also reveal deep-time climate legacies in ectotherms, whereby orders that originated in cold paleoclimates have presently lower cold tolerance limits than those with warm thermal ancestry. Conversely, heat tolerance appears unrelated to climate ancestry. Cold tolerance has evolved more quickly than heat tolerance in endotherms and ectotherms.

In this study, we shed light on the long-term discussed systematics and taxonomy of Antarctic <i>Tritonia</i> species using morpho-anatomical and molecular techniques. Samples from the Weddell Sea and Bouvet Island were dissected and prepared for scanning electron microscopy. The three molecular markers COI, 16S, and H3 were sequenced and analysed through maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. The phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation tests clearly distinguished two species, <i>T. challengeriana</i> widely spread in the Southern Ocean and <i>T. dantarti</i> endemic to Bouvet Island<i>.</i> Colouration seems to be an unreliable character to differentiate among species since molecular data revealed both species can either have orange or white colour morphotypes. This variability could be explained by pigment sequestration from the soft coral species they feed on. Morphological analyses reveal differences between Antarctic and Magellanic specimens of <i>T. challengeriana.</i> However, the relationship between <i>T. challengeriana</i> specimens from these two regions remains still unclear due to the lack of molecular data. Therefore, the validity of the <i>T. antarctica</i> Martens & Pfeffer, 1886, exclusively found in Antarctic waters requires further systematic work.","Rossi, M.E.; Avila, C.; Moles, J.",NULL,"Rossi, Maria Eleonora, M.E.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02813-8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Tritonia, ""Tritoniidae""",NULL,NULL,"Phylogenetic analyses, Southern Ocean, Species delimitation tests, Tritoniidae taxonomy",Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, we examined the potential impacts of habitat changes by comparing species commonality and community structure (i.e., species richness, abundance, and functional composition) among artificial (a breakwater wall) and natural habitats (eelgrass bed, intertidal flat, and subtidal bottom) within a semi-enclosed coastal sea impacted by marine urbanization. We found considerable species overlap (i.e., high species sharing) among the eelgrass bed, intertidal flat, and subtidal bottom habitats. By contrast, the breakwater wall was a distinctive habitat with little overlap in species and functional groups with the other habitats, and was therefore a poor substitute for natural habitats.

The study aimed to provide a long-term and large-scale Serie (168 years) concerning cyclonic activity and characterization of extreme cyclones in the North Atlantic Basin, considering as a reference the World Meteorological definition Organization. The trend of extreme events in the 1851-2019 period was calculated from the records of the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship and the statistical method ""Exceeding a relative threshold,"" from the variables: ""maximum speed of sustained winds"" and ""minimum atmospheric pressure.""

As a possible sediment remediation method in situ, thin-layer capping with powdered activated carbon (AC) mixed with clay was applied at two test sites at 30 m and 95 m depth in the Grenland fjords. This study presents long-term effects of the AC treatment on the benthic community structure, i.e. nine years after capping. Capping with AC significantly reduced the number of species, their abundance and biomass at the two test sites, compared to uncapped reference sites. At the more shallow site, the dominant brittle star species <i>Amphiura filiformis</i> disappeared shortly after capping and did not re-establish nine years after capping. At the deeper site, the AC treatment also caused long-lasting negative effects on the benthic community, but some recovery was observed after nine years. Ecological indices used to assess environmental status did not capture the impaired benthic communities caused by the capping. The present study is the first documentation of negative effects of powdered AC on marine benthic communities on a decadal scale. Our results show that the benefits of reduced contaminant bioavailability from capping with AC should be carefully weighed against the cost of long-term detrimental effects on the benthic community.

Comparison of surveys conducted in June 2012 (before the trawl ban) and June 2015 (2.5 years after the ban) revealed higher organic contents in sediment and lower suspended-solid loads in water column, as well as a significant increase in site-based abundance, species richness, functional diversity and among-site similarity of macrobenthos after the trawl ban.

Further, it is traditionally considered the main biogeographic boundary between the Western and Eastern basins of the Mediterranean. Due to the poor knowledge on the benthos composition and distribution in this area, we created the first inventory of megazoobenthos recorded on the trawlable soft bottoms of the North-Western SoS. Samples were collected by bottom trawl surveys between 2003 and 2013 within a depth range of 10–800 m. Overall, 374 taxa with 358 species, belonging to Porifera, Cnidaria, Nemertea, Rotifera, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Sipuncula, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata and Chordata phyla, were found. In addition, the biogeographic affinity of megazoobenthos collected in the SoS to species vulnerable to trawl survey found in other zones of the Central Mediterranean was investigated. Excluding the North Adriatic and the Strait of Messina, moderate affinity values have been recorded within all the biogeographic zones. The benthos species of the North-Western SoS presented the highest affinity with those of the North Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Sea (about 90% of species in common). However, our results show high similarity with species composition of the South-Eastern SoS/South Ionian, North Ionian and Central Adriatic (about 80% of species in common). Our study confirms the role as biogeographic transition zone of the SoS for the Mediterranean biota. Furthermore, the lower affinity with native species of the South-Eastern SoS and the absence of Lessepsian species suggest that the cold waters (due to the permanent up-welling) off the southern coasts of Sicily may act as thermal barrier for regulating species exchange between the Eastern and Western basins. Some concerns about this role of the northern sector of the SoS were discussed in the light of current climate change.","Massi, D.; Titone, A.; Gristina, M.; Garofalo, G.; Lauria, V.; Micalizzi, R.; Sinacori, G.; Fiorentino, F.",NULL,"Titone, Antonino, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.12627,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Boundaries of biodiversity hotspots are often delimited intuitively based on floristic endemism and have seldom been empirically tested using actual species distributions, and especially invertebrates. Here we analyse the zoogeography of terrestrial malacofauna from south-eastern Africa (SEA), proposing the first mollusc-based numerical regionalisation for the area. We also discuss patterns and centres of land snail endemism, thence assessing the importance and the delimitation of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (MPA) biodiversity hotspot for their conservation. An incidence matrix compiled for relatively well-collected lineages of land snails and slugs (73 taxa in twelve genera) in 40 <em>a priori</em> operational geographic units was subjected to (a) phenetic agglomerative hierarchical clustering using unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA), (b) parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and biotic element analysis (BEA). Fulfilling the primary objective of our study, the UPGMA dendrogram provided a hierarchical regionalisation and identified five centres of molluscan endemism for SEA, while the PAE confirmed six areas of endemism, also supported by the BEA. The regionalisation recovers a zoogeographic province similar to the MPA hotspot, but with a conspicuous westward extension into Knysna (towards the Cape). The MPA province, centres and areas of endemism, biotic elements as well as the spatial patterns of species richness and endemism, support the MPA hotspot, but suggest further extensions resulting in a greater MPA region of land snail endemism (also with a northward extension into sky islands—Soutpansberg and Wolkberg), similar to that noted for vertebrates. The greater MPA region provides a more robustly defined region of conservation concern, with centres of endemism serving as local conservation priorities.","Perera, S.J.; Herbert, D.G.; Proches, S.; Ramdhani, S.",NULL,"Perera, Sandun, S.J.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248040,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In Tectipleura, a very diverse group of gastropods with > 27,000 species living in all kinds of habitats, several hemocyanin genes have already been analyzed. Multiple independent duplications of this gene have been identified and may represent potential adaptations to different environments and lifestyles. The aim of this study is to further explore the evolution of these genes by analyzing their exon–intron architectures.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Results</h3><p>We have reconstructed the gene architectures of ten hemocyanin genes from four Tectipleura species: <i>Aplysia californica, Lymnaea stagnalis, Cornu aspersum</i> and <i>Helix pomatia</i>. Their hemocyanin genes each contain 53 introns, significantly more than in the hemocyanin genes of Cephalopoda (9–11), Vetigastropoda (15) and Caenogastropoda (28–33). The gene structures of Tectipleura hemocyanins are identical in terms of intron number and location, with the exception of one out of two hemocyanin genes of <i>L. stagnalis</i> that comprises one additional intron. We found that gene structures that differ between molluscan lineages most probably evolved more recently through independent intron gains.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusions</h3><p>The strict conservation of the large number of introns in Tectipleura hemocyanin genes over 200 million years suggests the influence of a selective pressure on this gene structure. While we could not identify conserved sequence motifs within these introns, it may be simply the great number of introns that offers increased possibilities of gene regulation relative to hemocyanin genes with less introns and thus may have facilitated habitat shifts and speciation events. This hypothesis is supported by the relatively high number of introns within the hemocyanin genes of <i>Pomacea canaliculata</i> that has evolved independently of the Tectipleura. <i>Pomacea canaliculata</i> belongs to the Caenogastropoda, the sister group of Heterobranchia (that encompass Tectipleura) which is also very diverse and comprises species living in different habitats. Our findings provide a hint to some of the molecular mechanisms that may have supported the spectacular radiation of one of Metazoa’s most species rich groups.</p>","Schäfer, G.G.; Pedrini-Martha, V.; Jackson, D.J.; Dallinger, R.; Lieb, B.",NULL,"Dallinger, Reinhard, R.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01763-3,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Hemocyanin, Gene structure, Intron, Intron gain, Evolution, Habitat shift, Adaptation, Tectipleura, Heterobranchia, Mollusca",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Many studies have investigated the potential effects of mining on deep-sea ecosystems and highlighted the importance of defining environmental baseline conditions occurring at potential mining sites. However, current information on biodiversity and species distributions in the CCZ is still scarce and hampers the ability to effectively manage and reduce the potential impacts of mining activities. As part of the regulatory regimes adopted by the International Seabed Authority, concession holders are required to conduct an environmental impact assessment and gather baseline data on biodiversity and community structure in relation to their license areas. In the present study, we used an integrative molecular and morphological approach to assess species richness and genetic variation of deep-sea scavenging amphipods collected in two nodule-mining exploration areas (UK-1 and OMS-1 areas) and one Area of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI-6) in the eastern part of the CCZ. We analyzed the DNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene of 645 specimens belonging to ten distinct morphospecies.

For these invertebrates, Knysna comprises several significantly different compartments: sandy mouth; well-flushed marine embayment; poorly flushed central sea-water 'lagoon'; and two disjunct but faunistically similar peripheral regions–marine backwater channels, and low-salinity upper estuary. Although macrofauna ranges from dilute brackish to fully marine, its abundance, local patchiness, and over considerable stretches, species density remains remarkably constant; further, one-third of species occur throughout. Intertidally, all but peripheral compartments are low density and infaunally dominated, while some peripheral areas, and much of the subtidal, are higher density and epifaunally dominated. Overall, seagrass macrobenthos appears maintained below carrying capacity (e.g., by abundant juvenile fish) and of random species composition within a site. Two further characteristics are notable: Unusually, seagrass supports fewer animals than adjacent unvegetated areas, probably because of lack of bioturbatory disturbance in them, and the vegetation cover may ameliorate ambient habitat conditions. Unfortunately, continual heavy and effectively unpreventable exploitation for bait occurs, and chlorophyte blooms have developed because of high nutrient input. Knysna presents a microcosm of problems facing biodiverse and high-value habitats set within areas of high unemployment where subsistence fishing provides the main source of protein and seagrass provides the only source of bait.","Barnes, R.S.K.",NULL,"Barnes, R.S.K.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09848-3,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Biodiversity, Conservation, Intertidal, Knysna, Macrobenthos, Seagrass",Journal article,NULL,NULL

An attempt was made to study the biofouling communities and succession of macro foulers on the cage culture net installed in the open sea. The main objective of the present study is to reveal the succession pattern of the biofouling communities on the panels of cage culture sites to find out seasonal settlement pattern, Dominant species and Climax community. A long-term study on the succession pattern of the cage farm experimental-net-panels revealed results as Hydroids-Gastropods-Hydroids-Barnacles-<i>Modiolus</i>-Green mussels. Hydroids were initial communities on the net panels and green mussels (<i>Perna viridis</i>) formed the climax community, also dominating on the cage culture nets. Different succession patterns were observed in two sites as well as in culture nets studied. The net panels of the cage were loaded with hydroids in the initial months and the peak fouling was during May. So frequent net cleaning was required during summer and during the spat settlement period of green mussel (September, October and November). <i>Modiolus</i> settlement during February month on the culture nets can be avoided by net exchange immediately after spat fall in this month. This attempt was made to study the ecological succession on the panels, in cages installed in Karwar, which is the first attempt, since the open sea cage culture was initiated in India.  Looking at vast opportunities for further development in biofouling research, the aim of this investigations was  to obtain the baseline information about the ecological succession pattern of biofouling  organisms in fish cage sites. More research on biofouling in mariculture is essential to ensure the profitability of the aquaculture operations with environmental safety measures as a prime criteria.","Mhaddolkar, S.S.; Dineshbabu, A.P.; Loka, J.; Thomus, S.",NULL,"Dineshbabu, A.P.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2021.11.2.l159-171,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"macro fouling communities, succession, climax community, panels, sea cage farm",Journal article,NULL,NULL

The complex prey handling behaviour of large predatory species includes the storage of food in a pouch formed temporarily by bending and contraction of the posterior foot. Such metapodial pouches had been observed only in operculum-lacking Olividae, prompting the hypothesis that the folding of the metapodium into a pouch biomechanically required the absence of operculum. Here we report metapodial pouch formation in an operculate olivid, <i>Callianax biplicata</i> (G. B. Sowerby I, 1825; formerly <i>Olivella biplicata</i>). Since the operculum is too small to close the shell aperture in mature <i>C. biplicata</i>, a protective function seems unlikely. The operculum may rather serve as an exoskeletal point for muscle attachment, but may also represent a ‘vestigial organ’ in the process of evolutionary reduction, or an ontogenetic remnant functional at early life stages but not at maturity. Consequently, our observations refute the notion that only inoperculate olivids can form pouches, but not necessarily the idea that the ability to form a metapodial pouch evolved in parallel with operculum reduction.","Kelly, M.; Schroeder, L.; Mullendore, D.L.; Dattilo, B.F.; Peters, W.S.",NULL,"Kelly, Molly, M.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.12657/folmal.029.001,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Callianax, ""Olividae""",NULL,NULL,"biomechanics, metapodial pouch, Callianax, Olividae, operculum, vestigial organ ",Journal article,NULL,NULL

They mostly date from the Mid-Holocene onwards and are frequently taken as symptomatic of a Postglacial ‘revolution’ involving world-wide population growth and intensification in exploitation of marine resources. However, the comparative rarity of earlier deposits may have as much to do with Postglacial sea-level rise and the loss of evidence from earlier palaeoshorelines as with genuine socio-economic trends. Here we investigate the underwater Mesolithic (Ertebølle) shell midden of Hjarnø Vesterhoved in Denmark, one of the first underwater shell middens to be systematically verified as an anthropogenic shell deposit in a region world-famous for its many hundreds of Ertebølle shell mounds on the present shoreline. We show how a combination of geophysical survey, coring, excavation, stratigraphic interpretation and macroscopic analysis of midden contents can be used to identify underwater deposits, to unravel their taphonomic and post-depositional history in relation to surrounding sediments, and to distinguish between cultural and natural agencies of shell accumulation and deformation. We demonstrate the presence of an intact underwater shell-midden deposit dated at 5400–5100 cal BC, one of the earliest in Denmark. We demonstrate the usefulness of such material in giving new information about early coastal subsistence economies and greater precision to the measurement of palaeo-sea levels. We discuss the implications of our results for an improved understanding of the Mesolithic record in Denmark and of biases in the archaeological record of Late Pleistocene and Early-to-Mid Holocene coastal contexts. We emphasise the importance of researching more fully the geomorphological and taphonomic processes that affect the accumulation, destruction, burial, preservation and visibility of underwater archaeological deposits, the need to extend underwater investigations more widely and to more deeply submerged palaeoshorelines, and the combination of methods required to advance such investigations.","Astrup, P.M.; Benjamin, J.; Stankiewicz, F.; Woo, K.; McCarthy, J.; Wiseman, C.; Baggaley, P.; Jerbic, K.; Fowler, M.; Skriver, C.; Bailey, G.",NULL,"Astrup, Peter Moe, P.M.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2021.106854,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Sea-level changes, Scandinavia, Coastal geomorphology, Submerged landscapes, Marine molluscs, Taphonomy, Geophysical survey, Underwater archaeology",Journal article,NULL,NULL

In addition, we reported the peculiar parasitic association between two hydrozoan species: the polypoid phase (stolon and medusoid buds) of <i>C. octonaria</i> (parasite) and the free-swimming medusa of <i>Liriope</i> <i>tetraphylla</i> (Limnomedusae) (host) over a one-year sampling period (February 2014 to March 2015) in the coasts of Mar del Plata, Argentina. We examined the seasonality, prevalence, and intensity of parasitic infection. Metadata associated with the medusa collection was also used to map areas of seasonality where such association was observed. <i>Cunina octonaria</i> was found from southern Uruguay to the coast of Mar del Plata (34.8–38.2°S, 57.2–54.0°W), with the highest abundances and frequency of occurrence in the Río de la Plata estuary. The parasitic association was identified from the austral warm period (spring-summer season) until midautumn. Out of the 21,734 <i>L. tetraphylla</i> specimens that were examined, 316 were parasitized (prevalence = 1.5%) exclusively in the manubrium and gastric peduncle, with an infection intensity of 1 to 2 stolons per host. Furthermore, the medusoid buds per stolon ranged from 11 and 29 at different stages of development. No significant differences were observed between the umbrella diameter of parasitized and non-parasitized <i>L. tetraphylla</i> specimens, nor was any significant correlation identified between umbrella diameter and prevalence, and intensity of infection. According to the aggregation coefficient, <i>C. octonaria</i> had an overdispersed distribution in the host population. All parasitized hosts showed stomach vacuity due to the location of the stolon, which blocked the mouth of the host. We identified the parasitic association in the coasts of Mar del Plata, as well as in both coasts of the Río de la Plata Estuary (Uruguayan-Argentinean coasts). In the Southwestern Atlantic, several biological interactions between medusae and<br> other groups have been identified; however, the specific host selectivity of <i>C. octonaria</i> for <i>L. tetraphylla</i> was not previously identified. Here we discuss the ecological importance of this association during the holoplanktonic life history of the narcomedusae. Additionally, we report the southern limit of the spatial distribution of this particular parasitic association in the Southwestern Atlantic, thus increasing the knowledge of biological associations of gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidaria and Ctenophora) on Uruguayan and Argentinean coasts.","Puente-Tapia, F.A.; Castiglioni, F.; Siquier, G.F.; Genzano, G.",NULL,"Genzano, Gabriel, G.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.6620/ZS.2020.59-57,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Cunina octonaria, ""Limnomedusae"", ""Liriope tetraphylla"", ""Narcomedusae""",NULL,NULL,"Argentine Sea, Stolon phase, Medusoid buds, Limnomedusae, Narcomedusae",Journal article,NULL,NULL

We studied the new species through light and scanning electron microscopy and discussed its similarity to other members of the genus. The new species has a unique combination of morphological features that allow its separation from all other species in the genus: (1) lanceolate valve outline with cuneate apices, (2) multiseriate striae composed of two to four rows of irregular sized areolae on the rapheless sternum valve (SV), not interrupted at the valve mantle junction, and (3) arrangement of areolae on the valve mantle, grouped in 3 or 4 rows, each composed of 2 to 3 areolae on the SV. Nevertheless, the new species main diagnostic feature is the occurrence of numerous, unusual, small shallow depressions externally located on the SV along the axial area, cavum, and virgae. As a result, <i>P. scrobiculatum</i> is different from similar species under LM and SEM by some evident characters or a combination of characters. This study contributes to the knowledge of the so far understudied biodiversity of microorganisms of tropical regions. In addition, the above-mentioned diversity patterns and the wealth of new diatom taxa inside and around the Colônia basin (many yet to be described) suggest that further samplings from other localities may provide an insight into its habitat preferences and range, since this area is an exceptional biological entity, worthy of further study.","Marquardt, G.C.; Bicudo, D.C.; de Bicudo, C.E.M.; Ledru, M.-P.; Ector, L.; Wetzel, C.E.",NULL,"Marquardt, Gisele, G.C.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.5507/fot.2020.016,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,New species,NULL,"Colônia basin, fossil diatoms, paleolimnology, Planothidium, Pleistocene, South America, taxonomy",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Sampling was carried out near the entrance, the middle and end parts of the creek. During the course of the present study, the Red Sea was characterized by predominantly oligotrophic conditions. Nutrient concentrations were relatively higher in the end part of the creek compared to the two other study sites. Chlorophyll a was also low throughout the year (average: 0.35 ± 0.32 mg m−3), except in May when it showed clear peaks at open-water and middle sites of the creek (1.85 and 1.04 mg m−3, respectively). Phytoplankton abundance followed a similar pattern to that of chlorophyll a with considerably higher abundance at these sites in May (3063.27 × 103 and 1082.34 × 103 individuals m−3, respectively). This unusually higher abundance was mostly due to the proliferation of the diatom <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> cf. <i>delicatissima</i> (Cleve) Heiden. Silicate concentrations were statistically significantly correlated with total phytoplankton. A total of 220 phytoplankton species were recorded during the study period (117 diatoms, 99 dinoflagellates and four cyanophytes). Diatoms dominated in the phytoplankton abundance (75%) and were followed by dinoflagellates (20%), while cyanophytes accounted for a minimal proportion. Of all phytoplankton species observed during the study, 21 diatom and four dinoflagellate species were considered as new records for the Red Sea, and two diatom and 14 dinoflagellate species were listed as harmful algal species worldwide.","El-Sherbiny, M.M.; Al-Harbi, M.A.; Kumar, A.J.",NULL,"Al-Harbi, Mamdouh, M.A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.2478/oandhs-2021-0010,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Phytoplankton, abundance, distribution, Obhur Creek, Red Sea",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Aside from causing issues in taxonomy, incorrect identifications complicate our understanding of species-specific ecological preferences and result in flawed palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and geochemical results. Over the years, a number of studies have grouped together several key Arctic–North Atlantic species in various combinations, despite their distinct environmental preferences and/or stratigraphical differences, causing great confusion in the literature.

In those cases, we recommend the following actions: (i) always strive to make a precise identification and at least differentiate between the three genera; (ii) where <i>C. neoteretis</i> and <i>C. teretis</i> cannot be separated, and where the stratigraphical context does not make the species identification obvious, specimens belonging to these taxa should be reported as <i>C. teretis/C. neoteretis</i>; and (iii) where specimens in a sample cannot be confidently assigned to a specific species of <i>Islandiella</i> or <i>Cassidulina</i>, specimens should be grouped as <i>Islandiella</i> spp. or <i>Cassidulina</i> spp., followed by naming the most dominant species in brackets.

Cone snails are among the largest genera (<i>Conus</i> sp.) of marine invertebrates, with more than seven hundred species described to date. These predatory mollusks use their sophisticated venom apparatus to capture prey or defend themselves. In-depth studies of these venoms have unraveled many biologically active peptides with pharmacological properties of interest in the field of pain management, the treatment of epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiac ischemia. Considering sequencing efficiency and affordability, cone snail venom gland transcriptome analyses could allow the discovery of new, promising antimicrobial peptides. We first present here the need for novel compounds like antimicrobial peptides as a viable alternative to conventional antibiotics. Secondly, we review the current knowledge on cone snails as a source of antimicrobial peptides. Then, we present the current state of the art in analytical methods applied to crude or milked venom followed by how antibacterial activity assay can be implemented for fostering cone snail antimicrobial peptides studies.

Here, eDNA metabarcoding was employed to detect zooplankton species of interest for fisheries from open and coastal waters. High-Throughput sequencing (HTS) from environmental samples using small water volumes has been proposed to detect species of interest whose DNA is the most abundant. We analyzed 6-L water samples taken from subtropical and tropical waters using Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene as metabarcode. In the open ocean, several commercial fish larvae and invertebrate species important in fish diet were found from metabarcodes and confirmed from individual barcoding. Comparing Atlantic, Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Pacific samples we found a lower taxonomic depth of OTU assignments in samples from tropical waters than in those from temperate ones, suggesting large gaps in reference databases for those areas; thus a higher effort of zooplankton barcoding in tropical oceans is highly recommended. This and similar simplified sampling protocols could be applied in early detection of species important for fisheries.","Garcia-Vazquez, E.; Georges, O.; Fernandez, S.; Ardura, A.",NULL,"Georges, Oriane, O.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86731-z,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, knowledge of dirivultid biogeography and phylogeography remains limited, especially in the northwestern Pacific. Here, we obtained partial mitochondrial COI gene sequences of three dirivultids from the northwestern Pacific—<i>Stygiopontius senokuchiae</i> and an unidentified <i>Chasmatopontius</i> species from vent fields in the Izu–Bonin Arc and <i>Stygiopontius senckenbergi</i> associated with the squat lobster <i>Shinkaia crosnieri</i> in the Okinawa Trough—and analyzed them in comparison with existing data.

Each species formed a monophyletic clade and the genetic region targeted is deemed reliable for identifying species and populations for these copepods. Among the three genera targeted, only <i>Chasmatopontius</i> formed a monophyletic cluster, while <i>Aphotopontius</i> and <i>Stygiopontius</i> did not. Species delimitation analyses suggested the existence of cryptic species in <i>Chasmatopontius</i>.

Many studies have found evidence of long distance meiofauna dispersal due to passive transport by wind and/or animals that serve as vectors for these widespread distributions. Our research on an archipelago in northeast Brazil uncovered a species of freshwater gastrotrich that at first sight appeared to be a ‘cosmopolitanʼ species that had surpassed the connectivity constraint to occupy an island more than 350 km from the mainland. However, through an integrative approach using molecular sequences and morphology, we have uncovered evidence of a pseudo-cryptic species in this freshwater gastrotrich. <em>Polymerurus insularis</em> sp. nov. closely resembles its congeners and can easily be mistaken for similar species such as <em>P. nodicaudus</em>, a cosmopolitan gastrotrich. Unique to <em>P. insularis</em> sp. nov. are (1) a cuticular armature composed of simple spined scales with polygonal shape (<em>Type 1</em> scales), (2) a single, spineless dorsal scale with a triangular shape located terminally next to the furca base (<em>Type 2</em> scale), (3) a spineless zone composed by a patch lacking cuticular ornamentation and flat, rounded or polygonal scales without spines (<em>Type 4 </em>scales) (4) particular sets of terminal spined or keeled scales located both dorsally and ventrally around the furca base (<em>Types 3</em>, <em>5</em>, <em>6</em>, <em>7</em> and <em>8</em> scales).

Jellyfish by definition are planktonic and it would be assumed that connectivity would be high among local populations, and that populations would minimally vary in both ecological and genetic clade-level differences over broad spatial scales (i.e., hundreds to thousands of km). Although data exists on the connectivity of scyphozoan jellyfish, there are few data on cubozoans. Cubozoans are capable swimmers and have more complex and sophisticated visual abilities than scyphozoans. We predict, therefore, that cubozoans have the potential to have finer spatial scale differences in population structure than their relatives, the scyphozoans. Here we review the data available on the population structures of scyphozoans and what is known about cubozoans. The evidence from realized connectivity and estimates of potential connectivity for scyphozoans indicates the following. Some jellyfish taxa have a large metapopulation and very large stocks (>1000 s of km), while others have clade-level differences on the scale of tens of km. Data on distributions, genetics of medusa and polyps, statolith shape, elemental chemistry of statoliths and biophysical modelling of connectivity suggest that some of the ~50 species of cubozoans have populations of surprisingly small spatial scales and low levels of connectivity. Despite their classification as plankton, therefore, some scyphozoans and cubozoans have stocks of small spatial scales. Causal factors that influence the population structure in many taxa include the distribution of polyps, behavior of medusa, local geomorphology and hydrodynamics. Finally, the resolution of patterns of connectivity and population structures will be greatest when multiple methods are used.","Kingsford, M.J.; Schlaefer, J.A.; Morrissey, S.J.",NULL,"Kingsford, Michael, M.J.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13040174,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Cubozoa, ""Scyphozoa""",NULL,NULL,"medusa, scyphozoan, cubozoa, population, connectivity, population structure",Journal article,NULL,NULL

We used a self–organizing map, indicator species analysis, linear discriminant analysis and a random forest model to distinguish mollusc assemblages, to determine the ecological preferences of individual mollusc species and to associate major physicochemical variables with mollusc assemblages and occurrences in the Sô River Basin, Benin. We identified four mollusc assemblages along an upstream–downstream gradient. Dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), salinity, calcium (Ca), total nitrogen (TN), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) were the major physicochemical variables responsible for structuring these mollusc assemblages. However, the physicochemical factors responsible for shaping the distribution of individual species varied per species. Upstream sites (assemblage I) showed high DO and low BOD and mineral compounds (i.e., TN, salinity, and Ca), which are primarily responsible for structuring the occurrences of bivalves (<em>Afropisidium pirothi</em>, <em>Etheria elliptica</em>, <em>Sphaerium hartmanni</em>) and the gastropod <em>Lanistes varicus</em>. Sites along the middle reach (assemblage II) were characterised by a high degree of organic pollution but low heavy metal pollution; we detected no specific mollusc indicator species.

Previous studies suggested that gammarids have some capacity to endogenously produce LC-PUFAs.

Our results show that gammarids have, at least, three distinct <span class=""html-italic"">elovl</span> genes with putative roles in LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Phylogenetics allowed us to classify two elongases as Elovl4 and Elovl6, as they were bona fide orthologues of vertebrate Elovl4 and Elovl6. Moreover, a third elongase was named as “Elovl1/7-like” since it grouped closely to the Elovl1 and Elovl7 found in vertebrates. Molecular analysis of the deduced protein sequences indicated that the gammarid Elovl4 and Elovl1/7-like were indeed polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) elongases, whereas Elovl6 had molecular features typically found in non-PUFA elongases. This was partly confirmed in the functional assays performed on the marine gammarid <span class=""html-italic"">Echinogammarus marinus</span> Elovl, which showed that both Elovl4 and Elovl1/7-like elongated PUFA substrates ranging from C<sub>18</sub> to C<sub>22</sub>. <span class=""html-italic"">E. marinus</span> Elovl6 was only able to elongate C<sub>18</sub> PUFA substrates, suggesting that this enzyme does not play major roles in the LC-PUFA biosynthesis of gammarids.","Ribes-Navarro, A.; Navarro, J.C.; Hontoria, F.; Kabeya, N.; Standal, I.B.; Evjemo, J.O.; Monroig, Ó.",NULL,"Hontoria, Francisco, F.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md19040226,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Echinogammarus marinus,NULL,NULL,"Echinogammarus marinus, elovl enzymes, LC-PUFA biosynthesis, functional characterisation, gammarids",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Multiproxy analysis (foraminifera, trace metals and radioisotopes) shows the temporal transformation of these estuaries in response to regional driving forces such as fresh-water discharge, relative sea-level (RSL) variation and the more recent impact of industrial development. At millennial and centennial timescales, the Deba estuary transformed from a tide-dominated to a river-dominated estuary at about 8000 yr cal BP following the decrease in RSL rise rate. This decrease also led to a reduction in both salinity and marine influence in the nearby tide-dominated Urola estuary.

They have commercial value as traditional medicine, curio objects, and pets in the aquarium industry. There are 48 valid species, 27 of which are represented in the international aquarium trade. Most species in the aquarium industry are relatively large and were described early in the history of seahorse taxonomy. In 2002, seahorses became the first marine fishes for which the international trade became regulated by CITES (Convention for the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), with implementation in 2004. Since then, aquaculture has been developed to improve the sustainability of the seahorse trade. This review provides analyses of the roles of wild-caught and cultured individuals in the international aquarium trade of various <i>Hippocampus</i> species for the period 1997–2018. For all species, trade numbers declined after 2011. The proportion of cultured seahorses in the aquarium trade increased rapidly after their listing in CITES, although the industry is still struggling to produce large numbers of young in a cost-effective way, and its economic viability is technically challenging in terms of diet and disease. Whether seahorse aquaculture can benefit wild populations will largely depend on its capacity to provide an alternative livelihood for subsistence fishers in the source countries. For most species, CITES trade records of live animals in the aquarium industry started a few years earlier than those of dead bodies in the traditional medicine trade, despite the latter being 15 times higher in number. The use of DNA analysis in the species identification of seahorses has predominantly been applied to animals in the traditional medicine market, but not to the aquarium trade. Genetic tools have already been used in the description of new species and will also help to discover new species and in various other kinds of applications.","Koning, S.; Hoeksema, B.W.",NULL,"Koning, Sasha, S.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13050187,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Hippocampus,NULL,NULL,"aquaculture, CITES Trade Database, cryptobenthic fishes, FishBase, identification, pygmy seahorses, species discovery, World Register of Marine Species WoRMS)",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Nematode community taxonomic structure, colonizer–persister classes, maturity index (MI), index of trophic diversity (ITD), Shannon–Wiener diversity index (</span></span><em>H′</em>), together with the Hakanson’s Ecological Risk Index, were applied to assess the environmental quality of the investigated stations. The taxonomic structure, MI, ITD, and <em>H′</em> varied among the study stations. In addition to the stochastic causes, variability in environmental variables together with metal concentrations explained, to a certain extent, the observed variations in nematode features. The differentiation in nematode species’ composition was attributed to changes in water depth, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, sediment medium diameter, organic matter, chlorophyll-a and pheophytin-a concentrations, and concentrations of manganese (Mn) and cobalt (Co). Mn was the most influential metal in explaining nematode diversity. MI appeared to be affected more by metals than by other environmental variables. According to the nematode features, the environmental quality ranged from bad to good at the majority of stations, although the rankings varied among different indices. Taxonomic structure, life strategy traits, ITD, and <em>H′</em> were all effective in highlighting the areas subjected to severe metal contamination in the bay, and could provide more comprehensive assessments when used in combination. These indices suggested a more severe pollution status than the results obtained from the Hakanson’s Ecological Risk Index method, and may be more sensitive to ecological quality deterioration.

Despite nematodes great abundances and known ecological roles, molecular tools have not been applied to investigate their species diversity in sea ice. In an attempt to begin establishing a molecular baseline for species diversity of sea ice nematodes, we Sanger sequenced 74 specimens from four locations around Svalbard (European Arctic), using the 18S rRNA barcode. Currently available nucleotide reference databases are both underpopulated with representative marine nematode taxa and contain a substantial number of misidentified organisms. Together, these limitations inhibited the ability to identify marine specimens collected in this study with certainty. Nevertheless, our molecular data indicate the presence of two genera in sea ice on Svalbard—<i>Theristus</i> and <i>Halomonhystera.</i> While it is possible that the latter represents a novel ice nematode species, future studies, including morphometric analysis, are needed to verify our molecular findings. We leverage the assignment of molecular information to robustly identify nematodes and provide the first insight into the diversity of sea ice nematodes in the European Arctic.

In order to understand the ability of other Ponto-Caspian groups to expand and invade other regions, their occurrence and adaptation within areas that can act as a vector need to be understood. Several Ponto-Caspian polychaete species might be capable to become invasive as well. Understanding their ecological tolerances and distribution dynamics in waterways that link them to other regions is therefore imperative to acknowledge their invasive potential. In this study we examine the distribution patterns of three PC polychaete species in the Danube River and delta area in order to assess whether the region might be a corridor for these species to spread into central Europe and beyond. The results revealed that the three studied species greatly vary in distribution and environmental tolerances, but that two of the three show ecological tolerances and distribution range extensions that make them potentially very invasive. Our study provides a baseline for further distribution studies of PC polychaetes and details their habitat requirements. The possibility that the two Ponto-Caspian polychaete species could use the Danube corridor to realise a massive range extension is new and raises several conservation concerns. It is imperative to understand invasive potential and distribution dynamics in order to prepare effective measurements to limit spread of potentially harmful species, such as Ponto-Caspian mussels, mud shrimps and in this case polychaete.","Pavel, A.B.; Menabit, S.; Pop, I.C.; Stanescu, I.; Naliana, L.",NULL,"Pop, Ioan, I.C.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01623,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Polychaeta,NULL,NULL,"Danube River, Danube Delta, Ponto-Caspian Polychaeta",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Using gradient forest analysis, we explored the relative importance of environmental factors, operating across multiple spatio-temporal scales, in influencing patterns of compositional turnover in estuarine benthic macroinvertebrate communities across New Zealand. Both land-derived stressors (represented by sediment mud content and total sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content) and natural environmental variables (represented by sea surface temperature, Southern Oscillation Index, and wind-wave exposure) were important predictors of compositional turnover, reflecting a matrix of processes interacting across space and time. Generalized linear models were used to determine whether measures of benthic macroinvertebrate diversity, which are commonly used as indicators of ecological health on a local scale, changed in a way that was consistent with the compositional turnover along the environmental gradient. As expected, compositional turnover along land-derived stressor gradients was negatively associated with diversity indices, suggesting a decline in ecological health as land-derived stressors increase.

Studies about their occurrence, abundance, and distribution in Venezuela are focused in the central-eastern coasts; hence the aim of this study is to describe the echinoderm community in the north-western coast of the Gulf of Venezuela. Samples were collected from three sites in the Venezuelan Guajira Peninsula (Castilletes, Porshoure, and Kazuzain) where patchy coral reefs and seagrass meadows are abundant. According to the substrate, two methods were performed using quantitative (1 m² quadrates), and qualitative free-diving observations. All organisms were counted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level; finally, diversity (Shannon diversity index), richness (number of species), and dominance in the different sampled substrates were recorded. The updated list of echinoderms of the Gulf of Venezuela reported in this research, includes 20 genera, 15 families, 10 orders, four classes, and 28 species. The richest class was Ophiuroidea, with 18 species, followed by Asteroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea, with three species each. Castilletes was the sampling site with the higher number of species (18 species), followed by Porshoure (15 species), and lastly Kazuzain (12 species). Our observations indicate that the number of species and abundance were higher when found in coral reefs (21 species, 80.69% of the total collected individuals) in contrast to the species found in seagrass beds (16 species, 19.31% of the total of individuals collected). This updated list of echinoderms represents 11.54% of the total diversity of the phylum in the marine areas from the coast of Venezuela; it is suggested that this percentage is greatly influenced by the differences of habitats and substrates alongside the north-western coast in the Gulf of Venezuela.","Espinoza-Rodríguez, N.E.; Pernía, Y.; Severeyn, H.; García de Severeyn, Y.; Barrios-Garrido, H.",NULL,"Barrios-Garrido, Hector, H.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.11606/1807-0205/2021.61.51,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Echinodermata,NULL,NULL,"Marine invertebrates, Venezualan Guajira Peninsula, Coral reefs, Seagrass beds ",Journal article,NULL,NULL

A severe knowledge gap in the shallow benthic diversity exists for the tropical Indian Ocean, especially along the coastline of peninsular India. Latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG)—a poleward decrease in diversity, even though accepted as a pervasive global pattern, often differs from regional trends. Although several oceanographic variables are known to influence regional patterns, their relative effect in shaping the shallow benthic community in tropical seas remains unclear. The east coast of India bordering the Bay of Bengal (BoB) presents a 2,500 km stretch (8–22°N) of tropical coastline with a spatial variation in oceanographic parameters including freshwater mixing, primary productivity, temperature, and shelf area. Here, we documented the marine bivalve distribution using spatially-temporally averaged beach samples and evaluated their relationship with the oceanographic variables. Our data reveal the existence of a highly diverse fauna, comparable to other tropical shallow marine sites. Overall species composition reflects a typical assemblage of the Indian Ocean, dominated by Veneridae but shows an uncharacteristically low proportion of Tellinidae and Lucinidae. The latitudinal variation in diversity shows a mid-latitude drop at around 14°N—a pattern inconsistent with the prediction of latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG). The functional groups are dominated by infauna (65%), unattached groups (69%), and suspension feeders (87%). There is only a slight difference in species composition between southern and the northern sites pointing to a predominantly continuous circulation and considerable mixing within the BoB. Productivity range, shelf area, and salinity emerge as best predictors of the species richness. All environmental variables together explain the species composition across the latitudinal bins satisfactorily. The species composition of the east coast shows no distinct nature in comparison to the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot; the proximity to this hotspot and biological exchange with it may have contributed to the high diversity of the east coast fauna.

These marine crustaceans inhabit the tropical and subtropical coasts of the world, yet some also appear in temperate climates. Their adults are specialized for digging and living in sandy substrates. Hippoidean zoea-type larvae are planktic and reach large sizes up to a few centimetres. These larvae transform into megalopa larvae, strongly resembling the adult, mediating the transition to the benthic lifestyle of the adult. We reconstructed outlines in dorsal view of over 80 shields of hippoideans, including representatives of Blepharipodidae (sister group to all others), Albuneidae, and Hippidae and including adults, megalopa-type, and zoea-type larvae from all three ingroups. We conducted a morphological analysis on this data using an elliptic Fourier transformation and principal component analysis. We used the results of the analysis to discuss the life history of hippoideans and the special function of megalopae, which often lack emphasis in current research. Early stage zoea larvae, megalopae, and adults show a linear gradient in their morphological development according to our analysis. However, late stage zoea larvae deviate from this pattern, possibly due to their specialization to a long-lasting planktic life.

We hypothesized that a sub-surface thermal inversion phenomenon and associated hydrographical changes during winter monsoon promoted group/species-specific epibiosis among the plankton in the western Bay of Bengal. Plankton samples were collected from discrete depths along five transects placed perpendicular to the coast. Water column profiling revealed thermal inversion below the mixed layer depth along three southern transects (APB, APV and APK) and its absence along the two northern transects (ODP and ODG). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant difference in hydrographical properties between these areas. The warmer, highly saline waters of the thermal inversion layer, sandwiched at 10–20 m, between the colder, less saline waters of surface and bottom, supported higher density and diversity of epibionts on copepods and diatoms. The density of epibionts and intensity of epibiosis were significantly lower outside the thermal inversion layer and in the northern transects. Epibionts preferred copepods over diatoms and carnivorous/omnivorous copepods over herbivorous copepods of comparable size. These results suggest that hydrographical variability associated with thermal inversion during winter monsoon support epibiosis among the plankton in the coastal waters of the western Bay of Bengal (BoB). The present investigation is the first-ever study from a coastal marine ecosystem connecting hydrographical features with epibiosis among the plankton. Further studies are warranted to explore the higher frequency of epibiosis in the thermal inversion layer, the nutrient preference and indicator properties of epibionts, and their ecological role in the coastal and open ocean ecosystems.","Siddique, A.; Bhowal, A.; Purushothaman, J.; Madhusoodhanan, R.; Raghunathan, C.; Chandra, K.",NULL,"Siddique, Alfisa, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107914,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Epibiont, Thermal inversion, Winter monsoon, Ocean stratification, Bay of Bengal, Tropical waters",Journal article,NULL,NULL

An exception is modern Europe, where descendants of ancient adaptive radiations went extinct, and extant adaptive radiations are small, recent and narrowly confined. However, not all legacy of old radiations has been lost. Subterranean environments, which are dark and food-deprived, yet buffered from climate change, have preserved ancient lineages. Here we provide evidence of an entirely subterranean adaptive radiation of the amphipod genus <i>Niphargus</i>, counting hundreds of species. Our modelling of lineage diversification and evolution of morphological and ecological traits using a time-calibrated multilocus phylogeny suggests a major adaptive radiation, comprised of multiple subordinate adaptive radiations. Their spatio-temporal origin coincides with the uplift of carbonate massifs in South-Eastern Europe 15 million years ago. Emerging subterranean environments likely provided unoccupied, predator-free space, constituting ecological opportunity, a key trigger of adaptive radiation. This discovery sheds new light on the biodiversity of Europe.","Borko, S.; Trontelj, P.; Seehausen, O.; Moškric, A.; Fišer, C.",NULL,"Trontelj, Peter, P.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24023-w,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

As a result, it became necessary to study modern composition of fish fauna and indicators of its species richness and diversity. The Laspi Bay was chosen as a model polygon for the following reasons: relatively low level of anthropogenic load; the fact that its part belongs to the specially protected natural areas, as well as the absence of fishing activity with coastal fixed fishing gear; constant free entry of pelagic fish species; biotopes diversity; and smooth change in depth. These peculiarities of the Laspi Bay allow assessing the presence of fish from different ecological groups and provide conditions for monitoring. The study was carried out in the spring-autumn periods of 1990–1994 and 2017–2018. The material was sampled with net fishing gear, hook tackle, and traps. The nets were set at various depths both perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline during the day (10:00 to 18:00) and at nighttime (18:00 to 06:00). Visual observations were also carried out. In total, 70 fish species were registered. Out of them, 14 species were previously not recorded for this area; 5 of them [salema Sarpa salpa (Linnaeus, 1758), red-mouthed goby <i>Gobius cruentatus</i> Gmelin, 1789, Bath’s goby <i>Pomatoschistus bathi</i> Miller, 1982, mystery blenny <i>Parablennius incognitus</i> (Bath, 1968), and chestnut goby <i>Chromogobius quadrivittatus</i> (Steindachner, 1863)] are recent invaders, actively spreading in the Black Sea over the past 15–20 years only. Most of the analyzed species (64) are marine euryhaline fish. The brackish-water group is represented by three species, indigenous to the Black Sea: mushroom goby <i>Ponticola eurycephalus</i> (Kessler, 1874), round goby <i>Neogobius melanostomus</i> (Pallas, 1814), and knout goby <i>Mesogobius batrachocephalus</i> (Pallas, 1814). Out of anadromous fish, starry sturgeon <i>Acipenser stellates</i> Pallas, 1771 is registered, as well as two Clupeidae species: Black Sea shad <i>Alosa tanaica</i> (Grimm, 1901) and Pontic shad <i>Alosa immaculata</i> Bennett, 1835. As established, the observed seasonal dynamics of species diversity indices within the studied water area is associated with fluctuations in the abundance of horse mackerel <i>Trachurus mediterraneus</i> (Steindachner, 1868). In April – May, when this species headed to shallow water for feeding and breeding, the indices have the lowest values; in August, when the abundance of horse mackerel decreases, the maximum values are observed.","Abliazov, E.R.; Boltachev, A.R.; Karpova, E.P.; Pashkov, A.N.; Danilyuk, O.N.",NULL,"Abliazov, E.R.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.21072/mbj.2021.06.2.01,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Black Sea, Laspi Bay, fish fauna, composition, abundance, species richness, diversity, invaders",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Herein, the most upto-dated comprehensive inventory and the broad-scale baseline of the soft-sediment macrozoobenthos in semi-enclosed coastal systems (SECS) of the Moroccan Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts (3500 km) is presented. In total, 496 species (7 phyla, 21 classes, 65 orders and 201 families) were recorded among which 95 species were exclusively Mediterranean, 99 species were Atlantic–Mediterranean and 302 species exclusively Atlantic. The best multivariate model, explaining 33% of the total variation observed in benthic assemblages’ composition, included the type of the SECS (estuaries vs lagoons vs bay), the marine ecoregion (Atlantic vs Mediterranean), the surface of the SECS and the environmental features (minimal temperature, minimal and maximal salinity) as predictors of benthic macrofauna composition in the Moroccan SECS. In contrast to the general latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) pattern, our results showed that species richness and taxonomic diversity showed no relationship with latitude. Such differences in benthic macrofaunal composition across a large scale could result from the fact that each ecosystem has its own specific characteristics, which implies an individualistic approach to ecosystem ecology. The sample of the 12 SECS considered in this study covers most of the range of variation along the coasts of Morocco. The current compilation is relevant in such poorly known area at the global scale and fulfills a knowledge gap on benthic macrofauna in SECS of the Southern part of the North-Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean ecoregions.

Here, we systematically collected samples for 9 months (from April to December 2018) in the coastal waters of Xiaoping Island in China to analyze the planktonic community structure and identify the main driving environmental factors along the nutrient gradient from the sewage outlet to the open sea. The results indicated that there existed obvious seasonal and spatial variations in the planktonic community. Procrustes test analysis showed that temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, nitrate (NO3eN), phosphate (PO4eP), and silicate (SiO3eSi) significantly affected the community compositions and diversity of plankton (p < 0.05). Co-occurrence network showed that seasons and nutrients pollution had an important influence on the inter-specific interactions between phytoplankton and mesozooplankton. In different nutrient pollution gradients, diatom was the most associated with Copepods in Section 1 (9.38%), Section 2 (9.84%), and Section 3 (5.38%), respectively, and it was also associated with Planktonic larva in Section 1 (7.81%), followed by in Section 3 (4.30%) and 2 (1.64%).

A literature review of taxonomic and ecological studies of pycnogonids from Mexico identified 49 nominal species (~3.6% out of 1,335 species described worldwide). This low species richness is likely caused by limited taxonomic research and intermittent sampling and research efforts initially carried out by foreign scientists (1893–1996) and later by Mexican scientists.

This study investigated the diversity and abundance of tidepool fishes on a rocky shore from Bangladesh. Fish samples were collected from the east and west coasts of St. Martin’s Island between November 2018 and March 2019. There were 441 specimens distributed in 23 species belonging to 20 genera and 14 families. Among those, 11 species represented new records for Bangladesh, namely <i>Allenbatrachus reticulatus</i>, <i>Bathygobius coalitus</i>, <i>Bathygobius curacao</i>, <i>Callogobius hasseltii</i>, <i>Crenimugil crenilabis</i>, <i>Halichoeres nigrescens</i>, <i>Istigobius decorates</i>, <i>Istigobius ornatus</i>, <i>Ostorhinchus cookie</i>, <i>Siganus sutor</i> and <i>Yongeichthys nebulosus</i>. The most speciose families were Gobiidae (6 species), Pomacentridae (3 species) and Blenniidae (2 species), and in terms of number of individuals, Gobiidae (42%) and Blenniidae (38%) were abundant. The mean abundance of fish in tidepools was decreasing with increasing intertidal elevations (i.e. lower > middle > upper intertidal zones), although the differences were not significant. Moreover, fish abundance and diversity were positively correlated with the surface area of tidepool. Six species were common in the sampling sites, and the east coast of St. Martin’s Island had higher species richness and diversity than the west coast. Temperature (31.8 ± 2.9 °C), salinity (31.8 ± 2.1‰) and pH (8.3 ± 0.1) of the tidepool waters were comparable to those reported for a range of rocky/reef environments across the Asia–Pacific region.

Intensive human use of beaches has a negative effect on benthic communities as it alters species abundance, diversity, and/or distribution. Here, we report the impacts of recreational activities (trampling and vehicles) on meiobenthic communities and nematode assemblages on Amazonian sandy beaches for the first time. For this purpose, samples were carried out in four consecutive months encompassing a period of high visitation peak (one month Before Vacation, During Vacation, and two months After Vacation) on three contrasting beaches regarding disturbances (Urban: Atalaia; Intermediary: Farol-Velho; and Protected: Corvinas) at seven equidistant sampling stations (50 m apart) from the high tide water mark to the swash zone. At each sampling station, three biological samples and sediments samples were collected haphazardly. Also, in each station, the sediment compaction was determined using a manual penetrometer. Overall, physical sediment variables (grain size, sorting) were constant over time in all beaches, whereas differences in intensity of recreational activities and sediment compaction were found between beaches and months. Sediment compaction was considered the most important factor for the differences observed in meiofauna community structure in the study areas, and it was related to intensity of recreational activities. Variations in density and changes in richness between periods were observed in Atalaia and Farol-Velho beaches. On the other hand, Corvinas beach remained the same throughout the study. In the first month after vacation, density and richness were similar to those in the period before vacation, thus indicating that the beaches had recovered in one month. Furthermore, vulnerabilities of Tardigrada and Copepoda, as well as of the Nematoda genera <i>Daptonema</i>, and <i>Chromadorita</i>, indicate that they might be potential indicators of recreational activities.","Santos, T.M.T.; Petracco, M.; Venekey, V.",NULL,"Santos, T.M.T.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105289,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Nematoda,NULL,NULL,"Amazon coast, Benthic fauna, Human-induced impacts, Sandy beach",Journal,NULL,NULL

They originated in the early 1900s (Annandale, 1907; Ritchie, 1910, Thornely, 1916, Gravely, 1927), focussing on the taxonomy of hydroids in the 1960s along the southern coast, including Lakshadweep and Andaman Islands (Mammen, 1963, 1965a, b) and in the 1980s along the northern coast (Venugopalan &amp;&nbsp;Wagh, 1986). Species of the hydrozoan family Cladonematidae (Anthoathecata; Capitata) include benthic, creeping and swimming hydroids comprising four genera <em>viz</em>., <em>Cladonema</em>, <em>Eleutheria</em>, <em>Staurocladia</em> and the <em>nomen dubium</em> <em>Dendronema</em> (Schuchert, 2021). <em>Cladonema</em> differs from other genera of Cladonematidae by the branched tentacles either with an adhesive structure or cnidocytes and having nematocysts in oral knobs (Ghory<em> et al.</em>, 2020 &amp; Farias <em>et al.</em>, 2020).

However, experimental choices made when generating eDNA data can impact biodiversity surveys and must be carefully considered during study design. Here, we explored the impact of DNA extraction protocol and metabarcode choice on recovery of meiofauna DNA from sand. We extracted DNA from untreated sand and from sand treated with either Ludox or MgCl2 and amplified DNA using the 18S and CO1 metabarcodes. We found differences in species composition and richness both between metabarcodes and among sampling strategies, confirming the sensitivity of the experiments to both parameters.

Benthic cartography represents the first step of marine spatial planning for the proper management and protection of our sea. Univocal habitat classification systems are thus needed to map, monitor, and inventory marine habitats, and to guarantee common and shared frames for a harmonized interpretation of the Mediterranean habitat types. In this paper we reviewed the existing classification systems of marine benthic habitats, to discuss the process of revision and updating of one of the first system developed under the Barcelona Convention (BC) in 1998 and adopted by all the Mediterranean countries. The BC classification was revised including the new habitats discovered in the last 30 years, and consistently with the criteria used to revise the EUropean Nature Information System (EUNIS), which is a comprehensive pan-European system for habitat identification. The updated BC classification is hierarchical with 5 levels, which allows representing the most suitable habitat level with respect to the restitution scale of the map. Each habitat is univocally identified by an alpha-numeric code, name and general description following the bionomic approach traditionally adopted in the Mediterranean benthic cartography since the late nineteen century. The new BC classification lists 128 main habitats up to the level 4, which may also contain sub-habitats at the level 5, i.e. associations and facies, totalising 394 habitat types (54% of new habitats with respect to the first BC classification). The updated BC classification system has been used for the selection of reference marine habitats that support two fundamental processes of environmental management: i) identification of Specially Marine Protected Areas according to the SPA/BD Protocol of Barcelona Convention; ii) selection of habitats to be monitored, as requested by the Integrated Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the European Directives (e.g., Water Framework and Marine Strategy). The new list of reference habitats, selected because of their high ecological and conservation value, contains 267 habitats, corresponding to 68% of the total habitats listed in the updated BC classification.","Montefalcone, M.; Tunesi, L.; Ouerghi, A.",NULL,"Montefalcone, Monica, M.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105387,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Benthic habitat classifications; Mapping; Bionomy; Reference marine habitat types; Barcelona convention; EUNIS; Mediterranean sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

They have highly effective cuticular chewing and filtering structures in the stomach, which are regularly renewed by moulting. Decapods produce a broad range of digestive enzymes including chitinases, cellulases, and collagenases with unique properties. These enzymes are synthesized in the F-cells of the hepatopancreas and are encoded in the genome as pre-pro-proteins. In contrast to mammals, they are stored in a mature form in the lumen of the stomach to await the next meal, and therefore, the enzymes are particularly stable. The fat emulsifiers are fatty acyl-dipeptides rather than bile salts. After mechanical and chemical processing of the food in the cardiac stomach, the chyme is filtered by two unique filter systems of different mesh-size. The filtrate is then transferred to the hepatopancreas where the nutrients are absorbed by the R-cells, mostly via carriers, resembling nutrient absorption in the small intestine of mammals. The absorbed nutrients are used to fuel the metabolism of the hepatopancreas, are supplied to other organs, and are stored in the R-cells as glycogen and lipid reserves. Export lipids are secreted from the R-cells into the haemolymph as high density lipoproteins that mainly consist of phospholipids. In contrast to mammals, the midgut tube and hindgut contribute only little to food processing and nutrient absorption. The oesophagus, stomach and hindgut are well innervated but the hepatopancreas lacks nerves. Hormone cells are abundant in the midgut and hepatopancreas epithelia. Microorganisms are often present in the intestine of decapods, but they are apparently not essential for digestion and nutrition.","Vogt, G.",NULL,"Vogt, Günter, G.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2021.125945,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Decapoda,NULL,NULL,digestive tract; Decapoda; enzyme synthesis; food processing; nutrient absorption,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Moreover, nematodes showed a significant decline in individual weight. The collected nematodes were taxonomically identified and assigned to five functional traits: shapes of the tail and amphid, life history, feeding types, and adult length. The nematode traits were affected by the number of shrimp introduced, and descriptors followed normal or inversed bell-shaped curves.

Unlike other modern cephalopods, octopodoids leave behind a characteristic drill hole on their molluscan and crustacean prey. These traces provide a means to track their presence and behaviour in deep time. Although severely understudied, some of such holes have been documented from the Eocene–Pleistocene fossil record. We document the oldest recognized drill holes attributed to octopodoids, found in lucinid bivalves from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) of South Dakota, USA. These observations demonstrate that the drilling habit of these animals evolved early in the evolutionary history of Octopodoidea, ~25 Myr earlier than was previously known. The drilled lucinids lived in cold methane seeps in the Western Interior Seaway. These predation traces have never been found in fossil seeps previously, thus adding a new predator to the food web of cold seeps.

The burrow symbiosis of alpheid shrimps is poorly studied in the context of ecology, probably because the cryptic infaunal nature of the relationship is hard to observe.

The average time taken for <i>S. anacanthus</i> to enter the burrow for the first time was much shorter (1 min) than that of <i>A. japonicus</i> (13 min). Subsequently, <i>S. anacanthus</i> made longer use of the burrow (80% of the observation period) than <i>A. japonicus</i> (49%). The tail-first exit frequency, which may indicate a sudden expulsion from the burrow by the host, was more frequent in <i>A. japonicus</i> (25%) than in <i>S. anacanthus</i> (7%). Such differences could be attributed to the nature of the symbiotic relationship, obligate in <i>S. anacanthus</i> but facultative in <i>A. japonicus</i>.

In bivalves, tentacles are morphologically diverse, performing protective and sensory roles in taxa from different ecological niches. Such diversity is particularly accentuated in Pteriomorphia, a clade comprising scallops, oysters, file clams, and relatives. However, little is known about the evolution of these organs and their role in bivalve radiation. To test hypotheses of convergent tentacular evolution and a possible association between tentacles and body orientation on the substrate, we first examined tentacle morphology in 108 preserved species representing 15 families across Pteriomorphia. Morphological descriptions of tentacle type (inner mantle fold tentacles, IFT; middle mantle fold tentacles, MFT) and position (marginal and submarginal) are provided, expanding the knowledge of less studied bivalve taxa. Then, we placed the morphological dataset under a molecular phylogenetic framework to estimate ancestral states. IFT had likely four independent origins, while MFT emerged twice independently. After being gained, tentacles have not been lost. In addition, evolution of MFT coincides with transitions in body position with the midsagittal plane parallel to the substrate in the clades of scallops (Pectinida) and oysters (Ostreida). Such a shift could be related to the increase of mantle exposure, favoring the emergence of serially repeated organs, such as tentacles. Altogether, our results support the convergent evolution of tentacles across different taxonomic levels, corroborating the plasticity of the molluscan body and the relevance of evolutionary convergences in the radiation of bivalves.","Audino, J.A.; Serb, J.M.; Marian, J.E.A.R.",NULL,"Marian, José Eduardo, J.E.A.R.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13127-021-00482-3,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Bivalvia, ""Mollusca"", ""Pteriomorphia""",NULL,NULL,"Bivalves, Evolutionary convergence, Mollusca, Morphology, Phylogeny, Sensory",Journal article,NULL,NULL

The analysis showed that the greatest spatial variation in total mollusc, gastropod and bivalve diversity occurred among different substrates within individual localities, with minor differences among assemblages with increasing spatial scale reflecting the relative homogeneity of the molluscan fauna in the study area. While the gastropods <em>Conus nux</em>, <em>Steironepion piperatum</em> and <em>Muricopsis zeteki</em> accounted for differences among different regions, and <em>Vermicularia pellucida eburnea</em> and <em>Bostrycapulus aculeatus</em> accounted for differences among states, the abundances of <em>M. zeteki</em>, <em>B. aculeatus</em> and <em>V. pellucida eburnea</em> were related to differences in diversity at the scale of individual localities. Among bivalves, <em>Leiosolenus aristatus</em>, <em>L. plumula</em> and <em>Gastrochaena ovata</em> accounted for differences between regions, states and localities, respectively. Overall, the study shows that species composition is influenced by both the substrate and the geographical location of assemblages. This indicates that conservation strategies should address preserving habitat heterogeneity at local scales in the study area.","Barrientos-Lujan, N.A.; Rodríguez-Zaragoza, F.A.; López-Pérez, A.",NULL,"Barrientos-Lujan, Norma, N.A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyab004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This article presents results from my reexamination of all shell artifacts from Mound 72, including some new artifact identifications, bead counts, and measurements. Artifacts previously called gorgets are shell cups, and one was remarkably large. The source was probably the eastern Gulf of Mexico for most marine shells. I present a new method of examining bead drill holes using the frustum formula, suggesting that porcupine quills or biological materials were used as drill tips for columella beads. This method can be used on stone and bone beads as well. I hypothesize a general decline in bead crafting through time. Paired shell artifact emplacements throughout Mound 72 echo the paired male/female human interments from the Beaded Burial, adding to evidence that Mound 72's burials were part of a ritual theater.

Most predatory drill holes are caused by gastropods, but octopods within Octopodoidea also produce characteristic drill holes, yet remain severely understudied in deep time. Consequently, studies comparing octopodoid versus gastropod drill holes from the same prey group are exceedingly rare. Cypraeid gastropod (cowries) are commonly drilled by octopodoids today, but nothing is known about drill holes produced by octopodoids and gastropod in fossil cypraeids. We studied 2406 Plio-Pleistocene fossil cowries from southern Florida, USA. Drilling by octopodoids was common (13.4% of specimens), whereas gastropod drill holes were rare (0.2%). There is strong site selectivity: most octopodoid drill holes are found in the ventral-left-posterior and ventral-left-middle shell regions. These parts are not the thinnest regions of the shell, but represent the location where the columellar muscle anchors the soft tissue to the shell interior. We suggest that the octopodoids sought to paralyze and relax this muscle via the drill hole to minimize the time to consumption. Specimens with multiple octopodoid drill holes (24.1% of drilled specimens) have a higher proportion of drill holes located outside the ventral-left-posterior and ventral-left-middle regions. Thus, drilling outside these regions appears less effective. The few gastropod drill holes occur on the dorsal side. A meta-analysis shows that octopodoids produce significantly more drill holes per drilled molluscan shell than do gastropod drillers. We found mixed evidence for size selectivity: whereas the size of drilled specimens does not significantly differ from non-drilled specimens, drill-hole size is significantly larger in larger cowries, which may imply they were drilled by larger octopodoid individuals. We suggest that the molluscan fossil record should be leveraged to further study the evolution of octopodoid predation and behavior.","Klompmaker, A.A.; Kittle, B.A.",NULL,"Kittle, B.

Despite the volume of hydroid research focused on the northwest Atlantic, the only comprehensive examinations of hydroids from Cape Breton Island were published by Charles McLean Fraser in 1913 and 1927. In this study, we reexamined the shallow-water hydroid community of Cape Breton. We collected hydroids from 19 sites between July 2016 and June 2017 spanning intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. We sorted specimens into individual taxa based on morphology and then preserved them for further morphological and molecular analyses. We amplified the 16SrRNA barcoding gene for select specimens and used BLAST searches to determine the strongest matches in GenBank. We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to refine identifications where necessary. We recorded 19 hydroid taxa spanning 15 genera, 10 families, and 2 orders. Species diversity was low relative to other NW Atlantic regions, likely due to sporadic sampling and our focus on nearshore, shallow-water localities.

Ascaridoid nematodes in mesopelagic fish (Cape Verde - Bay of Biscay areas): ecological and food safety perspectives. MSc Thesis. University of Bergen, Department of Biological Sciences: Bergen. 68 pp.","The total amount of mesopelagic fish biomass is estimated to be between 1 and 20 billion tons globally. However, there is currently no industrial fishery for them. As the sustainability of harvesting pelagic fishes and the health constraint of replacing marine lipids/proteins with land-based lips/proteins in the feed for farming fish seem to have reach their limits, there is an increasing interest of exploitation of mesopelagic fishes from fishing companies and fish feed producers. Although, some anisakid ascaridoid nematodes (some Anisakis and Pseudoterranova spp.) infect many marine teleosts worldwide and are causative agents of a fish-borne zoonotic disease to humans known as anisakidosis. This gastrointestinal disease may result from ingestion of live larvae with lightly cooked or raw fishery products. The Anisakis species A. simplex (s.s.) and A. pegreffii may also cause allergic reactions in sensitized patients. Considering mesopelagic fish as new fish recourse, it is then important to know their ecological role as well as the possible health risks that may be associated with ascaridoid parasites. In May 2019, a research cruise was carried out from Cape Verde to the Bay of Biscay, trawling mesopelagic fish. A total of 1271 fish specimens of 32 fish species were sampled for the presence of ascaridoids. From these, 13 species were found infected with a total of 177 ascaridoid individuals, all larvae. Molecular identification (Cox2, ITS) suggests the larvae to belong to 8 different species: Anisakis pegreffii, A. typica, A. ziphidarum, A. brevispiculata, A. paggiae, A. cf. paggiae, Pseudoterranova cf. ceticola and Raphidascarididae sp. Diretmus argenteus and Diaphus rafinesquii were the most infected fish species with an ascaridoid prevalence of 78% and 36%, respectively. The total density was estimated at 71 ascaridoids/Kg fish. It appears that there is a high diversity of ascaridoid nematodes in mesopelagic fish and that these are likely important transport hosts in the life cycle of these parasites. Results suggest the existence of spatial variation in the abundance and diversity of ascaridoids in mesopelagic fish i.e. D. argenteus. In the perspective of food safety, the potential presence of i.e. A. simplex thermostable cross-allergens in mesopelagic fishes should be considered if derived products are meant to be destined as feed for farmed fish.","Olsen, K.M.",NULL,"Olsen, Kaja, K.M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

Especially the decline and loss of sea ice, but also the increasing inflow of Atlantic Water into the Arctic Ocean or the northward shift of sea-ice formation, are studied processes related to climate change. Those physical changes will undoubtedly affect the Arctic marine ecosystem. Our knowledge of this unique ecosystem, though, is still incomplete, which makes it difficult to assess the consequences of ongoing climate change. More recently, the research focus has been on the importance of ice algae and phytoplankton for the Arctic marine food web. As the main primary producers, they constitute an important food source for many ice-associated (sympagic) species that rely on the ice-algal bloom in spring and the phytoplankton bloom in summer. Sympagic species are important transmitters of carbon from the sea-ice to pelagic and benthic communities. In order to assess the consequences of environmental changes for sympagic communities, we need to broaden our basic understanding of underlying ecosystem functions, such as biomass or carbon cycling.","Ehrlich, J.",NULL,"Ehrlich, Julia, J.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Arctic Ocean; pack ice; zooplankton; meiofauna; ecosystem; biodiversity; Eurasian Basin; carbon flux,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

Development of automated nucleic acid technologies for marine point of sample diagnostics. PhD Thesis. University of Southampton; Faculty of Engineering, Science and Mathematics; School of Ocean and Earth Sciences: Southampton. 150 pp.","Unsafe water, poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation are responsible for about 90% of diarrheal associated deaths worldwide, which are the second leading cause of death in children under five, globally (1.2 million deaths in 2005). The economic cost associated with unsafe water is also significant, with the World Bank estimating that a lack of access to safe water and sanitation amount to equivalent global economic losses of US$260 billion, annually. Coastal communities also face challenges from harmful algal blooms, which deplete oxygen and essential nutrients, and produce toxins that threaten human health; this impacts on locally important industries such as aquaculture, mariculture, leisure and tourism. Current, widely used methods for the detection of biological hazards in water sources rely on culturing or visual inspection of water samples via light microscopy. These techniques are time consuming, require well stocked laboratories and expensive equipment, are dependent on highly trained technical staff, and are often unable to differentiate morphologically similar organisms. Molecular techniques, on the other hand can provide better discrimination between related taxonomical groups, and are suited for miniaturisation and automation, enabling the analysis to be undertaken outside of the laboratory, and by minimally trained personnel.  Recent advances in microfluidic technologies have demonstrated that molecular-biology techniques (e.g. genetic sequence amplification and detection) can be applied using lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems for testing samples for the target organisms at the ‘point of sample’ or ‘point of care’. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) are particularly attractive for LOC applications as, unlike the current gold standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), they require simple, isothermal heating and a generally lower reaction temperature. NASBA is also attractive for LOC-based methods targeting RNA (e.g. RNA viruses) as it directly amplifies RNA removing the need for an additional reverse transcription step. This study indicates several, novel advances towards the provision of point of sample genetic testing for a range of harmful microorganisms and viruses. For the first time, the isothermal amplification of a fragment of the Hepatitis E virus using NASBA is reported with comparable sensitivity to a clinically relevant PCR-based assay. Further, amplification of a fragment of the Alexandrium minutum ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 rRNA gene region via RPA was achieved with a limit of detection of 10 cells exceeding the required sensitivity of 40 cells L-1 for statutory A. minutum surveillance in seawater. In addition to this, two methods for the long-term, dry storage of amplification reagents are presented. Trehalose and sucrose sugars combined with lyophilisation were sufficient to retain reagent activity after storage for four weeks at room temperature. Air drying in the presence of pullulan maintained reagent functionality for six weeks. Alongside these advances, a portable, handheld prototype concept for nucleic acid amplification was developed and tested, with the A. minutum ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 RPA assay being successfully performed on the handheld device achieving the same sensitivity as when performed on laboratory equipment. These advances demonstrate that nucleic acid amplification on a miniaturised device is possible, and that in future, rapid, specific and sensitive testing for harmful species may be able to be performed at the point of sample by non-technically trained operators.","Wilson, M.",NULL,"Wilson, Matthew, M.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

An integrated framework for estimating the number of classes with application for species estimation. PhD Thesis. Trinity College Dublin, School of Computer Science : Dublin. xxii, 234 pp.","The two most common approaches for estimating the number of distinct classes within a population are either to use sampling data directly with combinatorial arguments or to extrapolate historical discovery data. However, in the former case, such detailed sampling data is often unavailable, while the latter approach makes assumptions on the form of parametric curves used to fit the discovery data, that are often lacking in theoretical justification. Instead, we propose an integrated transdisciplinary framework that dissolves the boundaries between the above two approaches. This is achieved by directly describing the samplingdiscovery process in parallel with describing a co-variate latent e&#8629;ort process, where we have historical discovery data for the former process and some proxy data for the latent process. The linkage between these two processes allows one to form data on sampling records by forcing some constraints on how many samples were taken over time. Due to the nature of the constrained data, many inference techniques become infeasible. However, simulation-based methods such as Approximate Bayesian Computation remain available. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and analysed through many simulation experiments, and finally applied in the ecology field to estimate the number of species as an example of the number of classes problem.","Al-Ghamdi, A.",NULL,"Al-Ghamdi, Asmaa, A.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD

The species is dioecious with external fertilization and without sexual dimorphism. The aim of this work was to optimize broodstock conditioning, induce spawning and describe embryonic development until the early larval stage in a hatchery. Broodstock were conditioned at 3 treatments (with/without sand; water circulation) for 48 days. The clams were fed with a mixed diet of macroalgae, with a daily ration of 250,000 cells/ml. Broodstock response was quantified using condition index and gonad development stages (histological techniques). For spawning induction, physical and biological methods were tested. The best response was achieved in males with physical induction. Histological analysis showed that the water circulation system treatment exhibited the highest percentage of maximum maturity. A fertilization ratio of 500:1 sperm:oocyte was used. The incubation was carried out in 3-L containers with filtered seawater at 10.7 ± 0.9°C without aeration. Observations, measurements and the duration of each embryonic and larval stage were recorded. The oocyte has a prominent gelatinous layer (= jelly coat) that disappears between the gastrula and trochophore stages. The status of the D-larval stage was reached at 107 h post fertilization with a mean valve length of 91.4 ± 8.9 µm. This is the first record of the complete embryonic development of this baby clam until the early larval stage and the conditioning in a water circulation system for 48 days are suitable for the species.","Barría, C.; Abarca, A.; Colivoro, D.; Célis, A.; Couve, P.; Cárcamo, D.; Durán, L.R.; Oliva, D.",NULL,"Barría, Camila, C.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.15128,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Tawera elliptica, ""Veneridae""",NULL,NULL,"Gelatinous layer, juliana clam, laboratory conditioning, small scale aquaculture, Veneridae",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Although many of the larval forms have been categorized as trochophores or modified trochophores, there are a few groups with distinctive larval features that make them easy to distinguish from other annelid larvae. We collected 252 annelid larvae from the plankton, with particular emphasis on oweniids, polygordiids, and thalassematids (i.e., echiurans) and sequenced fragments of their <i>cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1</i> and 16S ribosomal RNA genes. We found six oweniid, five polygordiid, and eight thalassematid OTUs. Thalassematids were found only in samples from the Pacific, and oweniids were found only in Caribbean samples. Among the oweniids we found two distinct morphotypes, one with a narrow, cloche shape and another that had a wider and more rectangular shape with clearly developed lappets. Among the polygordiids, we identified one larva as <i>Polygordius eschaturus</i> and several larvae as <i>Polygordius jenniferae</i>. All larvae, except for the <i>P. eschaturus</i>, which was at a stage too early to make a determination, were endolarvae. Among the thalassematids, we identified larvae of <i>Ochetostoma edax</i> and found seven unidentified OTUs. Finally, 150 miscellaneous polychaete larvae were sequenced, representing ~76 OTUs. Four rostraria larvae from the Caribbean, whose sequences confirm the long-held assumption that they are amphinomids, could not be identified to species. In total only 5% of these OTUs could be identified to species with known sequences, and most could not be identified to genus or even family with reasonable certainty. It is clear that this poor coverage in the reference databases will limit metabarcoding efforts to document numbers of OTUs, and that DNA barcodes will be of limited use for identifying neotropical marine annelids until reference databases have improved their coverage of this group.","Collin, R.; Venera-Pontón, D.E.; Macdonald, K.S.; Driskell, A.C.; Boyle, M.J.",NULL,"Collin, Rachel, R.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.12311,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Echiura, ""Mitraria""",NULL,NULL,"biodiversity, DNA barcoding, echiura, mitraria, Panama, worms",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Natural communities were collected in three periods, i.e., autumn, spring and summer, to address the influence of the different environmental conditions. The responses of autotrophic plankton communities to experimentally induced N and/or P limitations were assessed as changes in chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl <i>a</i>) concentrations and in the abundances of potentially mixotrophic protists taxa. We observed blooms (> 10<sup>5</sup> cells l<sup>−1</sup>) of nanoflagellates in autumn, and of phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria in summer. Communities showed a co-limitation by N and P at the three sampling periods, despite high N:P ratios in autumn and spring. The high abundances of potentially mixotrophic dinoflagellates during these periods suggest the involvement of alternative trophic pathways for their maintenance in the lagoon. After bioassay incubations using different nutrient enrichment treatments, we often observed reduced abundances of mixotrophic protists containing Chl <i>a</i> with a concomitant increased abundance of protists without Chl <i>a</i>. This indicates a loss of chloroplasts and photoautotrophic abilities in protists cells, possibly reflecting a shift towards heterotrophy that could be sustained by phagotrophy.","Leruste, A.; Garrido, M.; Malet, N.; Bec, B.; De Wit, R.; Cecchi, P.; Pasqualini, V.",NULL,"Leruste, Amandine, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04517-w,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Growth rate, Dinoflagellates, Nutrient limitation, Mixotrophy",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Species of the gastropod family Ovulidae are closely associated with chemically defended soft corals and can accumulate food-derived defensive substances. A painted mantle covers the shell, camouflaging some ovulid mollusks and making other conspicuous, which makes these mollusks a good model object for studying correlations between types of protective coloration and taste deterrence. We compared the palatability of two ovulids: <i>Ovula ovum</i>, whose coloration most researchers have interpreted as aposematic (although never tested directly), and <i>Calpurnus verrucosus</i>, whose coloration cannot be confidently assigned as either aposematic or cryptic. In feeding experiments, agar pellets flavored with water extracts of two mollusks and six soft coral species were offered to sympatric fishes, the Indo-Pacific sergeant (<i>Abudefduf vaigiensis</i>) and the juvenile barramundi (<i>Lates calcarifer</i>). Additionally, we studied fish feeding behavior. We found that both the foot and mantle of <i>Ovula ovum</i> have a strong aversive taste for fish, which proves aposematism in this species. On the contrary, <i>Calpurnus verrucosus</i> had an attractive taste for fish, which excludes aposematism in this mollusk. We contemplate possible crypticity over a long distance and in low visibility, as well as unlikeness of mimetic nature of such coloration. All soft corals tested, including host species for mollusks (<i>Sarcophyton</i> and <i>Sinularia</i>) were strongly aversive. Because both mollusks feed on soft corals but differ dramatically in palatability, it is probable that <i>Ovula ovum</i> and <i>Calpurnus verrucosus</i> transform soft coral antifeedants in different ways; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of <i>de novo</i> synthesis of taste deterrents in <i>Ovula ovum</i>. Both fish species orosensorially tested flavored pellets several times before swallowing or rejecting them. For pellets that produce aversive taste, the number of repeated grasps is smaller and retention time is longer than for pellets that produce attractive taste.","Kasumyan, A.; Isaeva, O.; Zvonareva, S.",NULL,"Kasumyan, Alexander, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151529,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Ovulidae,NULL,NULL,"Predator–prey interactions, Chemical defense, Taste deterrence, Aposematism, Crypticity",Journal article,NULL,NULL

There was no significant difference between the survival of oysters cultured on biofouled and cleaned coconut shell and oyster shell cultches. Marketable size oysters (≥ 6 cm shell height) are attainable in 7 to 8 months for both treatments. It was concluded that biofouling had no deleterious effect on the growth and survival of oysters. Besides, given the preferred shucked oysters in the Ghanaian market, it is inessential to incur further cost to control biofoulers.","Osei, I.K.; Yankson, K.; Obodai, E.A.",NULL,"Osei, Isaac Kofi, I.K.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00659-9,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Crassostrea tulipa,NULL,NULL,"Oyster cultch, Fouling organisms, Growth rate, Physico-chemical factors, Survival, West African mangrove oyster",Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, information on their soft-bottom benthic communities, a key tool for managing programmes, is still scarce. We combined environment features with macro- and meiofaunal soft-bottom community information for assessing the ecological status of marinas with an integrative approach. To address this issue, we focused on eight marinas of the Southern Iberian Peninsula. Macro- and meiofauna data revealed high benthic heterogeneity at a spatial scale. The environmental variables which correlated best with macrofauna were mainly phosphorus, granulometry, and total organic carbon, and secondarily important variables were faecal coliforms, the biocide Irgarol, and heavy metals; total hydrocarbon concentration was also significant for meiofauna. Annelida was the dominant phylum in terms of number of species (37%) and abundance (66%) and were better descriptors of the environmental conditions than Arthropoda and Mollusca. Although identification to the species level is desirable and mandatory for assessing biological pollution, significant differences among marinas and correlations between fauna and abiotic variables were already detected at the level of family and order. This implies that biota assessment at higher levels may still be useful in monitoring programmes limited by time and budget constraints. The major novelty of this study lies in the development of an integrative assessment method based on the following selected ecological indicators: Marinas Environmental Pollution Index (MEPI), Biocontamination Index (BCI), macrofaunal biotic indices (AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, MEDOCC and BENFES), macrofaunal taxa richness and Shannon-Wiener's diversity, and nematode:copepod index. This approach was able to discriminate marinas of the Southern Iberian Peninsula based on their ecological status, which ranged from poor to good. The method can be useful to design standards for assigning “sustainable quality seals” to those marinas with better values of ecological indicators.","Guerra-García, J.M.; Navarro-Barranco, C.; Ros, M.; Sedano, F.; Espinar, R.; Fernández-Romero, A.; Martinez-Laiz, G.; Cuesta, J.A.; Giráldez, I.; Morales, E.; Florido, M.; Moreira, J.",NULL,"Moreira, Juan, J.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112237,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Marinas, Ecological assessment, Macrofauna, Meiofauna, Soft bottoms, Taxonomic resolution",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Concentrations of Cd in <i>B. vexillum</i> from Visayan Sea mostly exceeded the 1.0 mg/kg maximum allowable limit based on Philippines and EU regulations. Nearly 95% of <i>B. vexillum</i> samples collected from the control area in adjacent Camotes Sea passed the regulatory limit. Higher concentrations of cadmium were recorded in dry season. Preliminary risk assessment obtained in this study showed that the percentage of the population that might contract cancer is 0.01–0.6% for exposed children, 0.08–4% for teens, and 0.2–1% for adults. No significant correlation was obtained between the cadmium content of <i>B. vexillum</i>, water, and sediments.

Over the years, Mar Menor has suffered a significant environmental degradation due to multiple factors with anthropogenic origin. The transformation from a rain-fed basin to intensive irrigated agriculture has led to an rise in the water inflow and nutrients in the basin, which has provoked severe eutrophication. The increase in nutrients led to changes in the structure and function of the lagoon ecosystems. The epibenthic and suspension feeder organisms have benefited from this imbalance, proliferating and reaching a high population density. The composition and abundance of the species assemblage found in the sub-coastal bottoms of the coastal lagoon after the environmental crisis occurred in 2016, using artificial settlement structures. The variation in community density and affinity between sampling sites in 2017 and 2018, were determined. A total of 31 species belonging to 27 genera and 7 phyla were observed in 11 samples. The best represented class are polychaeta (Phylum Annelida) with 11 identified species. The genus with the greatest species richness was <i>Hydroides</i> with two species: <i>H. dianthus</i> (Verrill, 1873), and <i>H. elegans</i> (Haswell, 1883), both of them considered potentially invasive and opportunistic species followed by the genus <i>Serpula</i>, with two species: <i>S. vermicularis</i> (Linnaeus, 1767), and <i>S. concharum</i> (Langerhans, 1880) and the genus <i>Branchiomma</i> was represented with another exotic invasive species, <i>B. boholense</i> (Grube, 1878), which is only found in collectors in 2018.

This study examined coral communities at three intertidal habitats, i.e., reef flats, sloping seawalls, and vertical seawalls, in Singapore, looking at species diversity, abundances, growth forms, and colony sizes. A total of 35 coral species were recorded, of which the majority (51%) were typically of massive growth form. Reef flats had the highest number of species (30), followed by sloping seawalls (21). Species on vertical seawalls (11) were a subset of the two other habitats. Colonies were dominantly massive (72%) and sparsely distributed with average colony densities between 0.05 and 0.4 colonies/m2. Species <i>Porites lobata-lutea</i> complex was widespread and most abundant, comprising 21–30% of colonies in each habitat. Six other species common across all habitats were <i>Dipsastraea speciose</i>, <i>Favites abdita</i>, <i>Goniastrea retiformis</i>, <i>Platygyra verweyi</i>, <i>Platygyra pini</i>, and <i>Platygyra sinensis</i>.

Relative abundances on the reef flats correlated moderately with those on the sloping seawalls (Pearson’s <i>ρ</i> = 0.6) and vertical seawalls (Pearson’s <i>ρ</i> = 0.7), respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that habitat origin (natural vs man-made) and surface rugosity (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous) were factors that significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) differentiated intertidal coral communities. Nevertheless, sloping seawall communities bore higher resemblance to those on natural reef flats than to man-made vertical seawalls in species and growth form richness and also coral densities. These findings highlight interesting opportunities for incorporating coral-friendly designs into existing man-made sloping coastal structures to encourage the growth of coral communities in the intertidal zone.","Lee, Y.; Lam, S.Q.Y.; Tay, T.S.; Kikuzawa, Y.P.; Tan, K.S.",NULL,"Tan, Koh Siang, K.S.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-021-02059-0,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Substratum comparisons, Reef flat, Sloping and vertical seawalls, Singapore, Porites, Massive growth forms ",Journal article,NULL,NULL

No study, to our knowledge, has documented the molecular scale effect of plastics on foraminifera.Our analyses revealed three possible ways through which plastic-related molecules and plastic debris can enter a biogeochemical cycle and may affect the ecosystems: 1) foraminifera <i>in situ</i> can grow on plastic remains, namely <i>C. lobatulus</i>, <i>R. bradyi</i> and <i>T. bocki</i>, showing signals of oxidative stress and protein aggregation in comparison with R. globularis cultured in negative control; 2) DEHP can be incorporated in the cytoplasm of calcareous foraminifera, as observed in <i>R. globularis</i>; 3) microplastic debris, identified as epoxy resin, can be found in the cytoplasm and the agglutinated shell of <i>T. bocki</i>.We hypothesize that plastic waste and their associated additives may produce modifications related to the biomineralization process in foraminifera.

Limited alien share and an apparent saturation of aliens (similar proportion in ports of very different size) suggests the occurrence of “alien drift” in port communities, or random retention of newly introduced aliens that reminds genetic drift of new mutations in a population.","Ardura, A.; Fernandez, S.; Haguenauer, A.; Planes, S.; Garcia-Vazquez, E.",NULL,"Fernandez, Sara, S.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112251,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Alien drift, Barcoding, Biological changes, Boats, Ecosystem, French Polynesia, NGS, NIS",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Use additive manufacturing and silicone moulds for converting three-dimensional samples into limestone mortar with white Portland cement substrates for coral growth.    Design/methodology/approach  Tiles samples were designed and printed with different geometries and textures inspired by nature marine environment. Commercial coral frag tiles were analysed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify the main chemical elements. Raw materials and coral species were selected. New base substrates were manufactured and deployed into a closed-circuit aquarium to monitor the coral weekly evolution process and analyse the results obtained.    Findings  Experimental results provided positive statistical parameters for future implementation tests, concluding that the intensity of textured surface, interfered favourably in the coralline algae biofilm growth. The chemical composition and design of the substrates were determinant factors for successful coral propagation. Recesses and cavities mimic the natural rocks aspect and promoted the presence and interaction of other species that favour the richness of the ecosystem.    Originality/value  Additive manufacturing provided an innovative method of production for ecology restoration areas, allowing rapid prototyping of substrates with high complexity morphologies, a critical and fundamental attribute to guarantee coral growth and Crustose Coralline Algae. The result of this study showed the feasibility of this approach using three-dimensional printing technologies.","Matus, I.V.; Lino Alves, J.; Góis, J.; Barata da Rocha, A.; Neto, R.; Da Silva Mota, C.",NULL,"Barata da Rocha, Augusto, A.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rpj-07-2020-0165,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Design; Additive manufacturing; Artificial reef; Coral propagation; Limestone substrates; Portland cement mortar,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, doubt exists over the validity of these diagnoses as there are no reports of <i>Gnathostoma</i> spp. in Australian teleost fish. Also, the diagnoses in human cases were based on a serological test developed in Thailand. The specificity and sensitivity of this test in non-endemic areas are uncertain. Interestingly, parasites belonging to the genus <i>Echinocephalus</i>, which morphologically are very similar to <i>Gnathostomum</i>, are commonly found in Australian fish and shellfish and can potentially infect humans. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of these zoonotic nematodes within commercial fish and to characterise nematode larvae in order to provide insights into the specific identity of the potential causative agents of gnathostomiasis in Australia. Six edible fish species (n = 163) were examined. Gnathostomid-type larvae were found only in <i>Acanthopagrus australis</i> and <i>Rhabdosargus sarba</i>. Detailed examination and sequence data suggested parasite larvae belonged to the genus <i>Echinocephalus</i>. Further investigation of the occurrence of zoonotic nematodes within marine environments and observation of their spatial and temporal patterns will help raise awareness of the significance of this food safety issue within global fishing industries and health sectors. The accurate identification of zoonotic nematodes is a key component of disease surveillance and control. This information can also be used to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic test.","Shamsi, S.; Steller, E.; Zhu, X.",NULL,"Steller, Eleanor, E.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2021.102333,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Echinocephalus,NULL,NULL,"Seafood safety, Parasites, Public health, Diagnosis, Misdiagnosis",Journal article,NULL,NULL

As an exotic mangrove species, it is important to understand the influence of <i>Sonneratia</i> plantations on marine nematode assemblages. We studied the Zhanjiang and Xiatanwei mangrove wetlands on the South China Coast during the four seasons of 2010 and 2019. The results showed that <i>S. apetala</i> plantations increased the number of genera, Shannon-Wiener diversity, richness, evenness, maturity index (MI) and decreased the index of trophic diversity (ITD) values for nematodes compared to those in mudflats, but did not change significantly compared to those of native mangrove forests. In addition, <i>Sonneratia</i> plantations did not significantly change nematode assemblages compared to those of native mangroves, though they did change significantly compared to those in mudflats. Thus, interplanting <i>S. apetala</i> into native mangrove forests may be an effective substitute for using native mangroves in mangrove plantation.","Fu, S.; Rao, Y.; Chen, X.; Zhou, X.; Wu, C.; Li, X.; Peng, W.; Cai, L.",NULL,"Li, Xiang, X.",NULL,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112249,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Sonneratia apetala,NULL,NULL,"Mangroves, Introduced species, Sonneratia apetala, Marine nematodes, South China Coast",Journal article,NULL,NULL

A comprehensive survey was performed by R.V. Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, starting from June 24 to July 16, 2018. Variations of fish density and diversity on the continental shelf of Sri Lanka were determined by region (East and West) and depth (20–50 m and 50–100 m) using 65 trawl samples collected. Associations between ichthyofauna, ecological parameters, and hydrographic variables (temperature, salinity, and oxygen) were determined. There were 620 species from 137 different families observed during the survey, with family Myctophidae being the most dominant with the highest number of individuals caught from all station (24.61% out of the total number of individuals) while the most represented families by density (t/NM2) were Carangidae (8.01%). A total of 440 species were found in the East region compared to 385 species in the West region; the density of fish was 1.3 times higher in the East region (9.00 ± 1.08 t/NM2) compared to the West region (6.85 ± 1.40 t/NM2). Similarly, the East region was 1.3 higher in the Shannon Wiener’s Diversity Index (SWDI) than the West region. Shallow-water (20–50 m) area has been reported as more diverse and denser than deep-water (50–100 m). Canonical correlation analysis showed a positive association of fish density with oxygen and a negative with temperature and salinity. This study would be an invaluable baseline for monitoring future changes and preparing recommendations and management action plans.","Athukoorala, A.A.S.H.; Bhujel, R.C.; Krakstad, J.-O.; Matsuishi, T.F.",NULL,"Athukoorala, A.
