These investigations occur at many phylogenetic, temporal and spatial scales and within a variety of biological and geological disciplines but often in relative isolation. This issue focuses on what can be achieved when ecological mechanisms are integrated into analyses of deep-time biodiversity patterns through the union of fossil and extant data and methods. We expand upon this perspective to argue that, given its direct relevance to the current biodiversity crisis, greater integration is needed across biodiversity research. We focus on the need to understand scaling effects, how lower-level ecological and evolutionary processes scale up and vice versa, and the importance of incorporating functional biology. Placing function at the core of biodiversity research is fundamental, as it establishes how an organism interacts with its abiotic and biotic environment and it is functional diversity that ultimately determines important ecosystem processes. To achieve full integration, concerted and ongoing efforts are needed to build a united and interactive community of biodiversity researchers, with education and interdisciplinary training at its heart.","Price, S.A.; Schmitz, L.",WOS:000374436100011,"Price, S.A.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rstb.2015.0228,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,Biodiversity,NULL,Functional biology; Scale-dependency; Ecomorphology; Macroevolution,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To project the response of benthic species of a shelf sea (North Sea) to the expected climate change, the distributions of 75 marine benthic species were modelled and the spatial changes in distribution were projected for 2099 based on modelled bottom temperature and salinity changes using the IPCC scenario A1B. Mean bottom temperature was projected to increase between 0.15 and 5.4 °C, while mean bottom salinity was projected to moderately increase by 1.7. The spatial changes in species distribution were modelled with Maxent and the direction and extent of these changes were assessed. The results showed a latitudinal northward shift for 64% of the species (maximum 109 km; brittle star <em>Ophiothrix fragilis</em>) and a southward shift for 36% (maximum 101 km; hermit crab <em>Pagurus prideaux</em> and the associated cloak anemone <em>Adamsia carciniopados</em>; 105 km). The relatively low rates of distributional shifts compared to fish or plankton species were probably influenced by the regional topography. The environmental gradients in the central North Sea along the 50 m depth contour might act as a ‘barrier’, possibly resulting in a compression of distribution range and hampering further shifts to the north. For 49 species this resulted in a habitat loss up to 100%, while only 11 species could benefit from the warming in terms of habitat gain. Particularly the benthic communities of the southern North Sea, where the strongest temperature increase was projected, would be strongly affected by the distributional changes, since key species showed northward shifts and high rates of habitat loss, with potential ramifications for the functioning of the ecosystem.","Weinert, M.; Mathis, M.; Kröncke, I.; Neumann, H.; Pohlmann, T.; Reiss, H.",WOS:000377311100016,"Neumann, Hermann, H.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.024,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,Macrofauna,Biogeographical shifts; Maximum entropy (Maxen); Climate change scenarios; Macrofauna; Species distribution models; Projections ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Considering predictions from alternative models, with a range of assumptions and data requirements, therefore provides a more robust approach.    The intractability and uncertainty resulting from a suite of predictions may hinder the application of science in policy, where a single prediction with little ambiguity or uncertainty would be most desirable. Few studies modelling species' distributions attempt to present multi-model outputs in a format most useful to the non-modelling community, and none of these have done so for the marine environment.    The problem of uncertainty is particularly prevalent in predicting the distribution of invasive alien species under climate change. As invasive alien species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and may incur significant economic costs, the benefit of applying predictions to highlight areas of possible establishment and inform policy and management may be large.    An ensemble prediction is used to assess the distribution of suitable habitat for the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, in UK waters both currently and in the future. The ensemble incorporates predictions from three species distribution models, using data from two global climate models. A method is developed highlighting the agreement of the ensemble, further applying threshold values to retain information from constituent predictions in the final map of agreement.    Ensemble predictions made here suggest that Pacific oyster will experience an opening of suitable habitat in northern UK waters, reaching the Faroe Islands and the eastern Norwegian Sea by 2050. Habitat suitability will increase with warming temperatures in the English Channel and Central North Sea for this species. The approaches applied here can be incorporated into risk assessment frameworks for invasive species, as stipulated in the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Jones, M.C.; Dye, S.R.; Pinnegar, J.K.; Warren, R.; Cheung, W.W.L.",WOS:000325228300007,"Jones, Miranda, M.C.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/aqc.2364,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    ocean;distribution;habitat mapping;invertebrates;alien species;climate change,Journal article,NULL,NULL

A possibility for the lack of a relationship between PLD and range size may stem from the failure of past studies to account for the effect of species evolutionary ages, which may add to the dispersal capabilities of species. However, if dispersal over ecological (i.e. PLD) and across evolutionary (i.e. species evolutionary age) time scales continues to show no effect on range size then an outstanding question is why? Here we collected data on PLD, evolutionary ages and range sizes of seven tropical fish families (five families were reef-associated and two have dwell demersal habitats) to explore the independent and interactive effects of PLD and evolutionary age on range size. Separate analyses on each family showed that even after controlling for evolutionary age, PLD has an insignificant or a very small effect on range size. To shed light on why dispersal has such a limited effect on range size, we developed a global ocean circulation model to quantify the connectivity among tropical reefs relative to the potential dispersal conferred by PLD. We found that although there are several areas of great isolation in the tropical oceans, most reef habitats are within the reach of most species given their PLDs. These results suggest that the lack of habitat isolation can potentially render the constraining effect of dispersal on range size insignificant and explain why dispersal does not relate to range size in reef fishes.","Mora, C.; Treml, E.A.; Roberts, J.; Crosby, K.; Roy, D.; Tittensor, D.P.",WOS:000298915300011,"Mora, Camilo, C.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06874.x,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We have collected global microscopy data of the genus <i>Phaeocystis</i> and converted abundance data to carbon biomass using species-specific carbon conversion factors. Microscopic counts of single-celled and colonial <i>Phaeocystis</i> were obtained both through the mining of online databases and by accepting direct submissions (both published and unpublished) from <i>Phaeocystis</i> specialists. We recorded abundance data from a total of 1595 depth-resolved stations sampled between 1955–2009. The quality-controlled dataset includes 5057 counts of individual <i>Phaeocystis</i> cells resolved to species level and information regarding life-stages from 3526 samples. 83% of stations were located in the Northern Hemisphere while 17% were located in the Southern Hemisphere. Most data were located in the latitude range of 50–70° N. While the seasonal distribution of Northern Hemisphere data was well-balanced, Southern Hemisphere data was biased towards summer months. Mean species- and form-specific cell diameters were determined from previously published studies. Cell diameters were used to calculate the cellular biovolume of <i>Phaeocystis</i> cells, assuming spherical geometry. Cell biomass was calculated using a carbon conversion factor for prymnesiophytes. For colonies, the number of cells per colony was derived from the colony volume. Cell numbers were then converted to carbon concentrations. An estimation of colonial mucus carbon was included a posteriori, assuming a mean colony size for each species. Carbon content per cell ranged from 9 pg C cell<sup>-1</sup> (single-celled <i>Phaeocystis antarctica</i>) to 29 pg C cell<sup>-1</sup> (colonial <i>Phaeocystis globosa</i>). Non-zero <i>Phaeocystis</i> cell biomasses (without mucus carbon) range from 2.9 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 5.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> µg C l<sup>-1</sup>, with a mean of 45.7 µg C l<sup>-1</sup> and a median of 3.0 µg C l<sup>-1</sup>.

Faster glacier retreat and related calving events lead to more frequent iceberg scouring, fresh water input and higher sediment loads, which in turn affect shallow water benthic marine assemblages in coastal regions. In addition, ice retreat creates new benthic substrates for colonization. We investigated three size classes of benthic biota (microbenthos, meiofauna and macrofauna) at three sites in Potter Cove (King George Island, West Antarctic Peninsula) situated at similar water depths but experiencing different disturbance regimes related to glacier retreat. Our results revealed the presence of a patchy distribution of highly divergent benthic assemblages within a relatively small area (about 1 km<sup>2</sup>). In areas with frequent ice scouring and higher sediment accumulation rates, an assemblage mainly dominated by macrobenthic scavengers (such as the polychaete <i>Barrukia cristata</i>), vagile organisms and younger individuals of sessile species (such as the bivalve <i>Yoldia eightsi</i>) was found. Macrofauna were low in abundance and very patchily distributed in recently ice-free areas close to the glacier, whereas the pioneer nematode genus <i>Microlaimus</i> reached a higher relative abundance in these newly exposed sites. The most diverse and abundant macrofaunal assemblage was found in areas most remote from recent glacier influence. By contrast, the meiofauna showed relatively low densities in these areas. The three benthic size classes appeared to respond in different ways to disturbances likely related to ice retreat, suggesting that the capacity to adapt and colonize habitats is dependent on both body size and specific life traits. We predict that, under continued deglaciation, more diverse, but less patchy, benthic assemblages will become established in areas out of reach of glacier-related disturbance.","Pasotti, F.; Manini, E.; Giovannelli, D.; Wölfl, A.-C.; Monien, D.; Verleyen, E.; Braeckman, U.; Abele, D.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000358729600036,"Manini, Elena, E.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/maec.12179,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Meiofauna, ""Microbenthos""",NULL,Benthic ecology; Climate change-related responses; Macrofauna; West Antarctic Peninsula,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Recent biochemical profiling revealed anti-plasmodial activity of brominated compounds in Lamellodysidea of the Pacific. Here, we present a comparative chemotaxonomic and molecular analysis of selected Dysideidae from the Pacific and the Indian Ocean (New Caledonia, Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, Mayotte, Guam, Palau). We investigated the phylogenetic relationships between the populations and assessed their bioactive (PBDE) compounds in order to unravel the taxonomic status of this commercially important group of sponges and assessed patterns of dispersal and biochemical variation. The molecular phylogeny was based on the internal transcribed ribosomal spacer and compared against a PBDE phylogeny for several specimens. Molecular data revealed a diversity of Indo-Pacific L. herbacea populations, also reflected by different PBDE compound profiles. Molecular and biochemical data also revealed a Lamellodysidea species new to science. Several specimens misidentified as Lamellodysidea were detected based on their position on different clades in the molecular phylogeny and their production of different halogenated compounds (brominated vs. chlorinated).

By gathering new mitochondrial sequences that were merged with published datasets, we analysed genetic patterns in different regions, with a focus on 1) their sympatric range and 2) allopatric populations in N and S America and southern Europe. In the sympatric range, the two species display contrasting genetic diversity patterns, with low polymorphism in C. robusta supporting the prevalent view of its recent introduction. In the E Pacific, several genetic traits support the non-native status of C. robusta. However, in the NE Pacific, this appraisal requires a complex scenario of introduction and should be further examined supported by extensive sampling efforts in the NW Pacific (putative native range). For C. intestinalis, Bayesian analysis suggested a natural amphi-North Atlantic distribution, casting doubt on its non-native status in the NW Atlantic.

In this way, fibres avoid extinction. These intra-fibre organicrich bands appear on the growth surface of the shell as minuscule elevations, which have to be secreted differentially by the outer mantle cells. We propose that, as the shell thickens during mineralization, fibre secretion proceeds by a mechanism of contact recognition and displacement of the tips along circular trajectories by the cells of the outer mantle surface. Given the sizes of the tips, this mechanism has to operate at the subcellular level. Accordingly, the fabrication of the helical microstructure is under strict biological control.

The origin and contemporary composition of reef-associated taxa in this region can illuminate biogeographical principles about vicariance and the establishment (or local extirpation) of existing species. Here we aim to: (1) outline the distribution of shallow water fauna between the Red Sea and adjacent regions, (2) explore mechanisms for maintaining these distributions and (3) propose hypotheses to test these mechanisms. LocationRed Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean. MethodsUpdated checklists for scleractinian corals, fishes and non-coral invertebrates were used to determine species richness in the Red Sea and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula and assess levels of endemism. Fine-scale diversity and abundance of reef fishes within the Red Sea were explored using ecological survey data. ResultsWithin the Red Sea, we recorded 346 zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate scleractinian coral species of which 19 are endemic (5.5%). Currently 635 species of polychaetes, 211 echinoderms and 79 ascidians have been documented, with endemism rates of 12.6%, 8.1% and 16.5% respectively. A preliminary compilation of 231 species of crustaceans and 137 species of molluscs include 10.0% and 6.6% endemism respectively. We documented 1071 shallow fish species, with 12.9% endemic in the entire Red Sea and 14.1% endemic in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Based on ecological survey data of endemic fishes, there were no major changes in species richness or abundance across 1100km of Saudi Arabian coastline. Main conclusionsThe Red Sea biota appears resilient to major environmental fluctuations and is characterized by high rates of endemism with variable degrees of incursion into the Gulf of Aden. The nearby Omani and Arabian Gulfs also have variable environments and high levels of endemism, but these are not consistently distinct across taxa.

This study describes the benthic biodiversity of a rocky reef and its surrounding sand bottom with dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds in the Borkum Reef Grounds, north of the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Dutch North Sea. A side-scan sonar survey revealed distinct seabed areas with high acoustic reflections, indicating the presence of hard substrate on the sandy seafloor. To ground truth the side-scan sonar data and make an inventory of the biodiversity of the observed habitats, a multi-method sampling approach (box corer, SCUBA airlift sampler and visual transects, drop-down camera) was used. This revealed (1) rocky reefs: a combination of gravel, stones and rocks; (2) individual rocks in a sandy environment; (3) sand with dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds (> 1500 ind·m<sup>-2</sup>) and (4) sand bottom habitat. A total of 193 taxa were found with many unique species per habitat. Species richness was significantly higher on sand when compared to the rocky reef (NB-GLM; p = 0.006), caused by the presence of dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds (Poisson GLM; p < 0.001). Including dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds as an additional habitat showed that these held a higher species richness than the rocky reefs (NB-GLM; p = 0.002), while sand without dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds did not (NB-GLM; p = 0.14). Since the rocky reefs were present on a sandy bottom, the local biodiversity more than doubled with the presence of rocky reefs. The nMDS plot clearly separated the sand and rocky reef communities and also showed a clustering of dense <i>L. conchilega</i> beds within the sand samples. Each method detected unique species, demonstrating the value of a multi-method approach compared to e.g. box coring alone. This study identified several species previously unknown to the Borkum Reefs Grounds area. The total area of rocky reefs in the southern part of the Dutch Borkum Reef area is estimated to be 9.8 km<sup>2</sup> and of <i>L. conchilega</i> beds with densities > 1500 ind·m<sup>- 2</sup> to be 74 km<sup>2</sup>. Further research should focus on the possible function of <i>L. conchilega</i> as an ecosystem engineer creating intermediate sand-reef systems. For mapping these <i>L. conchilega</i> beds, we advise using side-scan sonar imaging combined with ground truthing by drop-down cameras.","Coolen, J.; Bos, O.; Glorius, S.; Lengkeek, W.; Cuperus, J.; van der Weide, B.; Agüera, A.",WOS:000361160600009,"Agüera, Antonio, A.","Laboratoire de Biologie Marine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.010,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Lanice conchilega,NULL,NULL,Rocky reefs; Benthic fauna; Epifauna; Lanice conchilega; North Sea;Biodiversity; Habitat type 1170,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Utility of classical alpha-taxonomy for biodiversity of aquatic nematodes. <i>J. Nematol. 47(1)</i>: 1-10","Classical a-taxonomy'' has different interpretations. Therefore, within the framework of an integrated taxonomic approach it is not relevant to divide taxonomy in different components, each being allocated a different weight of importance. Preferably, taxonomy should be seen in a holistic way, including the act of delimiting and describing taxa, based on different features and available methods, and taxonomy can not be interpreted without looking at evolutionary relationships. The concept of diversity itself is quite diverse as is the measure of diversity. Taxonomic descriptions of free-living aquatic nematodes are very valuable as they provide basic phenotypic information that is necessary for the functional ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary interpretation of data gathered from molecular analyses and of the organism as a whole. In general, molecular taxonomic analyses have the advantage of being much faster and of being able to deal with a larger number of specimens but also possess the important advantage of dealing with a huge amount of features compared to the morphology-based approach. However, just as morphological studies, molecular analyses deal only with partial of an organism.	Decraemer, W.; Backeljau, T.	WOS:000353628000001	Backeljau, Thierry, T.

This review highlights Ulva as an exciting novel model organism for studies of algal growth, development and morphogenesis as well as mutualistic interactions. The key reasons that Ulva is potentially such a good model system are: (i) patterns of Ulva development can drive ecologically important events, such as the increasing number of green tides observed worldwide as a result of eutrophication of coastal waters, (ii) Ulva growth is symbiotic, with proper development requiring close association with bacterial epiphytes, (iii) Ulva is extremely developmentally plastic, which can shed light on the transition from simple to complex multicellularity and (iv) Ulva will provide additional information about the evolution of the green lineage.","Wichard, T.; Charrier, B.; Mineur, F.; Bothwell, J.; De Clerck, O.; Coates, J.",WOS:000349645600001,"Wichard, T.","Univ Jena, Inst Inorgan & Analyt Chem, Jena Sch Microbial Commun, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00072,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,Chlorophyta,NULL,NULL,algal genetics; chlorophyta; green tides; holobiont; multicellularorganism; model organism,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The Museum National dHistoire Naturelle in Paris is one of the leading laboratories in the Marine Barcode of Life (MarBOL) project, which was used as a pilot programme to include barcode collections for marine molluscs and crustaceans. The system is based on two relational databases. The first one classically records the data (locality and identification) attached to the specimens. In the second one, tissue-clippings, DNA extractions (both preserved in 2D barcode tubes) and PCR data (including primers) are linked to the corresponding specimen. All the steps of the process [sampling event, specimen identification, molecular processing, data submission to Barcode Of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank] are thus linked together. Furthermore, we have developed several web-based tools to automatically upload data into the system, control the quality of the sequences produced and facilitate the submission to online databases. This work is the result of a joint effort from several teams in the Museum National dHistoire Naturelle (MNHN), but also from a collaborative network of taxonomists and molecular systematists outside the museum, resulting in the vouchering so far of 41 000 sequences and the production of 11 000 COI sequences.","Puillandre, N.; Bouchet, P.; Boisselier-Dubayle, M.; Brisset, J.; Buge, B.; Castelin, M.; Chagnoux, S.; Christophe, T.; Corbari, L.; Lambourdiere, J.; Lozouet, P.; Marani, G.; Rivasseau, A.; Silva, N.; Terryn, Y.; Tillier, S.; Utge, J.; Samadi, S.",WOS:000302552900003,"Terryn, Yves, Y.",NaturalArt,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.03105.x,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Marine Barcode of Life; molecular database; museum collection; voucherspecimen,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Differences in status and trends according to geographical areas, species identity and small-scale variations within the same habitat where shown by assembling and mapping kelp distribution and trend data. Significant data gaps for some geographical regions, like the Mediterranean and the southern Iberian Peninsula, were also identified. The data used for this study confirmed a general trend with decreasing abundance of some native kelp species at their southern distributional range limits and increasing abundance in other parts of their distribution (<i>Saccharina latissima</i> and <i>Saccorhiza polyschides</i>). The expansion of the introduced species <i>Undaria pinnatifida</i> was also registered. Drivers of observed changes in kelp forests distribution and abundance were assessed using experts’ opinions. Multiple possible drivers were identified, including global warming, sea urchin grazing, harvesting, pollution and fishing pressure, and their impact varied between geographical areas.

Increasing anthropogenic emissions of nutrients and organic matter contribute to the depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO). Biotic sensitivity to low levels of DO is determined by the organisms’ ability to use DO as a respiratory gas, a process depending on oxygen partial pressure. A method is proposed to estimate an indicator of the intensity of the effects caused by hypoxia on exposed marine species. Sensitivity thresholds to hypoxia of an exposed ecological community, modelled as lowest-observed-effect-concentrations (LOEC), were compiled from literature for 91 demersal species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, annelids, and cnidarians, and converted to temperature-specific benthic (100 m depth) LOEC values. Species distribution and LOEC values were combined using a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) methodology to estimate the DO concentration at which the potentially affected fraction (PAF) of the community’s species having their LOEC exceeded is 50% (HC50<sub>LOEC</sub>). For the purpose of effect modelling in Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), effect factors (EF, [(PAF) m<sup>3</sup> kgO<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>]) were derived for five climate zones (CZ) to represent the change in effect due to a variation of the stressor intensity, or EF = dPAF/dDO = 0.5/HC50<sub>LOEC</sub>. Results range from 218 (PAF) m<sup>3</sup> kgO<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>  (polar CZ) to 306 (PAF) m<sup>3</sup> kgO<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup> (tropical CZ). Variation between CZs was modest so a site-generic global EF of 264 (PAF) m<sup>3</sup> kgO<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup> was also estimated and may be used to represent the average impact on a global ecological community of marine species exposed to hypoxia. The EF indicator is not significantly affected by the major sources of uncertainty in the underlying data suggesting valid applicability in characterisation modelling of marine eutrophication in LCIA.","Cosme, N.; Hauschild, M.Z.",WOS:000388785100046,"Cosme, Nuno, N.","Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Div Quantitat Sustainabil Assessment, Prod Torvet 424, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.006,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Dissolved oxygen depletion; Benthic habitat; Climate zone; Species sensitivity distribution; Potentially affected fraction; Life cycle impact assessment  ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

According to neutral theories of molecular evolution and biodiversity, dispersal limitation of propagules and population stochasticity are integral to shaping both genetic and community structure. We conducted a parallel analysis of biological connectivity at genetic and community levels in marine groups with different dispersal traits. We compiled large data sets of population genetic structure (98 benthic macroinvertebrate and 35 planktonic species) and biogeographic data (2193 benthic macroinvertebrate and 734 planktonic species). We estimated dispersal distances from population genetic data (i.e., FST vs. geographic distance) and from ß-diversity at the community level. Dispersal distances ranked the biological groups in the same order at both genetic and community levels, as predicted by organism dispersal ability and seascape connectivity: macrozoobenthic species without dispersing larvae, followed by macrozoobenthic species with dispersing larvae and plankton (phyto- and zooplankton). This ranking order is associated with constraints to the movement of macrozoobenthos within the seabed compared with the pelagic habitat. We showed that dispersal limitation similarly determines the connectivity degree of communities and populations, supporting the predictions of neutral theories in marine biodiversity patterns.","Chust, G.; Villarino, E.; Chenuil, A.; Irigoien, X.; Bizsel, N.; Bode, A.; Broms, C.; Claus, S.; Fernández de Puelles, M.L.; Fonda Umani, S.; Hoarau, G.; Mazzocchi, M.G.; Mozetic, P.; Vandepitte, L.; Veríssimo, H.; Zervoudaki, S.; Borja, A.",WOS:000378516200001,"Irigoien, Xabier, X.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep28730,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This Perspective presents a vision for global observation and monitoring of biological invasions. We show how the architecture for tracking biological invasions is provided by a minimum information set of Essential Variables, global collaboration on data sharing and infrastructure, and strategic contributions by countries. We show how this novel, synthetic approach to an observation system for alien species provides a tangible and attainable solution to delivering the information needed to slow the rate of new incursions and reduce the impacts of invaders. We identify three Essential Variables for Invasion Monitoring; alien species occurrence, species alien status and alien species impact. We outline how delivery of this minimum information set by joint, complementary contributions from countries and global community initiatives is possible. Country contributions are made feasible using a modular approach where all countries are able to participate and strategically build their contributions to a global information set over time. The vision we outline will deliver wide-ranging benefits to countries and international efforts to slow the rate of biological invasions and minimize their environmental impacts.

However, host specificity varies significantly depending on host phylogeny, body size, habitat, and geographic distribution. The best studied hosts tend to be vertebrates, larger animals, and/or widespread, and thus have a higher number of parasites and host-specific parasites. Thus, host specificity for these well-known taxa cannot be simply extrapolated to other taxa, notably invertebrates, small sized, and more endemic species, which comprise the major portion of yet to be discovered species. At present, parasites of animals comprise about 5% of named species. This article analyzed the rate of description of several largely parasitic taxa within crustaceans (copepods, amphipods, isopods, pentastomids, cirripeds), marine helminths (nematodes, acanthocephalans, flukes), gastropod molluscs, insects (ticks, fleas, biting flies, strepispterans), and microsporidia. The period of highest discovery has been most recent for the marine helminths and microsporids. The number of people describing parasites has been increasing since the 1960s, as it has for all other taxa. However, the number of species being described per decade relative to the number of authors has been decreasing except for the helminths. The results indicate that more than half of all parasites have been described, and two-thirds of host taxa, although the proportion varies between taxa. It is highly unlikely that the number of named species of parasites will ever approach that of their hosts. This contrast between the proportion that parasites comprise of local and global faunas suggests that parasites are less host specific and more widespread than local scale studies suggest.","Costello, M.J.",WOS:000384303700010,"Costello, Mark John, M.J.","Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icb/icw084,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Treatment of envenomation involves the prevention of further nematocyst release and relieving local and systemic symptoms. Many anecdotal treatments are available but species-specific first aid response is essential for effective treatment. However, species identification is difficult in most cases. There is evidence that oral analgesics, seawater, baking soda slurry and 42–45 °C hot water are effective against nematocyst inhibition and giving pain relief. The application of topical vinegar for 30 s is effective on stings of specific species. Treatments, which produce osmotic or pressure changes can exacerbate the initial sting and aggravate symptoms, common among many anecdotal treatments. Most available therapies are based on weak evidence and thus it is strongly recommended that randomized clinical trials are undertaken. We recommend a vital increase in directed research on the effect of environmental factors on envenoming mechanisms and to establish a species-specific treatment. Adequate signage on jellyfish stings and standardized first aid protocols with emphasis on protective equipment and avoidance of jellyfish to minimize cases should be implemented in areas at risk.

Most estimates are unverifiable, not being based on reproducible methods. Ultimately the best way to gauge diversity is explicit enumeration: actual listing of known species. Comprehensive lists of species are valued as a basis for systematic revisions and for comparing diversity across taxa, but it is less appreciated that they also provide a means for statistical sampling of biodiversity databases. I assessed the completeness of molluscan species listings in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) by comparing it to a standardized inventory of the species represented in the Malacology collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP). Random samples of names were scored for presence or absence in WoRMS, with standard errors calculated from the binomial distribution. The WoRMS database has about 1,200 duplicate or extraneous listings for mollusk species and is missing about 1,300 (3%). Overall marine molluscan diversity is estimated at 43,600 ± 900 species, where 900 is a 95% confidence interval. The validity of this confidence interval depends on the WoRMS database and the ANSP collection not having correlated weaknesses. Lack of relatively complete species databases prevents similar assessments for terrestrial and freshwater mollusks, but, using less rigorous methods, I estimate that there are 70,000 to 76,000 described species of recent Mollusca.</p> <p class=""last"">The low end of this estimate, 70,000 species, is similar to the number of recent chordate species, 69,000, so it is possible that the Mollusca are not the second most diverse phylum of animals in terms of recognized recent species. Naming rates for chordate are currently higher than for mollusk, 750 versus 600 species per year, although the Mollusca are regarded as having higher undescribed diversity. The Mollusca have long been considered the most species-rich marine phylum, but the estimate of 43,600 is substantially below the 56,000 species of Arthropoda listed in WoRMS. Globally, the ratio of marine gastropod to marine bivalve species in WoRMS is 4:1, which is higher than in any regional fauna, suggesting that gastropods have smaller geographic ranges on average than bivalves. The main remaining gaps in WoRMS are among opisthobranchs (8% missing) and Indo-Pacific marine mollusks (6%).

We applied three different modelling techniques: general additive models, random forests and fuzzy habitat suitability modelling (FHSM) to assess the habitat suitability of topmouth gudgeon. The former two techniques indicated that the abundance of native fish (i.e. biotic variables) was more important than environmental variables when determining the abundance of topmouth gudgeon in Flanders (Belgium). Bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and predator abundance were selected as the most important biotic variables and implemented in the FHSM to investigate species interactions. Depending on the preferred food source and spawning behaviour, either coexistence or interspecific competition can occur with bitterling, stone loach and three-spined stickleback.

We report how in both groups, opsins in deeper living species are calculated to be less compressible. This is largely due to a common set of amino acid sites (bovRH#159, 196, 213, 275) undergoing positive destabilizing selection in six of the twelve amino acid physiochemical properties that determine protein compressibility. This suggests a common evolutionary mechanism to reduce the adiabatic compressibility of opsin proteins.

This fragmentation makes assessing the conservation status of marine cave species especially problematic, and this issue should be addressed urgently given the stresses resulting from planned and rampant development in the coastal zone worldwide. The goal of the World Register of marine Cave Species (WoRCS) initiative is to create a comprehensive taxonomic and ecological database of known species from marine caves and anchialine systems worldwide and to present this as a Thematic Species Database (TSD) of the World Register of marine Species (WoRMS). WoRCS will incorporate ecological data (e.g., type of environment, salinity regimes, and cave zone) as well as geographical information on the distribution of species in cave and anchialine environments. Biodiversity data will be progressively assembled from individual database sources at regional, national or local levels, as well as from literature sources (estimate: >20,000 existing records of cave-dwelling species scattered in several databases). Information will be organized in the WoRCS database following a standard glossary based on existing terminology. Cave-related information will be managed by the WoRCS thematic editors with all data dynamically linked to WoRMS and its team of taxonomic editors. In order to mobilize data into global biogeographic databases, a Gazetteer of the Marine and Anchialine Caves of the World will be established.

In our results NIS were negatively correlated with the dimension of the protected areas and the intensity of the protection.

The hypothesis tested was that the diversity for all taxonomic groups would decrease with increasing latitude. The EMBOS system delivered accurate and comparable data on the diversity and densities of the soft sediment macrozoobenthic community over a large-scale gradient along the European coastline. In contrast to general biogeographic theory, species diversity showed no linear relationship with latitude, yet a bell-shaped relation was found. The diversity and densities of benthos were mostly positively correlated with environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, mud and organic matter content in sediment, or wave height, and related with location characteristics such as system type (lagoons, estuaries, open coast) or stratum (intertidal, subtidal). For some relationships, a maximum (e.g. temperature from 15–20°C; mud content of sediment around 40%) or bimodal curve (e.g. salinity) was found. In lagoons the densities were twice higher than in other locations, and at open coasts the diversity was much lower than in other locations. We conclude that latitudinal trends and regional differences in diversity and densities are strongly influenced by, i.e. merely the result of, particular sets and ranges of environmental factors and location characteristics specific to certain areas, such as the Baltic, with typical salinity clines (favouring insects) and the Mediterranean, with higher temperatures (favouring crustaceans). Therefore, eventual trends with latitude are primarily indirect and so can be overcome by local variation of environmental factors.","Hummel, H.; van Avesaath, P.; Wijnhoven, S.; Kleine-Schaars, L.; Degraer, S.; Kerckhof, F.; Bojanic, N.; Skejic, S.; Vidjak, O.; Rousou, M.; Orav-Kotta, H.; Kotta, J.; Jourde, J.; Pedrotti, M.L.; Leclerc, J.-C.; Simon, N.; Rigaut-Jalabert, F.; Bachelet, G.; Lavesque, N.; Arvanitidis, C.; Pavloudi, C.; Faulwetter, S.; Crowe, T.; Coughlan, J.; Benedetti-Cecchi, L.; dal Bello, M.; Magni, P.; Como, S.; Coppa, S.; Ikauniece, A.; Ruginis, T.; Jankowska, E.; Weslawski, J.M.; Warzocha, J.; Gromisz, S.; Witalis, B.; Silva, T.; Ribeiro, P.; De Matos, V.K.F.; Sousa-Pinto, I.; Veiga, P.; Troncoso, J.; Guinda, X.; De La Pena, J.A.J.; Puente, A.; Espinosa, F.; Pérez-Ruzafa, A.; Frost, M.; Mcneill, C.L.; Peleg, O.; Rilov, G.",WOS:000401585900006,"Kleine-Schaars, Loran, L.",EDS,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315416001119,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,soft sediment; benthos; species diversity; densities; harmonization of methods; European cline; biogeography; latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG),Journal article,NULL,NULL

Expected changes will be particularly strong in extratropical regions where temperatures will increase at faster rates than at lower latitudes. Despite that, it is still poorly constrained how precisely short-term climate dynamics will change in a generally warmer world, particularly in nearshore surface waters in the extratropics, i.e., the ecologically most productive regions of the ocean on which many human societies depend. Specifically, a detailed knowledge of the relationship between <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and seasonal SST is crucial to understand interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. In the present investigation, we have studied for the first time how rising atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> levels forced surface temperature changes in Central Europe (paleolatitude ~45 °N) during the mid-Oligocene (from ca. 31 to 25 Ma), a time interval of Earth history during which global conditions were comparable to those predicted for the next few centuries. For this purpose, we computed numerical climate models for the Oligocene (winter, summer, annual average) assuming an atmospheric carbon dioxide rise from 400 to 560 ppm (current level to two times pre-industrial levels, PAL) and from 400 to 840 ppm (= three times PAL), respectively. These models were compared to seasonally resolved sea surface temperatures (SST) reconstructed from δ<sup>18</sup>O values of fossil bivalve shells (<i>Glycymeris planicostalis</i>, <i>G. obovata</i>, <i>Palliolum pictum</i>, <i>Arctica islandica</i> and <i>Isognomon maxillata sandbergeri</i>) and shark teeth (<i>Carcharias cuspidata</i>, <i>C. acutissima</i> and <i>Physogaleus latus</i>) collected from the shallow water deposits of the Mainz and Kassel Basins (Germany). Multi-taxon oxygen isotope-based reconstructions suggest a gradual rise of temperatures in surface waters (upper 30 to 40 m), on average, by as much as 4 °C during the Rupelian stage followed by a 4 °C cooling during the Chattian stage. Seasonal temperature amplitudes increased by ca. 2 °C during the warmest time interval of the Rupelian stage, with warming being more pronounced during summer (5 °C) than during winter (3 °C). According to numerical climate simulations, the warming of surface waters during the early Oligocene required a CO<sub>2</sub> increase by at least 160 ppm, i.e., 400 ppm to 560 ppm. Given that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels predicted for the near future will likely exceed this value significantly, the Early Oligocene warming gives a hint of the possible future climate in Central Europe under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels.","Walliser, E.O.; Lohmann, G.; Niezgodzki, I.; Tütken, T.; Schöne, B.R.",WOS:000382591600038,"Walliser, E.O.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.07.033,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,"Global warming, ""Oxygen isotopes"", ""Sea surface temperature""",NULL,Sclerochronology; Bivalve shell; Shark tooth; ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here we trace the evolutionary history of the anomalous farmed shrimp using combined data phylogenetic analysis of living and fossil species. We show that exquisitely preserved fossils of †Antrimpos speciosus from the Late Jurassic Solnhofen limestone belong to the same clade as the species that dominate modern farming, dating the origin of this clade to at least 145 mya. This finding contradicts a much younger Late Cretaceous age (ca. 95 mya) previously estimated for this clade using molecular clocks. The species in the farmed shrimp clade defy a widespread tendency, by reaching relatively large body sizes despite their warm water lifestyles. Small body sizes have been shown to be physiologically favored in warm aquatic environments because satisfying oxygen demands is difficult for large organisms breathing in warm water. Our analysis shows that large-bodied, farmed shrimp have more gills than their smaller-bodied shallow-water relatives, suggesting that extra gills may have been key to the clade’s ability to meet oxygen demands at a large size.

We suggest this fluorescence to be produced by a “breakdown” product of the chemiluminescent reaction. Finally, both gland types probably evolved from a common light-emitting structure and differentiated along a functional and migrational axis extending from endocrine secretion close to the coelomic ramus to exocrine secretion close to the lateral margin of the pinna.","Gouveneaux, A.; Flood, P.R.; Erichsen, E.S.; Olsson, C.; Lindström, J.; Mallefet, J.",WOS:000404319600013,"Erichsen, Egil, E.S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jcz.2016.08.002,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,Bioluminescence,NULL,Pelagic annelid; Rosette gland; Hyaline gland; Chromophile gland; Tubular gland,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Also, this contribution points to and describes the much improved catch data underlying this website. These data now account for catches for all countries in the world by fisheries sectors (industrial, artisanal, subsistence, recreational), after augmenting the officially reported landings data through the inclusion of comprehensively reconstructed data of previously unreported catches and major discards, for every maritime country or territory in the world, and their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Also presented are the extensively improved spatial allocation procedures which assign global catch data to the 180,000 half degree spatial cells used by the Sea Around Us to subdivide the global ocean.

This new association will facilitate greater understanding and improved management of invasive alien species (IAS) and biological invasions globally, by developing a sustainable network of networks for effective knowledge exchange. In addition to their inclusion in the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, the increasing ecological, social, cultural and economic impacts associated with IAS have driven the development of multiple legal instruments and policies. This increases the need for greater co-ordination, co-operation, and information exchange among scientists, management, the community of practice and the public. INVASIVESNET will be formed by linking new and existing networks of interested stakeholders including international and national expert working groups and initiatives, individual scientists, database managers, thematic open access journals, environmental agencies, practitioners, managers, industry, non-government organisations, citizens and educational bodies. The association will develop technical tools and cyberinfrastructure for the collection, management and dissemination of data and information on IAS; create an effective communication platform for global stakeholders; and promote coordination and collaboration through international meetings, workshops, education, training and outreach. To date, the sustainability of many strategic national and international initiatives on IAS have unfortunately been hampered by time-limited grants or funding cycles. Recognising that IAS initiatives need to be globally coordinated and ongoing, we aim to develop a sustainable knowledge sharing association to connect the outputs of IAS research and to inform the consequential management and societal challenges arising from IAS introductions. INVASIVESNET will provide a dynamic and enduring network of networks to ensure the continuity of connections among the IAS community of practice, science and management.","Lucy, F.E.; Roy, H.; Simpson, A.; Carlton, J.T.; Hanson, J.M.; Magellan, K.; Campbell, M.L.; Costello, M.J.; Pagad, S.; Hewitt, C.L.; McDonald, J.; Cassey, P.; Thomaz, S.; Katsanevakis, S.; Zenetos, A.; Tricarico, E.; Boggero, A.; Groom, Q.; Adriaens, T.; Vanderhoeven, S.; Torchin, M.; Hufbauer, R.; Fuller, P.; Carman, M.R.; Conn, D.B.; Vitule, J.R.S.; Canning-Clode, J.; Galil, B.S.; Ojaveer, H.; Bailey, S.A.; Therriault, T.W.; Claudi, R.; Gazda, A.; Dick, J.T.A.; Caffrey, J.; Witt, A.; Kenis, M.; Lehtiniemi, M.; Helmisaari, H.; Panov, V.E.",WOS:000422636600001,"Torchin, Marc, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3391/mbi.2016.7.2.01,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,knowledge flows; network of networks; sustainable; IAS management; communication platform,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Image annotation - the process of transposing objects or events represented in a video or still image to the semantic level, may involve human interactions and computer-assisted solutions. Marine image annotation software (MIAS) have enabled over 500 publications to date. We review the functioning, application trends and developments, by comparing general and advanced features of 23 different tools utilized in underwater image analysis. MIAS requiring human input are basically a graphical user interface, with a video player or image browser that recognizes a specific time code or image code, allowing to log events in a time-stamped (and/or geo-referenced) manner. MIAS differ from similar software by the capability of integrating data associated to video collection, the most simple being the position coordinates of the video recording platform. MIAS have three main characteristics: annotating events in real time, in posteriorly to annotation and interact with a database. These range from simple annotation interfaces, to full onboard data management systems, with a variety of toolboxes. Advanced packages allow to input and display of data from multiple sensors or multiple annotators via intranet or internet. Posterior human-mediated annotation often include tools for data display and image analysis, e.g. length, area, image segmentation, point count; and in a few cases the possibility of browsing and editing previous dive logs or to analyze annotation data. The interaction with a database allows the automatic integration of annotations from different surveys, repeated annotation and collaborative annotation of shared datasets, browsing and querying of data. Progress in the field of automated annotation is mostly in post processing, for stable platforms or still images. Integration into available MIAS is currently limited to semi-automated processes of pixel recognition through computer-vision modules that compile expert-based knowledge. Important topics aiding the choice of a specific software are outlined, the ideal software is discussed and future trends are presented.","Gomes-Pereira, J.N.; Auger, V.; Beisiegel, K.; Benjamin, R.; Bergmann, M.; Bowden, D.; Buhl-Mortensen, P.; De Leo, F.C.; Dionísio, G.; Durden, J.M.; Edwards, L.; Friedman, A.; Greinert, J.; Jacobsen-Stout, N.; Lerner, S.; Leslie, M.; Nattkemper, T.W.; Sameoto, J.A.; Schoening, T.; Schouten, R.; Seager, J.; Singh, H.; Soubigou, O.; Tojeira, I.; van den Beld, I.; Dias, F.; Tempera, F.; Santos, R.S.",WOS:000390723200006,"Dias, Frederico, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2016.07.005,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Underwater visual surveys; image analysis; image annotation; data collection; data storage; monitoring; marine imaging,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Understanding these changes requires a multidisciplinary approach to bring together patterns identified within long-term datasets and the processes driving those patterns using biologically relevant mechanistic information to accurately attribute cause and effect. This must include likely future biological responses, and detection of the underlying mechanisms in order to scale up from the organismal level to determine how communities and ecosystems are likely to respond across a range of future climate change scenarios.

Common analytical methods (e.g. immunoassays), however, suffer from cross-reaction with other steroids, leading to potential overestimation of CORT concentrations which can obscure true hormone–environment relationships and complicate among-study comparisons. We here apply a new LC-MS/MS technique, which has recently been shown to avoid the problem of cross-reactivity due to its high specificity, to quantify CORT concentrations in yolk and albumen in clutches of lesser black-backed gulls <i>Larus fuscus</i>. We found that CORT concentration exhibited a previously unreported U-shaped relationship with time of breeding, which we explain as a potential interplay of two forces exerting extra strain on the early and late breeders. Furthermore, results showed an increase in CORT with laying order indicating the energetic expense of egg production. The levels of CORT assessed in this study were significantly lower than those previously reported in studies using immunoassays for CORT analysis. This supports the fact that incorporating chromatography effectively reduces overestimation of CORT due to cross-reactivity with other steroid hormones, particularly in egg yolk.","Larsen, T.R.; Fairhurst, G.D.; De Baere, S.; Croubels, S.; Müller, W.; De Neve, L.; Lens, L.",WOS:000367687400011,"Larsen, Tom, T.R.","Ghent Univ., Dept of Biology, Terrestrial Ecology Unit",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.00735,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This paper examines how the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), as a competent international organisation for marine scientific research and technology transfer, can inform the development of the instrument. Synergies between marine technology transfer and non-monetary benefit sharing of genetic resources are illustrated. Four key lessons from the IOC are examined: 1.

Facilitating capacity development through scientific training and education; and 4. Governance of marine scientific research.

However, recent studies of hemichordate phylogeny and taxonomy suggest the species number has been largely underestimated. One issue is that species must be described by experts, and historically few taxonomists have studied this group of marine invertebrates. Despite this previous lack of coverage, interest in hemichordates has piqued in the past couple of decades, as they are critical to understanding the evolution of chordates–as acorn worms likely resemble the deuterostome ancestor more closely than any other extant animal. This review provides an overview of our current knowledge of hemichordates, focusing specifically on their global biodiversity, geographic distribution, and taxonomy. Using information available in the World Register of Marine Species and published literature, we assembled a list of 130 described, extant species. The majority (83%) of these species are enteropneusts, and more taxonomic descriptions are forthcoming. Ptychoderidae contained the greatest number of species (41 species), closely followed by Harrimaniidae (40 species), of the recognized hemichordate families.

Additionally, we find that marine clades continue to show evidence of increased speciation rates with cooler global temperatures, while the single freshwater clade shows the opposite trend with speciation rates positively correlated to global warming. Our findings suggest that both global cooling and warming lead to diversification and that habitat plays a role in the responses of species to climate change.

The time series spanning the period 2002-2015 was modeled using a non-parametric generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) suited for non-normal and non-linear data. The main objectives of the study was: i) to come up with the best GAMM model for predicting Chlorophyll a (CHLa) in the Belgian coastal zone (BCZ), that could explain the seasonal cycle and long-term trend by utilizing the fewest number of predictors (environmental variables); ii) to investigate whether the seasonal cycle for blooms differed between different locations in the BCZ; iii) To determine the long-term trend and see if the management strategies in the BCZ were effective or required modifications in the reduction of harmful algal blooms (HABs) that recur annually. The Chlorophyll a pigment was elucidated by smooth functions for the long-term trend, seasonal cycle per zone, SPM, salinity and silicate concentration. The GAMM simulated seasonal trends for the southwest (SW), middle and northeast (NE) zones and showed that the shape for all the zones differed in magnitude, timing and duration (p<0.001). Silicate was strongly correlated to other nutrients, while salinity was found to increase with oceanic influences as reflected in the water transparency and light availability. SPM indicated the influence of freshwater runoff. The long-term trends indicate consistent reduction in nutrient levels for the period of 2002-2015 with the blooms condition producing more distinctive peaks than before but the mean value had remained steady since 2010. Changes in the seasonal patterns are probably an indication that either the community structure is shifting towards less silicified diatoms or non-siliceous forms that are impacting on the biomass.

Temporal and spatial zooplankton dynamics in a multistressor environment (Belgian part of the North Sea). MSc Thesis. Oceans & Lakes, Interuniversity Master in Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management: Antwerpen, Gent and Brussel. 54 pp.","Climate change, eutrophication and pollution are worldwide known to cause pressure on the marine environment. In the BNPS, earlier investigations have demonstrated seasonal and spatial changes in zooplankton density and distribution. Zooplankton communities are considered as good indicators of environmental stressors. However, the interactive and cumulative effects of physical and chemical factors on these organisms remain unclear. In this research, spatial and temporal dynamics of zooplankton communities in relation to environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, nutrients and toxicants were analyzed. Zooplankton samples were collected with a WP2 zooplankton net from winter to spring: February, April and May 2015 in the BNPS, along a nearshore-midshore axis with four selected stations. Environmental parameters, nutrient and  Vessel <i>(RV) Simon Stevin</i>. The packages Primer v6, R and SPSS Statistics 23 were used for statistical analysis. This study revealed distinct spatial (nearshore and midshore) and temporal/seasonal variations both in the overall zooplankton and copepod communities. Zooplankton densities were often higher in the nearshore than in the midshore stations of the BNPS and increased from winter to spring. Zooplankton total densities differed significantly between stations (p= 0.001 and months (p= 0.001). Similarly, significant differences in total density between stations (p= 0.001) and months (p= 0.001) were found in the copepod community. The most abundant zooplankton groups in the BNPS were the copepods (Phylum Arthropoda) and the appendicularians (Phylum Chordata). The dominant copepods were the calanoids (order Calanoida) represented by <i>Acartia clausi, Temora longicornis, Paracalanus parvus, Centropages hamatus, Pseudocalanus elongatus Calanus sp. and Centropages typicus. Acartia clausi</i> and <i>Temora longicornis</i> were the most abundant calanoid species in the area. These seasonal and spatial variations were significantly related to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and PCB concentrations. Temperature was the variable which explained best density variations. The case study of Temora longicornis demonstrated environmental factors also influenced copepod body size. Mean prosome lengths of Temora longicornis were significantly correlated to temperature (p = 0.0001, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.954), salinity (p= 0.0001, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.851) and nutrient concentrations (p= 0.0001, r<sup>2</sup> = - 0.686). Besides, significant correlations between densities of Temora longicornis and temperature (p= 0.0001, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.786), PCB52 concentrations (p= 0.003, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.496) and PAH concentrations (p= 0.006, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.465) were found. This paper indicated temperature is the most important abiotic factor influencing zooplankton community structure. Cumulative and interactive effects of climate change with eutrophication and pollution on zooplankton community have been less examined so far and require special attention in the BNPS. Further investigations are needed to better understand the responses of zooplankton to multiple environmental stressors.","Rakotondrazafy, S.R.A.",NULL,"Rakotondrazafy, Sariaka Ravaka Andrianavalona, S.R.A.","Interuniversity Master in Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management, University of Brussels, University of Ghent and University of Antwerp",NULL,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,"Calanoida, ""Copepoda""",Zooplankton,NULL,Copepods; calanoids; temporal/seasonal and spatial dynamics; environmental stressors; Belgian part of the North Sea (BNPS)  ,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc

From a range of ecological and biological criteria, we identified eight criteria commonly used to identify areas for biodiversity conservation across these initiatives. Four criteria identified areas that (1) contained unique and rare habitats; (2) included fragile and sensitive habitats; (3) were important for ecological integrity; and (4) were representative of all habitats. Another four criteria were based on species' attributes, including (5) the presence of species of conservation concern; (6) the occurrence of restricted-range species; (7) species richness; and (8) importance for life history stages. Information required to inform these criteria include: habitat cover, species occurrence, species richness, species' geographic range and population abundance.

The current scarcity of scientific observations of cetaceans in the high seas impedes the assessment of population-level impacts of these activities. This study is directed towards an important management need in the high seas—the development of plausible density estimates to facilitate a quantitative assessment of anthropogenic impacts on cetacean populations in these waters. Our study region extends from a well-surveyed region within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone into a large region of the western North Atlantic sparsely surveyed for cetaceans. We modeled densities of 15 cetacean taxa using available line transect survey data and habitat covariates and extrapolated predictions to sparsely surveyed regions. We formulated models carefully to reduce the extent of extrapolation beyond covariate ranges, and constrained them to model simple and generalizable relationships. To evaluate confidence in the predictions, we performed several qualitative assessments, such as mapping where predictions were made outside sampled covariate ranges, and comparing them with maps of sightings from a variety of sources that could not be integrated into our models. Our study revealed a range of confidence levels for the model results depending on the taxon and geographic area, and highlights the need for additional surveying in environmentally distinct areas. Combined with their explicit confidence levels and necessary caution, our density estimates can inform a variety of management needs in the high seas, such as the quantification of potential cetacean interactions with military training exercises, shipping, fisheries, deep-sea mining, as well as delineation of areas of special biological significance in international waters.

The biologic processes that determine production, sink, and aerobic respiration of organic material, as a function of available N, are coupled with the sensitivity of demersal species to hypoxia to derive an indicator of the Ecosystem Response (ER) to N-uptake.

Monitoring biodiversity in this area is crucial as this region is particularly susceptible to biological invasions and temperature alteration. Historical biodiversity data could provide a useful baseline for monitoring potential changes and provide informarion to support a better understanding of the possible effects of anthropogenic activities on marine benthic communities.New information: In this study, performed under the LifeWatchGreece Research Infrastructure, we present historical benthic occurrence data obtained from the sampling expedition carried out in 1933 by Adolf Steuer in the coastal area around Alexandria, Egypt, eastern Mediterranean. The occurrences were geo-referenced to more than 170 stations, mostly located in the area of Alexandria, and the nearby coasts and lakes. All records were digitized and species names were cross-checked and taxonomically updated using the World Register of Marine Species. The outcome clearly shows that such initiatives can reveal an unexpected amount of highly valuable biodiversity information for “data-poor” regions.","Tsikopoulou, I.; Legaki, A.; Dimitriou, P.D.; Avramidou, E.; Bailly, N.; Nikolopoulou, S.",WOS:000449618200004,"Bailly, Nicolas, N.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.4.e10071,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Marine biodiversity; macrofauna; Egypt expedition; eastern Mediterranean; historical dataset; data digitization; data rescue,Data paper,NULL,NULL

A pH gradient associated with a natural volcanic vent system within Levante Bay, Vulcano Island, Italy, was used to test the effects of ocean acidification on the bacterial community of two anemone species in situ, Anemonia viridis and Actinia equina using 16 S rDNA pyrosequencing. Results showed the bacterial community of the two anemone species differed significantly from each other primarily because of differences in the Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria abundances. The bacterial communities did not differ within species among sites with decreasing pH except for A. viridis at the vent site (pH = 6.05). In addition to low pH, the vent site contains trace metals and sulfide that may have influenced the bacteria community of A. viridis. The stability of the bacterial community from pH 8.1 to pH 7.4, coupled with previous experiments showing the lack of, or beneficial changes within anemones living under low pH conditions indicates that A. viridis and A. equina will be winners under future ocean acidification scenarios.","Muller, E.M.; Fine, M.; Ritchie, K.B.",WOS:000388344800001,"Muller, Erinn, E.M.","Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep37387,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

As a step to defining such efforts, we review current methods of collecting and managing marine biodiversity data. A fundamental component of marine biodiversity is knowing what, where, and when species are present. However, monitoring methods are invariably biased in what taxa, ecological guilds, and body sizes they collect. In addition, the data need to be placed, and/or mapped, into an environmental context. Thus a suite of methods will be needed to encompass representative components of biodiversity in an ecosystem. Some sampling methods can damage habitat and kill species, including unnecessary bycatch. Less destructive alternatives are preferable, especially in conservation areas, such as photography, hydrophones, tagging, acoustics, artificial substrata, light-traps, hook and line, and live-traps. Here we highlight examples of operational international sampling programmes and data management infrastructures, notably the Continuous Plankton Recorder, Reef Life Survey, and detection of Harmful Algal Blooms and MarineGEO. Data management infrastructures include the World Register of Marine Species for species nomenclature and attributes, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System for distribution data, Marine Regions for maps, and Global Marine Environmental Datasets for global environmental data. Existing national sampling programmes, such as fishery trawl surveys and intertidal surveys, may provide a global perspective if their data can be integrated to provide useful information. Less utilised and emerging sampling methods, such as artificial substrata, light-traps, microfossils and eDNA also hold promise for sampling the less studied components of biodiversity. All of these initiatives need to develop international standards and protocols, and long-term plans for their governance and support.","Costello, M.J.; Basher, Z.; McLeod, L.; Asaad, I.; Claus, S.; Vandepitte, L.; Yasuhara, M.; Gislason, H.; Edwards, M.; Appeltans, W.; Enevoldsen, H.; Edgar, G.J.; Miloslavich, P.; De Monte, S.; Pinto, I.S.; Obura, D.; Bates, A.E.",NULL,"McLeod, Laura, L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-27288-7_6,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Biodiversity, ""Methods"", ""Monitoring"", ""Sampling""",NULL,NULL,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species’ habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013–2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001–2014). The models showed that the presence of <i>C. mutica</i> is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The <i>C. linearis</i> model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity.

Analysis comparing the similarity of species among nine regions indicates that there is greater similarity in species composition between contiguous regions than between non-contiguous regions and suggests that there are four zoogeographic clusters in eastern Canada. Our checklists can inform managers and policymakers of the diversity of the ascidian taxa and can minimise taxonomic uncertainties of established non-indigenous and prospective invading species, for example, by identifying indigenous species that are congeners of non-indigenous species. The maintenance of checklists can be a valuable tool for the management of non-indigenous species as baselines to estimate changes in richness and to document the invasion status of non-indigenous species over time. For example, more importance can be placed on the spread of non-indigenous ascidians from one zoogeographic cluster to another than spread within the same cluster.","Ma, K.C.K.; Deibel, D.; Law, K.K.M.; Aoki, M.; McKenzie, C.H.; Palomares, M.L.D.",WOS:000393802100007,"Ma, Kevin Cam Kau, K.C.K.","Univ Laval, Quebec Ocean, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1139/cjz-2016-0087,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Ascidiacea,Zoogeography,NULL,Ascidians; indigenous; non indigenous; cryptogenic; species richness; eastern Canada,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Here we analyse the diversification rates of nearly 80% of the actinopterygian fish families in relation to biological traits and habitat factors associated with isolation and fragmentation levels.Location Global: Methods Net diversification rate for each family was estimated using the method-of-moments estimator for stem-group ages. Phylogenetic generalized least-squares analysis (PGLS), controlling for the non-independence between clades due to phylogeny, was applied with diversification rate as the response variable to test the effects of mean body size, proportions of strictly freshwater, reef-associated and migratory species and including the median latitudinal distribution and range of each family.Results: After accounting for the phylogenetic relatedness of families and for their latitudinal distribution, we found strong support in agreement with our isolation and fragmentation hypotheses: predominance of freshwater dependence, reef-association, small body size or non-migratory behaviour in families is related to more rapid rates of diversification. We also found a highly significant and positive effect of latitudinal range and no clear effect of median latitude.Main conclusions: This analysis suggests that factors related to the physical fragmentation of habitats and to lower dispersal ability of species have played an important role in the diversification processes of the most diverse group of vertebrates.","Tedesco, P.A.; Paradis, E.; Lévêque, C.; Hugueny, B.",WOS:000398571000006,"Paradis, Emmanuel, E.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.12905,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,Actinopterygii,"Biogeography, ""Diversification"", ""Fragmentation"", ""Speciation""",NULL,Actinopterygian fish; Biological traits,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Species richness was plotted in 5° latitude–longitude cells and related to environmental variables.Results: The north-west Pacific and the Indo-West Pacific have the highest species richness (about 85% of all species)–mostly in the Sea of Japan, China Sea, the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Cluster analysis of similarity patterns of species composition (i.e., presence of Solenidae species) for 5° latitudinal–longitudinal grid cells showed 16 significant biogeographical regions that concur with existing marine biogeographical hypotheses. More than half of the species were endemic to specific biogeographical regions. The geographical distribution of species in 5° latitudinal bands showed a significant bimodal pattern. Global patterns of species richness increased from the poles to intermediate latitudes and dipped near the equator. A non-linear relationship between species richness and mean sea-surface temperature (SST) values was compatible with this bimodal pattern. Two inflection points of species richness with correlation of SST at 12 °C (low species richness) and 28 °C (high species richness) were coincident with the bimodal latitudinal species richness pattern. Species richness was highly positively correlated with mean SST over all latitudes, and within the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Species richness decreased with SST range over all latitudes and in the Northern Hemisphere. Species richness also decreased with chlorophyll-a concentration and primary productivity, but increased with ocean area in the Northern Hemisphere (only).Main conclusions: The latitudinal distribution in species richness of Solenidae peaked at 10° N and 25° S rather than at the equator, exhibiting a strongly bimodal pattern that is likely to be temperature driven.","Saeedi, H.; Dennis, T.E.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000395100600011,"Saeedi, Hanieh, H.","Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.12903,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Solenidae,"Endemicity, ""Sea surface temperature""",NULL,biogeographical region; continental-shelf area; latitudinal diversity gradient; razor clams; tropical,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The dynamic nature of the sea caused by waves, boat wakes, and weather conditions poses huge challenges for the development of a stable background model. Moreover, camera motion, reflections, lightning and illumination changes may contribute to false detections. Dynamic background subtraction (DBGS) is widely considered as a solution to tackle this issue in the scope of vessel detection for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, the DBGS techniques suggested for ships are investigated and optimized for the monitoring and tracking of birds in marine video content. In addition to background subtraction, foreground candidates are filtered by a classifier based on their feature descriptors in order to remove non-bird objects. Different types of classifiers have been evaluated and results on a ground truth labeled dataset of challenging video fragments show similar levels of precision and recall of about 95% for the best performing classifier. The remaining foreground items are counted and birds are tracked along the video sequence using spatio-temporal motion prediction. This allows marine scientists to study the presence and behavior of birds.","T'Jampens, R.; Hernandez, F.; Vandecasteele, F.; Verstockt, S.",WOS:000393589800083,"Vandecasteele, Florian, F.","Data Science Lab, UGent-iMinds",https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2016.7821031,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,Aves,"Detection, ""Marine birds""",NULL,dynamic background subtraction; texture analysis; image classification; object detection; seabirds,Book chapters,Conference paper,NULL

Using ‘maximum entropy’, a species distribution modelling software, we predicted the most suitable environments for the entire family and 14 Solen species to indicate their present and future geographic distributions. Distance to land, depth, and sea surface temperature (SST) were the most important environmental variables in training and creating the present and future distribution models both at the family and species level. In the present distribution models at the family level, the most suitable environment was where distance to land was between 0 and 100 km, a depth of 0–150 m, wave height of 5–7 m, a mean chlorophyll-a concentration about 0.7 mg m<sup>−3</sup>, and mean SST between 12 and 28 °C. Comparison with the future distribution models at the species level, found that most species were predicted to shift their distribution ranges poleward under the future environmental scenarios; i.e. species in the northern hemisphere would shift northward and southern species southward. Models also predicted that half of the species would expand their distribution ranges, 29% of species would not change their distribution, and 21% of species would shrink their distribution ranges under future climate change. Expanding geographic ranges would result in overlap in species ranges and thus greater species richness at regional scales. Model results predict that the mid-latitude peaks of species richness will move further apart, increasing the dip in richness near the equator, due to global climate change.","Saeedi, H.; Basher, Z.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000390205200001,"Saeedi, Hanieh, H.","Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s10152-016-0477-4,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,Mollusca,NULL,NULL,Species distribution modelling MaxEnt Climate change Range shifts Mollusca Ocean Biogeographic Information System Global Biodiversity Information Facility,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In the marine realm forecasts have usually focused on taxa representing the top of the marine food-web, thus overlooking their basal component: the plankton. Calibrating environmental niche models at the global scale, we modelled the habitat suitability of 106 copepod species and estimated the dissimilarity between present and future zooplanktonic assemblages in the surface Mediterranean Sea. We identified the patterns (species replacement versus nestedness) driving the predicted dissimilarity, and quantified the relative contributions of different uncertainty sources: environmental niche models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, circulation model configurations, and species prevalence. Our results confirm that the choice of the niche modelling method is the greatest source of uncertainty in habitat suitability projections. Presence-only and presence-absence methods provided different visions of the niches, which subsequently lead to different future scenarios of biodiversity changes. Nestedness with decline in species richness is the pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future copepod assemblages. Our projections contrast with those reported for higher trophic levels, suggesting that different components of the pelagic food-web may respond discordantly to future climatic changes.","Benedetti, F.; Guilhaumon, F.; Adloff, F.; Ayata, S.-D.",WOS:000423807400009,"Adloff, Fanny, F.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.02434,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Indices incorporating species sensitivities, richness and densities are commonly applied. In Europe, the importance of benthic indices has increased in the last years with the implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) which at the same time demands the applicability of an index across regional scales. To date, environmental variability is rarely considered in benthic indices and most sensitivity rankings have the disadvantages of static values (i.e. the same value in all areas), expert judgement and a limited geographical range.    This study presents species sensitivity values calculated along environmental gradients for the Baltic Sea. Sensitivities were calculated according to the procedure of the Benthic Quality Index (BQI). We created a matrix of subregions, classes of salinity, depth and gear to identify comparable subsets for data analysis. Altogether, 19 subsets were defined within the Baltic Sea basins. Sensitivity values were calculated for 329 species out of a total of 678 species that were recorded in this study. Sensitivity values of taxa vary between subsets as it was expected for different environmental conditions. Most sensitivity values can be assigned to species occurring in euhaline and polyhaline waters. Distribution of species with high and low sensitivity values differed along the salinity gradient. In euhaline waters more species with high sensitivity values occurred than species with low sensitivity values, while in mesohaline waters the ratio of high and low sensitivity values among species was almost equal. In oligohaline waters more species with lower sensitivity values were present.    For the first time, sensitivity values were calculated for a large number of species using the same method for the entire Baltic Sea. This results in a Baltic-wide comprehensive set of sensitivity values based on a dataset across subregional borders, and divided along environmental gradients and gear type. The same principles can be applied to transient waters from rivers to coastal lagoons as well as to other environments with gradients of, e.g. hydrodynamic characteristics. Publicly available sensitivity values will increase transparency and support the improvement of state assessments under the MSFD.","Schiele, K.S.; Darr, A.; Zettler, M.L.; Berg, T.; Blomqvist, M.; Daunys, D.; Jermakovs, V.; Korpinen, S.; Kotta, J.; Nygård, H.; von Weber, M.; Voss, J.; Warzocha, J.",WOS:000367411200031,"Berg, Torsten, T.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.09.046,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Species sensitivity; Benthic Quality Index (BQI); Salinity gradient; Environmental assessment; Baltic Sea; Macrozoobenthos,Journal article,NULL,NULL

One of the most significant components of the coastal neustonic fauna is the benthohyponeuston migrating diurnally between benthic and neustonic realms. Data on this fauna are fragmentary and contradictory, partly due to lack of the criteria to distinguish benthohyponeuston from other benthopelagic animals diurnally migrating to the bulk water from the seafloor. We propose a criterion to quantify the degree of aggregation/avoidance of the neustal zone, reveal four distinct ecological groups and describe patterns of their overnight dynamics. Benthohyponeuston appears in open water at sunset, its biomass most rapidly increases one hour after sunset. Cumaceans, mysids and polychaetes make significant contribution during first three hours after sunset. Decapods are important around midnight and 3 h later. Amphipods are significant overnight. By analogy with the benthopelagic species, we define the benthohyponeuston as benthic animals, which are associated with the neustal zone at least at one stage of their life cycle. This association is necessary for reproduction, dispersal or feeding – that represent three basic pathways connecting neustonic and benthic/benthopelagic coastal communities below. The data on benthohyponeuston and patterns of its overnight dynamics will help in a better understanding of vertical migrations in the coastal zone and in estimating diurnal fluxes of organic matter.","Vereshchaka, A.L.; Anokhina, L.L.",WOS:000367630400017,"Vereshchaka, Alexander, A.L.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2015.10.030,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Amphipoda, ""Cumacea"", ""Decapoda"", ""Mysidacea""",NULL,NULL,    Neuston; Benthohyponeuston; Coastal plankton; Benthopelagic animals; Amphipoda; Decapoda; Mysidacea; Cumacea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We used micro-CT to characterize the gizzard musculature, the food which is present at different stages of the digestion process and the working surface of the gizzard plates. We show that the gizzard plates are used to crush the shelled prey, and that the functional mode of the small unpaired plate is different from the larger plates. All 3 plates are composed of a mixture of amorphous calcium carbonate and amorphous calcium phosphate embedded in a chitinous matrix. The proportions of these two mineral phases vary systematically within the plate. The plates have a complex layered structure, whose elastic moduli and hardness also vary in a continuous systematic manner. We observed that the stiffest layer is below the working surface, unlike most teeth where the stiffest layer is at the surface. Rigorous analysis of the elasticity indices of the gizzard plates as compared with sea urchin teeth and synthetic calcite provided insights into the connection between the biological function and the mechanical properties of biological composites.

After habitat destruction or modification, invasive species are responsible for more biological extinctions than any other cause. Further, the rate of extinction of native species has been higher on islands than anywhere else in the world. Invasive species have also degraded native ecosystems. In order to detect exotic intertidal mollusk species, an extensive sampling around Moorea Island, a more or less unspoiled island surrounded by a rich coral reef habitat, has been developed considering that sampled points have different characteristics in wave exposure, algae coverage, type of substrate, distance to ports, distance to freshwater, distance sewage and boat traffic. Samples were DNA barcoded for unequivocal species assignation.    The presence of five NIS among 26 species seems an important signal of introduction of alien biota in Moorea Island coast. However they were represented by a total of 38 individuals among 1487 mollusks (2.55%). While the distance to relatively big ports influenced directly species richness, the intensity of maritime traffic measured as boat density near sampling points was significantly associated with the frequency of exotic species. Other environmental factors did not show significant correlation with the frequency of exotics, suggesting that in an environment without big discontinuities, with little habitat modification, local boat traffic is the most influential factor in the spread of exotic species.

The relative phylogenetic position of Cerithioidea with respect to Hypsogastropoda remains unresolved. The monophyly of Hypsogastropoda (without Vermetoidea) is strongly supported. Within this clade, Littorinimorpha should be considered a grade. Several superfamilies (Abyssochrysoidea, Rissooidea, Truncatelloidea, and Naticoidea) branched off successively before a siphonate clade (Stromboidea, Cypraeoidea, Tonnoidea, Neogastropoda), which is strongly supported. The relative phylogenetic position of Vermetoidea could not be determined due to long-branch attraction artifacts. The superfamily Tonnoidea was recovered within Neogastropoda, which questions the monophyly of the latter as traditionally defined.

Phytoplankton analyses were carried out in 1975–1976 and then (almost) continuously since 1987. We report an investigation of ‘the balance of organisms’ in phytoplankton in relation to reductions in phosphorus loading, using two new tools based on phytoplankton lifeforms: the Plankton Index for Phytoplankton (PIp); Euclidean distance in state-space. Our results show the utility of the tools for analysing changes in the ‘balance of organisms’ at the level of functional groups (in our study diatoms and dinoflagellates), but also illustrate the difficulties in demonstrating the reversal of human impacts resulting from eutrophication.    The comparison between 1987–89 and 1976 showed the expected ‘de-eutrophication’ due to the reduction in dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP), with a decrease in dinoflagellate abundance. Since 1989, year-to-year variation in annual mean concentrations of DIP may have contributed to inter-annual variability in the balance of the two lifeforms, but the data suggest that the system has remained in a dynamically stable regime because: (1) there was no long-term trend in Euclidean distance from the reference; and (2) there was no increase in inter-annual variability about the time-series mean Euclidean distance suggesting there has been no decrease in resilience which might signal a regime change.    Integrated management of human activities will be required to manage (and reduce) total P in the system.

We analysed a unique (large) collection of phytoplankton monitoring data covering 86 coastal sites distributed over eight regions in North America and Europe, with the aim of investigating common patterns in the seasonal timing and species composition of the blooms. The spring bloom was the most common seasonal pattern across all regions, typically occurring early (February–March) at lower latitudes and later (April–May) at higher latitudes. Bloom frequency, defined as the probability of unusually high biomass, ranged from 5 to 35% between sites and followed no consistent patterns across gradients of latitude, temperature, salinity, water depth, stratification, tidal amplitude or nutrient concentrations. Blooms were mostly dominated by a single species, typically diatoms (58% of the blooms) and dinoflagellates (19%). Diatom-dominated spring blooms were a common feature in most systems, although dinoflagellate spring blooms were also observed in the Baltic Sea. Blooms dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were only common in low salinity waters and occurred mostly at higher temperatures. Key bloom species across the eight regions included the diatoms <i>Cerataulina pelagica</i> and <i>Dactyliosolen fragilissimus</i> and dinoflagellates <i>Heterocapsa triquetra</i> and <i>Prorocentrum cordatum</i>. Other frequent bloom-forming taxa were diatom genera <i>Chaetoceros</i>, <i>Coscinodiscus</i>, <i>Skeletonema</i>, and <i>Thalassiosira</i>. Our meta-analysis shows that these 86 estuarine-coastal sites function as diatom-producing systems, the timing of that production varies widely, and that bloom frequency is not associated with environmental factors measured in monitoring programs.

This was carried out via a lattice of 64 spatially referenced stations. Although densities of individual components were patchily dispersed across the locality, rank orders of importance of the 14 functional groups present, their overall functional diversity and evenness, and the proportions of the total individuals contained within each showed, in contrast, statistically significant spatial uniformity, even at areal scales <2 m2. Analysis of the proportional importance of the functional groups in their geospatial context also revealed weaker than expected levels of spatial autocorrelation, and then only at the smaller scales and amongst the most dominant groups, and only a small number of negative correlations occurred between the proportional importances of the individual groups. In effect, such patterning was a surface veneer overlying remarkable stability of assemblage functional composition across all spatial scales. Although assemblage species composition is known to be homogeneous in some soft-sediment marine systems over equivalent scales, this combination of patchy individual components yet basically constant functional-group structure seems as yet unreported.","Barnes, R.S.K.; Hamylton, S.",WOS:000353080900009,"Barnes, R.S.K.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.03.006,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Autocorrelation; Functional analysis; Sea grass; Spatial dispersion; Spatial variation; Zoobenthos,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The time series has been initiated in 1962 and based on the resulting counts a taxon list of 261 taxa has been assembled, 93 of which are diatoms. However, plankton research has been carried out at the site since the 19th century although many old records were lost during the World War II. Here we describe a small historic data set that was recovered from the Wadden Sea Station Sylt and placed in the AWI's own archive, the Archive for German Polar Research (Archiv für deutsche Polarforschung — AdP). This data set is unique in that it contains species specific diatom data from the period 1906–1908. As the data set itself contained only little direct metadata linking it to the phytoplankton monitoring site Helgoland Roads (‘Helgoland Reede’ in German), further research of the available literature and additional searches of material in the AWI archive were carried out before it could be ascertained that the documents recovered from Sylt really contained data from the Biological Institute on the island of Helgoland. Following this the data in the original data set underwent taxonomic checks to establish that all species were valid species or older synonyms of currently accepted taxon names. The resulting data set was then compared to the Helgoland Roads taxon list and the most current published checklist for Helgoland Roads. Of the 6 pennate and 59 centric diatoms recorded between 1906 and 1908 most are also found in the current taxon lists, only 7 were not found in either the checklist or Helgoland Roads taxon list. However, there are exceptions, most notably the centric diatom Pseudosolenia calcar-avis, which only occurred in the historic records of 1906–1908 and has not been reported from the North Sea in any modern records.

Yet, environmental monitoring and assessment of community changes in relation to both natural and human sources of disturbance involves considerable efforts for sample processing and time-consuming identifications of organisms, which make challenging large-scale and continuous monitoring programs required under the current regulatory frameworks at European scale. The use of higher taxa (e.g. families) as surrogates for species is a mainstream approach to reduce cost and time associated to fine taxonomic resolution in environmental studies, especially concerning macro-invertebrate communities. However, this approach of ‘taxonomic sufficiency’ simply relies on the static grouping of organisms in taxa belonging to a single higher taxonomic level irrespective of their ecological relevance or difficulties in their taxonomic identification, leading to unnecessary losses of taxonomic detail or ecological information. A new approach, namely the Best Practicable Aggregation of Species (BestAgg), has been recently developed as an alternative procedure for species surrogacy. BestAgg is based on aggregating species in the minimum number of surrogates sufficient to depict species-level community patterns consistently, while capitalizing on ecological information. Although the approach has been successfully applied to marine and freshwater invertebrate assemblages, its effectiveness in transitional water systems, where the complex and highly variable environmental conditions may affect the performance of surrogacy methods, still remain untested. Here, we applied the BestAgg approach to quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of variability of macro-invertebrate assemblages from Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Northern Adriatic Sea). Surrogates were defined using species-level data from a representative lagoon system, which served as pilot study. Then, they were used to analyze macro-invertebrate assemblages in two independent lagoons in the same geographic area. Results showed that BestAgg surrogates were effective in depicting multivariate patterns of macro-invertebrate assemblages as at species level over and beyond potential variations among the investigated lagoons. The use of families, following a more classic approach based on taxonomic sufficiency, also provided results comparable to those obtained using species. However, with respect to families, BestAgg surrogates allowed an estimated timesaving of 40% higher while still retaining an equivalent amount of information on species-level patterns. More importantly, BestAgg allowed exploiting different criteria of species aggregation, leading to a set of surrogates more aligned with ecological/functional characteristics of organisms, suggesting that BestAgg approach may provide a fresh perspective for optimizing trade-offs between pragmatism and the need for relevant ecological information in environmental assessment and monitoring.","Bevilacqua, S.; Terlizzi, A.; Mistri, M.; Munari, C.",WOS:000350918600023,"Munari, Cristina, C.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Coastal lagoons; Indicators; Macro-benthic invertebrates; Null models; Species surrogacy; Taxonomic sufficiency,Journal article,NULL,NULL

An intense bloom of coccolithophores <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> was observed in 2005–2006 when the nitrogen in marine water declined and the N/P ratio dropped below the Redfield proportion. In the 2007–2008, N/P ratio increased above the Redfield stoichiometry leading to the domination of the diatoms in phytoplankton community. The predominance of <i>E. huxleyi</i> was observed again in 2009–2010 and again it was associated with the decrease of the N/P ratio. To confirm the observation correlation between community composition and the mineral nutrient concentrations we undertook laboratory microcosm studies with addition of various amounts of a nitrogen and phosphorus sources to marine water. It was found that decreased nitrogen level and respective lower N/P stoichiometric ratio were essential precondition for coccolithophores domination.

This is the first phylogeny of the taxon to employ concatenated sequences of several genes, and it includes more than twice as many species as the last published molecular phylogeny of the entire group nearly a decade ago. Most of the numerous molecular phylogenies published during the last 15 years are limited to rather small fractions of its species diversity. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses are mostly congruent and confirm the presence of three previously reported highly divergent lineages among cone snails, and one identified here using molecular data. About 85% of the species cluster in the single Large Major Clade; the others are divided between the Small Major Clade (∼12%), the <i>Conus californicus</i> lineage (one species), and a newly defined clade (∼3%). We also define several subclades within the Large and Small major clades, but most of their relationships remain poorly supported. To illustrate the usefulness of molecular phylogenies in addressing specific evolutionary questions, we analyse the evolution of the diet, the biogeography and the toxins of cone snails. All cone snails whose feeding biology is known inject venom into large prey animals and swallow them whole. Predation on polychaete worms is inferred as the ancestral state, and diet shifts to molluscs and fishes occurred rarely. The ancestor of cone snails probably originated from the Indo-Pacific; rather few colonisations of other biogeographic provinces have probably occurred.

More precisely this study focused on unraveling the observed pattern of intertidal benthic fauna composition and diversity observed at among-site scale by exploring both biotic and abiotic factors acting at the among- and within-site scales. Results showed a limited level of similarity at the among-site level in terms of intertidal benthic fauna composition and diversity. The observed pattern did not fit with existing transitional water classification methods based on fish or benthic assemblages developed in the frame of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). More particularly, the coastal plain estuaries displayed higher among-site similarity compared to ria systems. These coastal plain estuaries were characterized by higher influence of river discharge, lower communication with the ocean and high suspended particulate matter levels. On the other hand, the ria-type systems were more dissimilar and different from the coastal plain estuaries. The level of similarity among estuaries was mainly linked to the relative extent of the intertidal “<i>Scrobicularia plana–Cerastoderma edule</i>” and “<i>Tellina tenuis</i>” or “<i>Venus</i>” communities as a possible consequence of salinity regime, suspended matter concentrations and fine particles supply with consequences on the trophic functioning, structure and organization of benthic fauna.

Moreover, the area swept by otter trawls is dynamic both between and within tows; capture of fauna associated with seagrass can be strongly influenced by gear-induced turbulence, and animals are able to escape under the net that often rides on top of the SAV. We compared catch from the commonly-used otter trawl with that from the rollerframe trawl, which has not been previously evaluated for fishery-independent research purposes. We found that the rollerframe trawls had higher catch rates and caught more species of fauna in seagrass beds across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Among the species captured, 72% were more abundant in the rollerframe trawls compared to 11% more abundant in otter trawls (17% of species were captured at equal abundances). These results were consistent across sites and for a wide range of taxa. Additionally, the rollerframe trawls captured 25% more species than the otter trawls. Our findings suggest that rollerframe trawls generally have a higher capture efficiency than otter trawls in seagrass beds. We therefore recommend that the rollerframe trawl be used as an alternative or supplemental gear for ecologists and fisheries scientists working in seagrass beds.","Stallings, C.D.; Brower, J.P.; Heinlein Loch, J.M.; Mickle, A.",WOS:000336348400019,"Stallings, Christopher, C.D.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2014.03.002,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Active sampling; Field experiment; Gear comparison; Otter trawl; Rollerframe trawl; Submerged aquatic vegetation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Adult individuals have never been reported before in the Mediterranean Sea, where only seven juvenile specimens were found in 1975 at 500 m water depth in the Central basin (Malta). The affinities of these specimens with <i>D. antirrhinum</i> were noted, but lack of some typical characters of the species in juveniles prevented a definite taxonomical identification.

We also observed 5 individuals of this species on their natural habitat with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Our results highlight the potential occurrence of Octacnemidae, the presence of which has been largely overlooked, in several deep-sea canyon areas within the Western Mediterranean basin.

Diagnostic morphological characters are often missing or are obscured by the variation in sclerite forms. Consequently, species are difficult to assign to genera. In this study the current genera and their taxonomic positions are reviewed and reassessed based on material collected from the Indo-Pacific, Red Sea and Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa. Molecular data were obtained for four different loci, both mitochondrial (COI, mtMutS, ND6) and nuclear (28S rDNA). Combining the molecular and morphological data revealed that all former genera, except for the monotypic genus <i>Asperaxis</i> and the genus <i>Wrightella</i> are paraphyletic. Molecular data for the two subfamilies (Asperaxinae and Melithaeinae) within the Melithaeidae, in comparison with the outgroup, indicated that the family is also paraphyletic. Furthermore we observed that species did not cluster according to their present morphological classification but instead clustered according to a biogeographical pattern. Species from the Red Sea, Indian Ocean and Central Pacific, respectively, grouped into well supported clades. Consequently, we did not find morphological- or phylogenetic support to maintain the generic names <i>Acabaria</i>, <i>Clathraria</i>, <i>Mopsella</i> and <i>Wrightella</i>.

Community structure is determined by a complex interaction between the physiological characteristics of each species, environmental conditions, resource availability, competition among species, and numerous loss terms. This complexity makes it very difficult to predict how changes in environmental conditions will alter the structure of phytoplankton communities. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with variable selection to identify how temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations determine the abundance of the 67 dominant identified species at Station CARIACO in the Caribbean Sea. This approach allows us to overcome the statistical challenge presented by the highly correlated environmental variables. Approximately three-quarters of the variables for each species have little effect on phytoplankton abundance. About half of the species decline in abundance with increasing temperature.

Neither were there significant differences in assemblage metrics or composition between the marginal and non-edge regions of either habitat.

We present a comprehensive overview of diversity and phylogeny as they have figured into the evolution of the Asteroidea from Paleozoic to the living fauna. Living post-Paleozoic asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically separate from those in the Paleozoic. Early Paleozoic asteroid faunas were diverse and displayed morphology that foreshadowed later living taxa. Preservation presents significant difficulties, but fossil occurrence and current accounts suggests a diverse Paleozoic fauna, which underwent extinction around the Permian-Triassic interval was followed by re-diversification of at least one surviving lineage. Ongoing phylogenetic classification debates include the status of the Paxillosida and the Concentricycloidea. Fossil and molecular evidence has been and continues to be part of the ongoing evolution of asteroid phylogenetic research. The modern lineages of asteroids include the Valvatacea, the Forcipulatacea, the Spinlosida, and the Velatida. We present an overview of diversity in these taxa, as well as brief notes on broader significance, ecology, and functional morphology of each. Although much asteroid taxonomy is stable, many new taxa remain to be discovered with many new species currently awaiting description. The Goniasteridae is currently one of the most diverse families within the Asteroidea.

Monitoring the status of marine environments is traditionally based on macrofauna surveys, for which standardised methods have been established. Benthic foraminifera are also good indicators of environmental status because of their fast turnover rates, high degree of specialisation, and the preservation of dead assemblages in the fossil record. In spite of the growing interest in foraminiferal bio-monitoring during the last decades, no standardised methodology has been proposed until today. The aim of the FOraminiferal BIo-MOnitoring (FOBIMO) expert workshop, held in June 2011 at Fribourg, Switzerland, which assembled 37 scientists from 24 research groups and 13 countries, was to develop a suite of standard methods. This paper presents the main outcome of the workshop, a list of motivated recommendations with respect to sampling devices, sample storage, treatment, faunal analysis and documentation. Our recommendations fulfil the criteria imposed both by scientific rigour and by the practical limitations of routine studies. Hence, our aim is to standardise methodologies used in bio-monitoring only and not to limit the use of different methods in pure scientific studies. Unless otherwise stated, all recommendations concern living (stained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages. We have chosen to propose two types of recommendations. Mandatory recommendations have to be followed if a study wants to qualify as sound and compatible to the norms. The most important of these recommendations are the interval from 0 to 1 cm below the sediment surface has to be sampled, and an interface corer or box corer that keeps the sediment surface intact is to be used for offshore surveys. A grab sampler must not be deployed in soft sediments. Three replicate samples are to be taken and analysed separately. Samples are to be washed on a 63-μm screen, and the living benthic foraminiferal fauna of the > 125 μm fraction is to be analysed. Splits are to be picked and counted entirely, and all counted foraminifera from at least one replicate per station have to be stored in micropalaeontological slides. Census data, supplementary laboratory data and microslides have to be archived. Advisory recommendations are to sample in autumn, to have a sample size of 50 cm2 or a tube of 8 cm inner diameter, to use > 70% ethanol as a preservative, rose Bengal at a concentration of 2 grams per litre for staining, and a staining time of at least 14 days. The split size should be defined by a target value of 300 specimens, heavy liquid separation should be avoided, and the 63–125 μm fraction or deeper sediment levels may be considered in some environments. We are convinced that the application of this protocol by a large number of scientists is a necessary first step to a general acceptance of benthic foraminifera as a reliable tool in bio-monitoring studies.","Schönfeld, J.; Alve, E.; Geslin, E.; Jorissen, F.; Korsun, S.; Spezzaferri, S.; FOBIMO group",WOS:000308904800001,"Jorissen, Frans, F.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2012.06.001,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Foraminifera,NULL,NULL,    Benthic foraminifera; Assemblage analysis; Sampling; Processing; Monitoring; Conservation biology,Journal article,NULL,NULL

With appropriate conversion factors, numerical species abundance can be expressed as biovolume and then converted to phytoplankton carbon. To-date there has been no attempt to analyze globally distributed phytoplankton data sets to determine the most appropriate species-specific mean cell volume. We have determined phytoplankton cell volumes for 214 of the most common species found in globally distributed coastal time series. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large diatoms is 200,000, 20,000 and 0.1 times respectively, compared to small diatoms. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large dinoflagellates is 1500, 1000 and 0.7 times respectively, compared to small dinoflagellates. The range in diatom biovolumes is 100 times greater than across dinoflagellates (i.e. >200,000 vs. 1500 times) and within any diatom species, the range in biovolume is up to 10-fold. Variation in diatom cell volumes are the single largest source of uncertainty in community phytoplankton carbon estimates and greatly exceeds the uncertainty associated with the different volume to carbon estimates. Small diatoms have 10 times more carbon density than large diatoms and small dinoflagellates have 1.5 times more carbon density than large cells. However, carbon density varies relatively little compared to biovolume. We recommend that monthly biovolumes should be determined on field samples, at least for the most important species in each study area, since these measurements will incorporate the effects of variations in light, temperature, nutrients and life cycles. Since biovolumes of diatoms are particularly variable, the use of size classes will help to capture the percentage of large and small cells for each species at certain times of the year. This summary of global datasets of phytoplankton biovolumes is useful in order to evaluate where locally determined biovolumes lie within the global spectrum of spatial and temporal variations and may be used as a species cell volume reference where no locally determined volume estimates are available. There is a need to adopt standard protocols for measuring biovolumes and documenting the accompanying metadata which would improve inter-comparability among time series data sets.","Harrison, P.J.; Zingone, A.; Mickelson, M.J.; Lehtinen, S.; Ramaiah, N.; Kraberg, A.C.; Sun, J.; McQuatters-Gollop, A.; Jakobsen, H.H.",WOS:000360774700014,"McQuatters-Gollop, Abigail, A.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2015.05.026,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,"Bacillariophyceae, ""Dinoflagellata""",NULL,NULL,    phytoplankton cell volume; cell carbon; diatoms; dinoflagellates; carbon biomass; biovolume,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Therefore, examinations of spatial variations in benthic assemblages require background knowledge of the environmental and biotic heterogeneity of habitats in order to understand ecological processes in such areas. The effect of habitat-related abiotic and biological variables on macrofaunal benthic assemblages was studied seasonally in 2010 and 2011 in the brackish, semi-enclosed Puck Lagoon (Gulf of Gdańsk, southern Baltic Sea). Based on macrophytal biomass, two discrete benthic regions were identified in the lagoon: a region of large biomass and a region of few macrophytes. The quality of the surface sediment organic matter (measured as C/Nsed ratio), depth, and benthic macrophyte composition accounted for within-region variation, which led to the identification of four habitats. Shallow sandy sediments with low C/Nsed ratios provide high quality sedimentary food for animals that, together with species-rich, dense macrophyte vegetation, support diverse assemblages. High C/Nsed ratios and peat outcrops in shallow sands exert a negative effect on macrofaunal diversity. Two deeper sandy habitats with less massive, species-poor vegetation tend to host distinct faunal assemblages of higher abundance and biomass. The importance of benthic vegetation for macrofaunal assemblages in the southern Baltic Sea is suggested to stem from its complex spatial structure that offers a number of microniches for infaunal and epifaunal species. The effect of macrophytes on benthic faunal assemblages was consistent throughout most of the year with the strongest influence in summer when macrophytes reached the highest biomass.","Sokolowski, A.; Ziolkowska, M.; Zgrundo, A.",WOS:000361160600010,"Zgrundo, Aleksandra, A.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.017,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Benthic habitats; Faunal assemblages; Brackish low-diversity system; Southern Baltic Sea,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The results of our study of the perforated marine shells and mammal teeth suggest that the ornamental objects were not grave goods, but rather were simply artifacts present in the occupation layers in this part of the cave. The materials used to make ornaments were gathered by collecting shells along the Late Glacial shore and by hunting ungulates. The perforation techniques used were similar to those found at contemporary sites in the Franco-Cantabrian region and the appearance of various elements from the manufacturing operatory chain indicates that some of the ornaments were made at the site. It was also possible to determine that some of the shells were used—probably suspended or attached to other objects.

Phytoplankton inhabiting the near shore continental area of the Kara Sea exhibited four phases in the annual succession cycle: a prevernal phase (cryoflora bloom), a vernal phase (ice–edge bloom), a summer–fall phase (mixed synthesis phase), and a winter phase (dormant phase). These phases were clearly differentiated based on the composition of dominant phytoplankton species complexes and quantitative characteristics (i.e., microalgal number and biomass). In the study region, which is completely covered by ice for most of the year (from October to June), the process of primary production begins at the same time as in ice-free coastal areas. Sub-ice blooming and growth of cryoflora initiate beneath the ice cover, long before it breaks down. In addition, from July to October, high phytoplankton biomass was recorded in Ob Bay and in areas adjacent to the Ob-Yenisei shallows. This information provides quantitative evidence for the higher productivity of waters off the Obestuary, compared to other coastal areas in the Kara Sea.

While annelids prevailed in the subtidal area compared into intertidal, mollusk and arthropod species prevailed in the intertidal. Among 17 regions across the west coast of Korea, the Incheon exhibited the largest number of macrobenthic animals (<i>n</i> = 272) followed by the Jeonjupo where 173 species have been reported over the past 30 years. More than half of all species compiled are reported from one region only while certain opportunistic polychaetes e.g. <i>Heteromastus filiformis</i> widely distributed across the coast.

In the western Mediterranean lower slope an accumulation of biomass, but not diversity, at depths of 1200–1350 m has been observed. However, the precise causes of this biomass peak are unknown. We examined the patterns of megafauna benthic biomass in the Catalan sea open slope, from 900 to 1750 m depth, expanding the results in the context of the whole continental margin. Sampling was carried out by combining an Otter-Trawl Maireta System (OTMS) and an Agassiz trawl, during four different seasons in 2008/2009. At the same time, current speed, temperature and salinity were obtained year-round by means of near-bottom deployed sensors (current meters and temperature-conductivity sensors). Total biomass followed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at depths of 1050–1350 m. Range-related ecological forcings between shallower and deeper species may have caused this biomass accumulation at intermediate slope depths. We also report on the seasonal variations of biomass in the studied depth range, identifying a dynamic zone above 1000 m depth where populations of highly mobile species perform year-round migrations throughout the slope, and a more static region below 1000 m (i.e. the twilight zone end) with substantially less inter-annual variations. The arrival of new Western Mediterranean Deep Water from the deep basin to the lower slope in March–May may have driven the accumulation of biomass at 900 and 1050 m depth over the same period. In addition, an adjacent submarine canyon was sampled with the same procedures to characterize its benthic megafauna community. Analyses revealed higher diversity, but not biomass, inside the canyon than in the adjacent open slope, and a significantly different assemblage composition between the two habitats. These results strengthen the concept of submarine canyons as hotspots of biodiversity and underline the importance of their conservation as diversity repositories.","Tecchio, S.; Ramírez Llodra, E.; Aguzzi, J.; Sanchez-Vidal, A.; Flexas, M.; Sardá, F.; Company, J.B.",WOS:000329267400014,"Tecchio, Samuele, S.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.07.015,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

To overcome this we examine using higher taxonomic level data with M-AMBI.    Before applying such approaches to assessing ES in new geographical regions it is essential to determine the effects of using higher taxonomic level data on M-AMBI in areas where the tool was developed. To this end, we use macrofaunal data from three well studied sites in north-western Europe to examine the effects of using taxonomic level data higher than species on M-AMBI. Using the European datasets M-AMBI ES classification was shown to be robust to changes in taxonomic level data. We test the suitability of family-level M-AMBI for assessing ES in subtropical Hong Kong waters.

It remains to be rigorously evaluated, however, how to distinguish between sources of LD disagreement. In addition, death assemblages (DAs) also preserve important information on regional diversity which is not available from single censuses of the life assemblages (LAs). The northern Adriatic Sea is an ecosystem under anthropogenic pressure, and we studied the distribution and abundance of living and dead bivalve and gastropod species in the physically stressful environments (tidal flat and shallow sublittoral soft bottoms) associated with the delta of the Isonzo River (Gulf of Trieste). Specifically we evaluated the fidelity of richness, evenness, abundance, habitat discrimination and beta diversity. A total of 10,740 molluscs from fifteen tidal flat and fourteen sublittoral sites were analyzed for species composition and distribution of living and dead molluscs. Of 78 recorded species, only eleven were numerically abundant. There were many more dead than living individuals and rarefied species richness in the DA was higher at all spatial scales, but the differences are lower in habitats and in the region than at individual stations. Evenness was always higher in death assemblages, and probably due to temporally more variable LAs the differences are stronger in the sublittoral habitats. Distinct assemblages characterized intertidal and sublittoral habitats, and the distribution and abundance of empty shells generally corresponded to that of the living species. Death assemblages have lower beta diversity than life assemblages, but empty shells capture compositional differences between habitats to a higher degree than living shells. More samples would be necessary to account for the diversity of living molluscs in the study area, which is, however, well recorded in the death assemblages. There is no indication of a major environmental change over the last decades in this area, but due to the long history of anthropogenic pressure here, such a potential impact might be preserved in historical layers of the deeper sedimentary record.","Weber, K.; Zuschin, M.",WOS:000315762100007,"Zuschin, Martin, M.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.11.021,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Recent; Mediterranean Sea; Gulf of Trieste; Diversity; Taphonomy; Paleoecology; Conservation Paleobiology,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Taxon richness and overall faunal biomass were highest at the shallowest stations, and lowest in the depressions and ice-influenced areas. The overall functioning of the faunal communities reflected the habitat type. In the trough areas, the sediment mixing depth was greatest, reflecting the bioturbatory activities of the fauna. The shallow, gravelly, erosion areas on the Spitsbergen Bank supported mostly surface-active taxa, consistent with the relatively low biological mixing depths. The mixed sediments of the slope environments supported a mixture of surface-active and bioturbating taxa. Functional trait coding offers an additional tool for mesoscale characterisation of communities, particularly for large-scale or long-term datasets, where taxonomic identifications may not be compatible.

In contrast to ahistorical systems, which are governed solely by constraints (i.e. laws), historical systems and their dynamics can be understood only if properly described, in the course of time. Describing these dynamics and understanding long-term variability can be seen as the mission of long time series measuring not only simple abiotic features but also complex biological variables, such as species diversity and abundances, allowing deep insights in the functioning of food webs and ecosystems in general. Long time-series are irreplaceable for understanding change, and crucially inherent system variability and thus envisaging future scenarios. This notwithstanding current policies in funding and evaluating scientific research discourage the maintenance of long term series, despite a clear need for long-term strategies to cope with climate change. Time series are crucial for a pursuit of the much invoked Ecosystem Approach and to the passage from simple monitoring programs of large-scale and long-term Earth observatories — thus promoting a better understanding of the causes and effects of change in ecosystems. The few ongoing long time series in European waters must be integrated and networked so as to facilitate the formation of nodes of a series of observatories which, together, should allow the long-term management of the features and characteristics of European waters. Human capacity building in this region of expertise and a stronger societal involvement are also urgently needed, since the expertise in recognizing and describing species and therefore recording them reliably in the context of time series is rapidly vanishing from the European Scientific community.","Boero, F.; Kraberg, A.C.; Krause, G.; Wiltshire, K.H.",WOS:000357908600002,"Kraberg, A.C.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2014.07.008,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Biodiversity; Citizen science; Long-term data; Taxonomy,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The shallow assemblages divide into three types of warm-water mesotrophic foraminiferal assemblages, which is not only a consequence of high primary productivity restricting light to the benthos but due to low pore water oxygenation, shelf geomorphology, and sediment partitioning. In the intermediate depth (approx. 500 m), the increase in foraminiferal diversity is due to the cold-water coral habitat providing a greater range of micro niches. Planktonic species characterise the lower bathyal zone, which emphasizes the reduced benthic carbonate production at depth. Although, due to the strong hydrodynamics within the Golf, planktonic species occur in notable abundances through out the whole depth gradient.

Here, we identified sites in Brazilian waters that would maximize species representation and avoid potential conflicts with relevant economic activities. We compared conservation benefits provided by three conservation-planning scenarios that incorporated the distribution of 750 marine vertebrate species, while considering established marine protected areas (MPAs) and blocks concessioned for the oil and gas industry. The results showed that a MPA network encompassing 10% of the study area with high conservation priority would cover between 85.8 and 86.5% of species distributions, on average. We found that incorporating existing MPAs and areas concessioned for oil and gas exploitation in the prioritization process caused only a small loss in representation of near-threatened and threatened species. Our results highlight, therefore, that it is possible to reconcile current offshore oil and gas production with the expansion of the national MPA network, without significant losses in species' representation.

The BAT is a multimetric methodology based on three indices, the Shannon–Wiener and Margalef diversity indices, applied in conjunction with AMBI (AZTI Marine Biotic Index). To determinate the feeding diversity, each invertebrate was assigned to a feeding group. Six trophic groups were considered: surface deposit feeders, subsurface deposit feeders, herbivores or grazers, suspension feeders and suspension/deposit feeders. The carnivorous, omnivorous and scavengers were all grouped together, forming the sixth group.    The results obtained with both tools pointed out, in general, to the same tendencies. However, in few occasions the feeding diversity pointed out to a high or a bad ecological quality condition whereas the BAT indicated a moderate condition. Occasionally, in stations with average species richness, all individuals were assigned to only one to three feeding groups, and the feeding diversity was low. Even if these taxa were included in the first two or three AMBI sensitive groups, with their presence indicating a possible good ecological condition, they all perform the same ecological function, for example, they are all omnivorous. In these cases the trophic functioning of the system is reduced and the lower trophic levels are missing, such as the suspension-feeders and the decomposers or deposit-feeders. On the contrary, a highly diverse trophic assemblage might be found, but composed of taxa assigned to AMBI ecological groups of species indifferent or tolerant to organic enrichment, and of second-order opportunistic species, indicating a moderate ecological condition, while the feeding diversity will be high. The feeding diversity is, therefore, useful as a complementary information index, measuring other aspects of the community organization, which are not required for ecological quality assessment by the WFD, and so not included in metrics such as BAT.","Gamito, S.; Patrício, J.; Neto, J.M.; Teixeira, H.; Marques, J.C.",WOS:000302891100008,"Gamito, Sofia, S.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.08.003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Water Framework Directive (WFD); Ecological quality status; Benthic invertebrates; Trophic groups; Functional ecology; Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT),Journal article,NULL,NULL

Data are from synoptic studies carried out at four oligohaline transitional water ecosystems, from the Southern Italy and the Danube delta ecoregions; they refer to 40 macroinvertebrate taxa selected from the overall species pool according to absolute and relative density requirements. Species composition differed widely among ecoregions while length–mass relationships of the species occurring in both ecoregions did not; the variability of length–mass parameters of these species among ecosystems was lower than 10%. Length–mass regressions were relatively conservative also with respect to taxonomic resolution; significant differences were observed among species within 5 out of the 7 orders tested but differences in slopes and intercepts were on average lower than 15%. Therefore, our results, representing one of the first efforts to catalogue length–mass relationships for benthic macroinvertebrates in transitional waters, support the assumption of relative invariance of length–mass relationships and their use in studies where gross estimates of population biomasses are required.","Rosati, I.; Barbone, E.; Basset, A.",WOS:000311066800023,"Rosati, I.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.08.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    length–mass relationships; benthic macroinvertebrates; biomass estimate; Mediterranean Sea; Black Sea; transitional waters,Journal article,NULL,NULL

It has relatively few biases and DNA can be extracted from challenging groups, where forms are fragile, such as jellyfish, or where early life stages are difficult to connect with adult forms. The problem is that resources are finite, and the rise of one powerful method came with the demise of traditional taxonomy. In addition, genetic methods may be very sophisticated, requiring acute expertise to master its techniques. These two points in combination have resulted in less funding and attraction for traditional approaches.

Two different domains (eastern and western) can be recognized on the platform during the late Cenomanian, before the onset of the OAE2. The western domain corresponds to a low-energy environment developed on a mid and/or outer ramp with hypoxic waters, low detrital influx and low paleoproductivity. The paleoecological assemblages show limited specific diversity but variable density. The ostracods are opportunistic and unspecialized (<i>r</i> strategists), being associated with Buliminidae, surface and intermediate-water planktonic foraminifera, and fishes. The eastern domain corresponds to an inner ramp and/or peritidal environment with oxic waters, low detrital influx and low paleoproductivity, developed in a higher energy environment with paleoecological assemblages showing high diversity but variable density. The ostracods are more specialized (<i>K</i> strategists), being represented by diverse and constant assemblages associated with diversified benthic foraminifera, calcareous sponges and echinoderms, as well as intermediate- and deep-water planktonic foraminifera. The onset of the OAE2 has no influence on the western ostracod assemblages, but leads to the decline of the ostracod fauna and the disappearance of the deep-water planktonic foraminifera in the eastern domain. During the early Turonian, after the OAE2, the platform becomes an outer ramp with increased paleoproductivity, but is associated with a decrease of taxonomic diversity in hypoxic waters. The ostracods are very sparse and unspecialized, associated with siliceous sponges, Buliminidae, surface-living planktonic foraminifera, fishes and pelagic crinoids.

Sea-ice ecosystems are unique from a global warming perspective as increasing temperature will result in the reduction of actual habitat substrate in addition to the air and water warming that will affect most other ecosystems. Over the next century sea-ice declines are predicted to range from 3–67% in the northern hemisphere and 8–64% in the southern hemisphere. We assembled meta-ecosystem food webs for Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice ecosystems for terrestrial and marine species that are dependent on the sea-ice to compare their topological structure and structural robustness to species loss. While the Arctic and Antarctic webs generally showed similar topology, a number of differences between the webs were identified including higher trophic species richness in the Antarctic, a right shifted trophic position distribution, and greater generality. Arctic webs had higher looping, clustering, and diet discontinuity suggesting the presence of stronger sub-webs and compartmentalization. Both the Arctic and Antarctic webs showed low robustness to the loss of low trophic position species and highly connected species, with 50% species loss occurring after the removal of ∼8% of species. The Arctic web was 33% less robust to deletions when ordered from lowest to highest trophic position than the Antarctic web. Our results suggest that food webs in the Arctic webs may be more sensitive to species loss as might occur due to sea-ice declines than Antarctic food webs.","Carscallen, W.M.A.; Romanuk, T.N.",WOS:000309374600021,"Carscallen, W.

We surveyed the epibenthic megafaunal assemblages of Marian Cove, a representative fjord on King George Island. We collected specimens by SCUBA diving at varying distances from the retreating glacier front during the 2013/2014 austral summer. Based on presence/absence data from the collected taxa, we determined species richness (S), taxonomic distinctness (TD) and functional diversity (FD) and further analyzed differences in assemblages in relation to environmental characteristics. Faunal assemblages in the inner cove (ice-proximal zone) were compositionally distinct from those in the outer cove. Species number and FD were also lower in the inner cove and tended to increase toward the outer cove. Nonetheless, TD values were similar among sites, indicating that all sites were distinct taxonomically. This may be because glacier retreat affected organisms of lower taxonomic levels the most. Multivariate and univariate analyses demonstrated that these differences were significantly related to distance from the glacier, substrate grain size, and organic content. The high correlation (R = 0.909, P < 0.01) of assemblages with distance from the glacier front suggests that physical disturbance by ice is a major process shaping benthic communities. Thus, we provide evidence that glacier retreat and its consequent processes impact the structure and function of communities. With their spatial pattern significantly associated with environmental suites, nearshore megabenthic communities respond sensitively and measurably to climate-induced impacts, suggesting their utility as long-term biomonitors. As a small but confined glacial cove with very distinct environmental gradients related to climate-induced processes, Marian Cove could serve as a model ecosystem for assessing climate impacts on Antarctic nearshore benthic communities.","Moon, H.-W.; Hussin, W.M.R.W.; Kim, H.-C.; Ahn, I.-Y.",WOS:000358091800033,"Moon, Hye-Won, H.-W.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.04.031,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Antarctic; Climate impact; Diversity; Glacier retreat; Marian Cove; Marine benthic community; Spatial variation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Three horizons were dated using <sup>14</sup>C. The sedimentological, palaeontological and geochemical interpretations of the lagoonal sediments reveal three major lithological units deposited between around 5200 and 1600 BP. The upper lithological unit extended to a depth of 11.20 m, the middle from 11.20 to 21.30 m, and the lower one from 21.30 to 30.00 m. A mean rate of sedimentation of 5.7 mm/y and a maximum rate of 12.6 mm/y were estimated. The mineralogical analysis and the magnetic susceptibility of the core points to a constant sediment – source supply. The Mid- to Late Holocene depositional environment mainly reflects inundation by the braid plain of the Arachthos and secondarily by the Louros River. The reconstruction of the depositional environments corresponds to a shallow marine and deltaic brackish lagoon and specifically to an environment proximal to river supply. The high rates of sedimentation, as well as the interpretation of depositional environments, indicate that the coastal sedimentological processes during the Mid- to Late Holocene were mainly controlled by the progradation of river deltas. Moreover, the geochemical proxies, the recovered molluscs and the microfauna, as well as the organic petrography analyses indicate periods of dysoxic and hypoxic conditions. These Holocene dysoxic and hypoxic events indicate that the recent dystrophic crises in the Amvrakikos Gulf are not only the result of human activities but also the contribution of natural processes.","Avramidis, P.; Iliopoulos, G.; Panagiotaras, D.; Papoulis, D.; Lambropoulou, P.; Kontopoulos, N.; Siavalas, G.; Christanis, K.",WOS:000335910700002,"Avramidis, P.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quaint.2013.09.006,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This has changed only recently, at the end of 2011, with the onset of a new wet phase that has already caused a major shift to oligo- and mesohaline conditions. The estuary mouth, however, remains closed to the ocean, making the weak connection recently established between the St Lucia and the Mfolozi estuaries the only conveyance for marine recruitment. As a result, only 10 indigenous and two alien aquatic gastropod species are currently found living in the St Lucia estuarine lake. This is out of a total of 37 species recorded within the system since the earliest survey undertaken in 1924, half of which have not been reported in the literature before. The tick shell, <i>Nassarius kraussianus</i>, which was consistently found in large abundance prior to the recent dry phase, appears to have temporarily disappeared from the system, probably as a result of the extinction of <i>Zostera</i> marine grasses inside the lake. Population explosions of the bubble shell <i>Haminoea natalensis</i>, with its distinct egg masses, were recorded seasonally until 2009, but the species has subsequently not been observed again. A molecular DNA analysis of the various populations previously reported as belonging to the same assimineid species, variably referred to as <i>Assiminea capensis</i>, <i>A. ovata</i>, or <i>A. bifasciata</i>, has revealed that the St Lucia assemblage actually comprises two very distinct taxa, <i>A.</i> cf. <i>capensis</i> and a species provisionally referred to here as “<i>A.</i>” aff. <i>capensis</i> or simply Assimineidae sp.

A total of 52 species are currently recognised based on the conventional morphological species concept; however, the true diversity in the genus is masked by cryptic speciation. The considerable diversity within <i>Echinorhynchus</i> is an argument for subdividing the genus if monophyletic groups with supporting morphological characters can be identified. With this objective in mind, partial sequences of two genes with different rates of evolution and patterns of inheritance (nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among eight taxa of <i>Echinorhynchus</i>. These included representatives of each of three genus group taxa proposed in a controversial revision of the genus based on cement gland pattern, namely <i>Echinorhynchus</i> (<i>sensu stricto</i>), <i>Metechinorhynchus</i> Petrochenko, 1956 and <i>Pseudoechinorhynchus</i> Petrochenko, 1956. These groupings have previously been rejected by some authorities, because the diagnostic character is poorly defined; this study shows that <i>Echinorhynchus</i> (<i>sensu stricto</i>) and <i>Metechinorhynchus</i> are not natural, monophyletic groups. A revision of <i>Echinorhynchus</i> will require tandem molecular phylogenetic and morphological analyses of a larger sample of taxa, but this study has identified two morhological characters that might potentially be used to define new genera. The estimated phylogeny also provides insight into the zoogeographical history of <i>Echinorhynchus</i> spp. We postulate that the ancestral <i>Echinorhynchus</i> had a freshwater origin and the genus subsequently invaded the sea, probably several times.

We aimed to examine how collaboration between countries of the Mediterranean Sea affects conservation plans when costs and threats are considered.  Location    The Mediterranean Sea.  Methods    We compared three collaboration scenarios to test the efficiencies of coordinated marine conservation efforts: full coordination between Mediterranean countries, partial coordination within continents and no coordination where countries act in isolation. To do so, we developed four basin-wide surrogates for commercial and recreational fishing effort in the Mediterranean Sea. Using a systematic decision support tool (Marxan), we minimized the opportunity costs while meeting a suite of biodiversity targets.

We use this pattern as well as the age distribution of genera to predict the time of extinction of extant genera of benthic marine molluscs.LocationA global occurrence database (Paleobiology Database) of fossil marine molluscs from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras was used for this study.MethodsFor the geographical range method, we determined the average trajectories of geographical range size for extinct genera of bivalves and gastropods. The maxima of these trajectories were used as landmarks for predicting the time of extinction for extant genera. Prediction was done by cross-multiplication, using the time elapsed until the maximum was reached and the position of the landmark. For the duration–frequency method, we calculated the time of extinction based on probabilities derived from the frequency distribution of stratigraphic ranges (durations) of all extinct genera. The accuracy and precision of predictions were tested with extinct genera and then applied to extant genera.ResultsOn average, bivalve and gastropod extinct genera reached their maximum geographical range size at 62% and 50% of their total duration. The accuracy of predictions ranged from −3.1 to 11.0 million years (Myr) for both groups, and the precision ranged from 13.6 to 19.5 Myr. Only a small subset of extant genera was suitable for prediction with the geographical range method, mainly because the geographical ranges of most extant genera are still rising on geological time-scales. The second method provided a similar prediction quality, but showed a substantial decrease in quality when predicting long-duration (> 100 Myr) genera.Main conclusionsThe mean probability for an accurate prediction using the geographical range approach is 57% with a precision of ± 15 Myr. Prediction is possible only for genera whose peak geographical range has already elapsed (17% of extant bivalves, 16% of extant gastropods). The duration–frequency approach does not have this prerequisite and is therefore applicable to many more genera, but prediction quality declines with duration. The two methods therefore complement each other and can supplement the various efforts used to estimate extinction risk.","Tietje, M.; Kiessling, W.",WOS:000316325500015,"Tietje, Melanie, M.","Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.12030,NULL,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Mollusca,NULL,NULL,    Cenozoic;extinction;geographical range;marine biogeography;marine molluscs;Mesozoic;prediction,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Fishery management measures in this area include a trawling period of 8 months per year (October to May). Macrofauna samples were collected before and after 30 and 120 days of the commencement of the trawling period (temporal axis) along a southward transect (spatial axis) and down through the sediment profile (vertical axis).ResultsMain results revealed no recognizable changes in community diversity and structure at temporal scales. This finding can probably be attributed to the fact that the examined communities are subjected to continuous disturbances deriving from multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors acting simultaneously in Thermaikos Gulf. Molluscan assemblages were already stressed before the commencement of the trawling period, indicating that the time period in which bottom trawling is prohibited is not sufficient for the recovery of benthic communities. Significant shifts in the trophic structure of molluscan assemblages were also detected. The direct mortality of herbivorous species and the loss of filter feeding organisms may be attributed to the passage of the fishing gear and to sediment re-suspension, respectively. Trawling disturbance may have created the observed vertical patterns of the community structure since hauling induces profound changes in the geochemical profile of the sediment.ConclusionsOur findings sustained the notion that bottom trawling, alongside with other types of human induced stressors, can have considerable effects on the structure and function of the benthic domain. Therefore, our results highlighted the need of an Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) perspective in Thermaikos Gulf to ensure both fisheries and ecosystem sustainability.","Dimitriadis, C.; Koutsoubas, D.; Garyfalou, Z.; Tselepides, A.",WOS:000342787700001,"Dimitriadis, Charalampos, C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/2241-5793-21-10,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Bottom trawling Sediment profile Thermaikos gulf Macrofauna,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Equipment used includes underwater video, box corer, grab, epibenthic sled and beam trawl. Habitat maps are produced by combining information on landscapes, landscape elements, sediment types and biological communities. Video observations provide information about the megafauna diversity of large (>1 cm) epifauna and bottom types, whilst bottom samples describe the composition of epifauna, hyperfauna (crustaceans living in the upper part of the sediment and/or swimming just above the substratum) and infauna, and sediment composition. In this study, two biological data sets are used to study fauna response to environmental heterogeneity at two different spatial scales: (1) broad scale, megahabitat (1–10s km), based on information about megafauna taxa observed during video surveys in the Nordland/Troms area, (2) fine scale, mesohabitat (10s m−1 km), based on information about species composition documented with video records and bottom sampling gear from the bank “Tromsøflaket”. In general, the highest diversity is found on bottoms with mixed substrates indicating that substratum heterogeneity is very important for the biodiversity at both scales. The number of taxa shows a maximum at depths between 200 and 700 m followed by a gradual decrease down to 2,200 m. At the broad scale, multibeam data provides a variety of terrain variables that indicate environmental variation (e.g. exposure to currents, interpreted substrates). This analysis identifies six fauna groups associated to specific landscape elements. Diversity of megafauna shows a strong correlation with number of bottom types occurring along video transects. It is highest at the shelf break and decreased with depth on the slope in parallel with a decrease in habitat heterogeneity and temperature. At a fine scale, six biotopes are identified based on megafauna composition with habitat characteristics ranging from homogenous muddy bottom, biotope 1, to the most heterogeneous bottom with >20% rocks and several bottom types present in biotope 6. The macrofauna sampled is used for description of the whole benthic community, including diversity, biomass and production, related to these six biotopes.

Generally, current MPAs have not been established in high impact areas despite their being close to shores containing intense human activity. Decision-makers wishing to design and establish new MPAs may seek out areas of high cumulative human impacts (near the marine–terrestrial interface) or avoid them depending on marine conservation objectives, including the desire to vary types of MPAs within a network. Limitations of our analysis and methodology indicate areas for further research.","Portman, M.E.; Nathan, D.; Levin, N.",WOS:000309865300002,"Portman, Michelle, M.E.","Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13280-012-0298-x,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Marine protected areasMediterraneanProtection levelsSpatial distributionHuman activityHuman impacts,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Yet no comprehensive study was ever carried out on these organisms in European coastal waters. Thus, the aims of this study were to: investigate the diversity of teredinids in European coastal waters; map their past and recent distributions to detect range expansion or contraction; determine salinity-temperature (S-T) requirements of species; flag, for future monitoring, the species that pose the greatest hazard for wooden structures. Results: A total of nine teredinid species were found established in European coastal waters. Seven were considered cryptogenic, of unknown origin, and two were considered alien species. Teredo navalis and Nototeredo norvagica were the species with the widest distribution in European waters. Recently, T. navalis has been reported occurring further east in the Baltic Sea but it was not found at a number of sites on the Atlantic coast of southern Europe. The Atlantic lineage of Lyrodus pedicellatus was the dominant teredinid in the southern Atlantic coast of Europe. In the Mediterranean six teredinid species occurred in sympatry, whereas only three of these occurred in the Black Sea. The species that pose the greatest hazard to wooden maritime structures in European coastal areas are T. navalis and the two lineages of L. pedicellatus. Conclusions: Combined data from field surveys and from the literature made it possible to determine the diversity of established teredinid species and their past and recent distribution in Europe. The environmental requirements of species, determined using climatic envelopes, produced valuable information that assisted on the explanation of species distribution. In addition, the observed trends of species range extension or contraction in Teredo navalis and in the two lineages of Lyrodus pedicellatus seem to emphasise the importance of temperature and salinity as determinants of the distribution of teredinids, whereas their life history strategy seems to play an important role on competition. Teredo navalis and pedicellatus-like Lyrodus species should be monitored due to their destructive capability. The two alien species may expand further their distribution range in Europe, becoming invasive, and should also be monitored.","Borges, L.M.S.; Merckelbach, L.M.; Sampaio, I.; Cragg, S.M.",WOS:000332042500001,"Borges, Luísa, L.M.S.","Univ Portsmouth, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Marine Sci, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/1742-9994-11-13,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Teredinids; Shipworms; Sea surface temperature; Sea surface salinity;Life history; European coastal waters,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The Arctic is notably affected by reduced quality and quantity of sea ice caused by global warming, and by concomitant and forecasted changes in ocean productivity, species ecology, and human activity. The Atlantic has been especially impacted by severe overfishing and human-induced alterations to food webs. Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have all affected, to varying degrees, biodiversity on Canada’s Pacific coast. Past and projected trends in key biodiversity stressors reveal marked change. Oceanographic trends include increasing surface water temperatures, reduced salinity, increased acidity, and, in some areas, reduced oxygen. Reductions in Canada’s fishery catches (those in 2009 were half those of the late 1980s), followed by reductions in fishing pressure, are associated with dramatic changes in the species composition of commercial catches in the Atlantic (formerly groundfish, now predominantly invertebrates and pelagic fish) and the Pacific (formerly salmon, now predominantly groundfish). Aquaculture, dominated by the farming of Atlantic salmon, grew rapidly from the early 1980s until 2002 and has since stabilized. Climate change is forecast to affect marine biodiversity by shifting species distributions, changing species community composition, decoupling the timing of species’ resource requirements and resource availability, and reducing habitat quality. Harvest-related reductions in fish abundance, many by 80% or more, coupled with fishing-induced changes to food webs, are impairing the capacity of species to recover or even persist. Open-sea aquaculture net pens affect biodiversity by (i) habitat alteration resulting from organic wastes, chemical inputs, and use of nonnative species; (ii) exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild species; and (iii) interbreeding between wild fish and farmed escapees. Physical and biological changes in the oceans, along with direct anthropogenic impacts, are modifying Canadian marine biodiversity with implications for food security and the social and economic well-being of coastal communities. To assess the consequences of changes in biodiversity for Canada’s oceans and society, it is necessary to understand the current state of marine biodiversity and how it might be affected by projected changes in climate and human uses.","Hutchings, J.A.; Côté, I.M.; Dodson, J.J.; Fleming, I.A.; Jennings, S.; Mantua, N.J.; Peterman, R.M.; Riddell, B.E.; Weaver, A.J.",WOS:000312499400002,"Mantua, Nathan, N.J.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1139/a2012-011,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Pisces,NULL,NULL,"ocean, fish, overfishing, fish farming, Canada",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Among the most important questions are: which are the most vulnerable organisms to climate warming and where are they? Recently, there has been debate on whether the tropics or temperate zones are more vulnerable to warming. Vulnerability toward higher temperatures will depend on the organisms’ thermal limits and also on their acclimation capacity, which remains largely unknown for most species. The aim of the present work was to estimate (1) the upper thermal limits (Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax)), (2) the warming tolerance (CTMax – Maximum Habitat Temperature) and (3) the acclimation capacity of tropical and temperate rocky shore organisms. Differences in biological groups (decapod crustaceans vs fish) were investigated and the effect of region (tropical vs temperate) and habitat (intertidal vs subtidal) was tested. Overall, 35 species were tested. For the assessment of the acclimation capacity, tropical-temperate pairs of closely related species of shrimp, crab and fish were selected. Warming tolerance was higher for temperate species than for tropical species and higher for subtidal species than for intertidal species, confirming that species with the highest thermal limits have the lowest warming tolerance. All species tested presented some acclimation capacity (CTMaxTrial − CTMaxControl), with the exception of gobiid fish, which was not observed to acclimate. The tropical species tested showed a lower acclimation capacity than their temperate counterparts. Given that tropical rocky shore organisms are already living very close to their thermal limits and that their acclimation capacity is limited, it is likely that the impacts of global warming will be evident sooner in the tropics than in the temperate zone.","Vinagre, C.; Leal, I.; Mendonça, V.; Madeira, D.; Narciso, L.; Diniz, M.S.; Flores, A.A.V.",WOS:000370454600033,"Leal, Inês, I.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.11.010,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Global change; Warming tolerance; Upper thermal limits; Critical Thermal Maximum; Rocky shore; Intertidal,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The global distribution of Antipatharia habitat suitability shows a marked contrast with the distribution of specimen observations, indicating that many potentially suitable areas have not been sampled, and that sampling effort has been disproportionate to shallow, accessible areas inside marine protected areas (MPAs).

Abiotic stressors acting on marine systems do not act alone, rather in a combination of multiple stressors, especially in coastal habitats such as estuaries, where anthropogenic and environmental pressures are high. Arsenic (As) is a widely distributed contaminant worldwide and its toxicity has been studied on a variety of organisms. However, the effect of low pH on the toxicity of As on marine organisms is unknown. Here, we studied the combined effects of ocean acidification and As exposure on two closely related oyster species (<i>Crassostrea angulata</i> and <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>), by use of a biochemical approach. Oxidative stress related parameters were studied along with the assessment of biomineralization enzymes activity after 28 days of exposure. Results showed that both species were sensitive to all tested conditions (low pH, As and pH + As), showing enhancement of antioxidant and biotransformation defenses and impairment of biomineralization processes. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity were significantly higher in oysters exposed to As, showing activation of detoxification mechanisms, and a lower GSTs activity was observed in low pH + As condition, indicating an impact on the oysters capacity to detoxify As in a low pH scenario. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was significantly lower in all tested conditions, showing to be affected by both As and low pH, whereas the combined effect of low pH + As was not different from the effect of low pH alone. Multivariate analysis of biochemical data allowed for the comparison of both species performance, showing a clear distinction of response in both species. <i>C. gigas</i> presented overall higher enzymatic activity (GSTs; superoxide dismutase; catalase; CA and acid phosphatase) and higher cytosolic GSH content in As exposed oysters than <i>C. angulata</i>.

Using large-scale field surveys across 13 macrotidal sandy beaches of two types (exposed and semi-exposed) distributed along 2700 km of coast for 7 years (REBENT program, Brittany, France), we analysed responses of zoobenthos to the presence of green tides in relation to tidal range, exposure, sediment characteristics, air and seawater temperature, precipitations, wind and salinity. Despite the high variability existing between two distinct categories of sandy habitats and also between macrotidal beaches within the study area, differences in macrofaunal community structure arose from the presence of green tides: mean abundance and species richness of macrozoobenthic invertebrates were higher where green tides occurred. Moreover, macrobenthic assemblages in the two beach-categories respond differently to eutrophication seen as green tides. Surprisingly, the effects of the presence of Ulva mats were stronger at exposed sandy beaches than at semi-exposed beaches. Our study also highlights species-specific responses: herbivorous marine invertebrates and suspension feeders were favoured by the presence of Ulva mats, whereas large sub-surface deposit feeders and bivalve drifters which surf up and down the shore with the tides were negatively affected by green tides.","Quillien, N.; Nordström, M.C.; Guyonnet, B.; Maguer, M.; Le Garrec, V.; Bonsdorff, E.; Grall, J.",WOS:000367862400038,"Quillien, Nolwenn, N.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2015.07.042,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Ulva,NULL,NULL,    Macrotidal sandy beaches; Zoobenthos; Eutrophication; Ulva; Habitat; Space-time-environment analysis,Journal article,NULL,NULL

According to the current checklist of the Italian marine biota, 48 species of Kinorhyncha were reported up to 2008 along the Italian coastlines. However, 31 of them are considered <i>nomina dubia</i> and hence of doubtful utility. Here we point out those taxa and provide new information based on recent publications and on novel investigations carried out in selected areas of the Adriatic Sea (3 localities), Ligurian Sea (4), Tyrrhenian Sea (8), and Ionian Sea (1). New data derives from qualitative as well as from quantitative samples. The analysis of the new samples yielded 6 families, 9 genera, and 29 species, of which only 16 were previously recorded from peninsular waters. In summary, we recorded one new genus and two new species for Italy, together with 13 additional species that appear new to science. Particularly interesting is the finding of two new species belonging to rare genus <i>Condyloderes</i>, as it represents the first record of this taxon in the Mediterranean Sea. The most speciose genus is <i>Echinoderes</i>, followed by <i>Pycnophyes</i> with 10 and 8 species, respectively. The former genus includes the taxon showing the highest abundance, <i>E. capitatus</i>, with recorded densities up to 184&nbsp;ind./10&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>, while the latter includes the most common species <i>P. communis</i>, found in 7 out of the 16 new investigated localities. New faunistic information prompted the revision of the checklist, which in the new version includes 36 species in 9 genera and 6 families. Old and new data were utilized for a preliminary discussion on the geographic distribution of the recorded fauna, from which it appeared that five species only can be considered ubiquitous in the four Italian sea basins, whereas the other taxa appear to be restricted to one or two seas. However, many sectors of the Italian coastline remain unexplored. Besides those areas (e.g., mid Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts), future research should be focused on peculiar habitats, such as submarine caves, lagoons, and coarse biogenic sediments, as many species and species records come from these neglected biotopes, often representing biodiversity hotspots.","Dal Zotto, M.; Todaro, M.A.",WOS:000389109100007,"Dal Zotto, Matteo, M.","Consortium Interuniv Ctr Marine Biol & Appl Ecol, Livorno, Italy.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jcz.2016.01.004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Meiofauna; Biogeography; Taxonomy; Biodiversity; Mediterranean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Categorisation of seabed habitats for management is often based on topographic features such as canyons and seamounts that can be distinguished using regional bathymetry (‘mega-habitats’). This is practical but because such habitats are contiguous with others, there is potential for overlap in the communities associated with them. Because concepts of habitat and community vulnerability are based on the traits of individual taxa, the nature and extent of differences between communities have implications for strategies to manage the environmental effects of resource use. Using towed video camera transects, we surveyed mega-epifaunal communities of three topographically-defined habitats (canyon, seamount or knoll, and continental slope) and two physico-chemically defined meso-scale habitats (cold seep and hydrothermal vent) in two regions off New Zealand to assess whether each supports a distinct type of community. Cold seep and hydrothermal vent communities were strongly distinct from those in other habitats. Across the other habitats, however, distinctions between communities were often weak and were not consistent between regions. Dissimilarities among communities across all habitats were stronger and the density of filter-feeding taxa was higher in the Bay of Plenty than on the Hikurangi Margin, whereas densities of predatory and scavenging taxa were higher on the Hikurangi Margin. Substratum diversity at small spatial scales (<1 km) and trawl history were significantly correlated with community composition in both regions. We conclude that, (1) a lack of consistent distinction between communities raises questions about the general utility of topographically-defined mega-habitats in environmental management, (2) fine-scale survey of individual features is necessary to identify the locations, characteristics, and extents of ecologically important or vulnerable seabed communities, and (3) evaluation of habitat vulnerability to future events should be in the context of previous and current disturbances.","Bowden, D.A.; Rowden, A.A.; Leduc, D.; Beaumont, J.; Clark, M.R.",WOS:000368750900004,"Bowden, David, D.A.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Private Bag 14-901, Wellington, New Zealand.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2015.10.011,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This review deals with what is known about the kinetics, biochemical properties and applications of these enzymes that have only been found in them and not in other α-amylases, and discussing their mechanistic and regulatory implications.","Homaei, A.; Ghanbarzadeh, M.; Monsef, F.",WOS:000369200500037,"Homaei, Ahmad, A.","Hormozgan Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Bandar Abbas, Iran.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.11.080,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    a-Amylase; Marine organisms; Kinetic properties,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The total production and P/B ratio for each sector ranged from 3.8 (±7.9) to 615.6 (±635.5) kJ m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> and 0.5 (± 0.2) to 0.7 (± 0.2) yr<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The shallow shelves in the western Arctic Ocean exhibited particularly high production (178.7–615.6 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>), particularly in the two “hotspots” – the southern and northeastern (around Barrow Canyon) Chukchi Sea. Benthic macrofaunal production decreased sharply with depth and latitude along a shelf–slope–basin transect, with values of 17.0–269.8 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> in slope regions and 3.8–10.1 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> in basins. Redundancy analysis indicated that hydrological characteristics (depth, bottom temperature and salinity) and granulometric parameters (mean particle size, % sand and % clay) show significant positive/negative correlations with total production. These correlations revealed that the dominant factors influencing benthic production are the habitat type and food supply from the overlying water column. In the Arctic, the extreme environmental conditions and low temperature constrain macrofaunal metabolic processes, such that food and energy are primarily used to increase body mass rather than for reproduction. Hence, energy turnover is relatively low at high latitudes. These data further our understanding of benthic production processes and ecosystem dynamics in the context of rapid climate change in the western Arctic Ocean.","Lin, H.; Wang, J.; Liu, K.; He, X.; Lin, J.; Huang, Y.; Zhang, S.; Mou, J.; Zheng, C.; Wang, Y.",WOS:000368956700004,"Lin, Heshan, H.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.csr.2015.12.001,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Benthic macrofaunal production; Western Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Beaufort Sea; Environmental factors,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Eight fossil corals of presumably Last Interglacial age from Bonaire, southern Caribbean Sea, were investigated, and several sub-samples were dated from each coral. For four corals, both the ages and the activity ratios of the bulk material and theca wall agree within uncertainty. Three corals show significantly older ages for their bulk material than for their theca wall material as well as substantially elevated <sup>232</sup>Th content and (<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U) ratios. The bulk material samples of another coral show younger ages and lower (<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U) ratios than the corresponding theca wall samples. This coral also contains a considerable amount of <sup>232</sup>Th.    The application of the available open-system models developed to account for post-depositional diagenetic effects in corals shows that none of the models can successfully be applied to the Bonaire corals. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the assumptions of the models are not fulfilled by our data set.    Comparison of the theca wall and bulk material data enables us to obtain information about the open-system processes that affected the corals. The corals showing apparently older ages for their bulk material were probably affected by contamination with a secondary (detrital) phase. The most likely source of the detrital material is carbonate sand. The higher (<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>232</sup>Th) ratio of this material implies that detrital contamination would have a much stronger impact on the ages than a contaminant with a bulk Earth (<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>232</sup>Th) ratio and that the threshold for the commonly applied <sup>232</sup>Th reliability criterion would be much lower than the generally used value of 1 ng g<sup>−1</sup>. The coral showing apparently younger ages for its bulk material was probably influenced by more than one diagenetic process. A potential scenario is a combination of detrital contamination and U addition by secondary pore infillings.    Our results show that the dense theca wall material of <i>D. strigosa</i> is generally less affected by post-depositional open-system behaviour and better suited for <sup>230</sup>Th/U-dating than the bulk material. This is also obvious from the fact that all ages of theca wall material reflect a Last Interglacial origin (∼125 ka), whereas the bulk material samples are either substantially older or younger. However, for some corals, the <sup>230</sup>Th/U-ages and activity ratios of the bulk material and the theca wall samples are similar. This shows that strictly reliable <sup>230</sup>Th/U-ages can also be obtained from bulk material samples of exceptionally well-preserved corals. However, the bulk material samples more frequently show elevated activity ratios and ages than the corresponding theca wall samples. Our findings should be generally applicable to brain corals (Mussidae) that are found in tropical oceans worldwide and may enable reliable <sup>230</sup>Th/U-dating of fossil corals with similar skeletal architecture, even if their bulk skeleton is altered by diagenesis.    The <sup>230</sup>Th/U-ages we consider reliable (120–130 ka), along with a recently published age of 118 ka, provide the first comprehensive dating of the elevated lower reef terrace at Bonaire (118–130 ka), which is in agreement in timing and duration with other Last Interglacial records.","Obert, J.C.; Scholz, D.; Felis, T.; Brocas, W.M.; Jochum, K.P.; Andreae, M.O.",WOS:000371332900002,"Obert, J.

To find out if the presence of wind farms is influencing the feeding behaviour of both demersal fish, stomach content analyses were performed for both demersal fish species originating from the wind farm and from a nearby control area. Results on stomach fullness, frequency of occurrence and numerical percentage of prey taxa, prey diversity and prey species composition are discussed. The fullness index and prey diversity of lesser weever was not affected by the presence of the wind farm. However, the diet composition did change: lesser weever consumed significantly more of the species <i>Jassa herdmani</i> - which is typically associated with hard substrates and highly available in the wind farm- in both the control and to a greater extent in the impact area. The fullness index of dab also displayed no significant differences. The prey diversity and the diet composition of dab however, were influenced by the presence of the wind farm. The ampipods <i>Nototropis swammerdamei</i> and <i>J. herdmani</i> and the tube-building polychaete <i>Lanice conchilega</i> were responsible for those differences. The latter species is a well-known ecosystemengineer with the potential to enhance habitat complexity and heterogeneity. Its presence might have led to a significant higher prey diversity in the wind farm and hence in the diet of dab. The differences in feeding behaviour between wind farm and control area can in part be related to the presence of the wind farm, its associated fauna and the expanding reef effect.","Derweduwen, J.; Ranson, J.; Wittoeck, J.; Hostens, K.",NULL,"Hostens, Kris, K.","Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (ILVO), Animal Sciences, Aquatic Environment and Quality",NULL,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Book chapters,NULL,NULL

Mediterranean non-Siphonophoran Hydrozoa comprises 398 species, an increasing number due to continuous updates, representing about 10 % of the 3,702 currently valid species reported in a recent world assessment of hydrozoan diversity. Many new records are non indigenous species, previously described species that occurred elsewhere and whose arrival was presumably caused by human activities. However, many species reported in the past are not recorded in recent times. Realistic assessments of species pools require addition of new species, but also subtraction of species not found since a certain period. With the confidence of extinction index, cases of putative extinction can be raised. Out of the 398 known species, only 162 (41 %) have been reported in the last decade, while 53 (13 %) are not recorded in the literature since at least 41 years. According to the confidence of extinction index, 60 % of the 53 missing species are extinct, and 11 % are putatively extinct from the basin. From a biogeographical point of view, the missing species are: 34 % endemic, 19 % boreal, 15 % Mediterranean-Atlantic, 11 % Indo-Pacific, 11 % circumtropical, 4 % cosmopolitan, 2 % tropical-Atlantic, 4 % non-classifiable. Fluctuations in species composition into a certain area cause heavy variability in the expression of both structural and functional biodiversity.

Although the factors affecting the performance of small-scale marine protected areas are relatively well studied, there is no such body of knowledge for large marine protected areas. We conducted a global meta-analysis to systematically investigate social, ecological, and governance characteristics of successful large marine protected areas with respect to several social and ecological outcomes. We included all large (>10,000 km<sup>2</sup>), implemented (>5 years of active management) marine protected areas that had sufficient data for analysis, for a total of twelve cases. We used the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database, and a consistent protocol for using secondary data and key informant interviews, to code proxies for fisheries, ecosystem health, and the wellbeing of user groups (mainly fishers). We tested four sets of hypotheses derived from the literature on small-scale marine protected areas and common-pool resources: (i) the attributes of species and ecosystems to be managed in the marine protected area, (ii) adherence to principles for designing small-scale marine protected areas, (iii) adherence to the design principles for common-pool resource management, and (iv) stakeholder participation. We found varying levels of support for these hypotheses. Improved fisheries were associated with older marine protected areas, and higher levels of enforcement. Declining fisheries were associated with several ecological and economic factors, including low productivity, high mobility, and high market value. High levels of participation were correlated with improvements in wellbeing and ecosystem health trends. Overall, this study constitutes an important first step in identifying factors affecting social wellbeing and ecological performance of large marine protected areas.","Ban, N.C.; Davies, T.E.; Aguilera, S.E.; Brooks, C.M.; Cox, M.; Epstein, G.; Evans, L.S.; Maxwell, S.M.; Nenadovic, M.",WOS:000398868900008,"Davies, Tammy, T.E.",NULL,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.01.003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Large-scale marine protected areas; Common pool resources; Social-ecological systems; Governance; Marine conservation,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Straightforward methods, which require only simple modification of existing SDM techniques, have been recently proposed as a means to overcome this problem. Nevertheless, subsequent marine SDM studies have not adopted these modified techniques, continuing to draw conclusions from analyses that associate 2-dimensional (2D; i.e. surface) environmental data with occurrence points distributed in a 3-dimensional (3D) space (i.e. across a range of depths). These include studies involving multi-species macroecological assessments, where SDMs are rarely tailored to suit each species modelled. Here, we use traditional (2D) and modified (2.5D) SDM methods to emphasise the importance of incorporating depth in marine ecological modelling. We demonstrate that ignoring depth may lead to misrepresentative and potentially misleading results, and show that relatively straightforward 2.5D techniques provide an enhanced representation of the environmental niche and, therefore, produce more representative range estimates than their 2D counterparts. Explicit 3D approaches need to be developed to better represent marine diversity and distributions and to test macroecological generalisations.","Duffy, G.A.; Chown, S.L.",WOS:000400661400001,"Duffy, G.A.","Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12011,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,Pisces,NULL,NULL,3D modelling; Macroecology; Niche model; Pelagic fish; Species distribution; Species-environment relationships   ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Seventy satellite tags were deployed on basking sharks over four years (2012–2015) off the west coast of Scotland and the Isle of Man. Data from 28 satellite tags with attachment durations of over 165 days reveal post-summer ranging behaviours. Tagged sharks moved a median minimum straight-line distance of 3,633 km; achieving median displacement of 1,057 km from tagging locations. Tagged individuals exhibited one of three migration behaviours: remaining in waters of UK, Ireland and the Faroe Islands; migrating south to the Bay of Biscay or moving further south to waters off the Iberian Peninsula, and North Africa. Sharks used both continental shelf areas and oceanic habitats, primarily in the upper 50–200 m of the water column, spanning nine geo-political zones and the High Seas, demonstrating the need for multi-national cooperation in the management of this species across its range.","Doherty, P.D.; Baxter, J.M.; Gell, F.R.; Godley, B.J.; Graham, R.T.; Hall, G.; Hall, J.; Hawkes, L.A.; Henderson, S.M.; Johnson, L.; Speedie, C.",WOS:000394324400001,"Doherty, Philip, P.D.","Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep42837,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

According to the published literature, 115 echinoid species and one subspecies have been reported from Sri Lanka to date. However, the current study revealed that only 66 echinoid species and one subspecies belonging to 20 families can be verified to occur in Sri Lankan waters. According to the present analysis, 49 species were excluded from the list due to uncertain records (16) or synonymy (33) with other taxa known from the region. Of the 66 species and one subspecies occurring in Sri Lankan waters, 11 were first described from type material collected from this region. Six of the type specimens are “regular” echinoids and five are Irregularia. Out of these 11, <i>Araeosoma coriaceum indicum</i> has been recorded only from and appears to be endemic to Sri Lankan waters. However, 34 species of Sri Lankan echinoids have not been recorded in the last 90 years. Echinoid species recorded from Sri Lankan waters represent 6.7% of the currently accepted species of extant echinoids and include representatives of 28% of the extant echinoid families. Forty-five percent (45%) of echinoids recorded from the Indian coast (113 species and subspecies) are present in Sri Lankan waters. The current study highlights the need for systematic revision of echinoid records in Sri Lanka through field surveys and reconciliation of discrepancies in the existing literature. Offshore sampling is also needed due to lack of recent information on local deep-sea echinoids.","Arachchige, G.M.; Jayakody, S.; Mooi, R.; Kroh, A.",WOS:000393668200001,"Arachchige, Gayashan, G.M.","Wayamba Univ Sri Lanka, Dept Fisheries & Aquaculture, Makandura, Gonawila, Sri Lanka.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zootaxa.4231.2.1,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Sri Lanka,"Echinodermata, ""Echinoidea""",NULL,NULL,Annotated list; diversity; echinoids; historic records; taxonomic review,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Particularly characteristic, previously overlooked features of the genus include the presence of well-developed phyllodes made up from short, almost equidimensional plates in oral ambulacra II, III and IV. Unlike in other Spatangoidea, where the adoral plates rapidly become elongated towards the margin, they stay short in <i>Mariania </i>and are not constricted halfway between the peristome and the margin. In addition, most species of <i>Mariania </i>possess a characteristic domal profile with steep sides and lack a raised keel in aboral interambulacrum 5. Their petals are wide, open distally and extend almost to the margin. The plastron is not indented behind the episternal plates and the labral plate extends to the second ambulacral plates. Fascioles are missing in all specimens examined. The combination of these morphological features enable the separation of <i>Mariania </i>from the genera <i>Macropneustes</i>, <i>Hypsopatagus </i>and <i>Spatangus</i>, to which members of the genus have been assigned by previous authors. Cladistic analysis carried out to unravel the uncertain systematic position of <i>Mariania </i>failed to find well-supported relationships, but firmly places <i>Mariania </i>within the Brissidina. Most previous family attributions could be, however, ruled out. Based on the available data a placement within Spatangoidea seems most likely, where it takes up an intermediate position between maretiids, loveniids and spatangids. Three different species are identified within the studied sample: <i>Mariania marmorae</i>, the type species of the genus; <i>M. stefaninii </i>sp. nov. from the late Burdigalian-early Langhian of northern Italy; <i>M. comaschicariae </i>sp. nov. from the Burdigalian of Sardinia. These new species are distinguished from <i>M. marmorae </i>by their lower tests, shorter labral plates and shorter petals. <i>Mariania comaschicariae </i>sp. nov. differs from <i>M. stefaninii </i>sp. nov. by its lower test, more anterior apical disc and less numerous plates in the oral anterior paired ambulacra. Test morphology and parent rock sedimentology suggest that <i>Mariania </i>was an epifaunal echinoid, which lived in inner shelf environments, characterized by soft bottoms and a tropical climate.","Stara, P.; Borghi, E.; Kroh, A.",WOS:000372546600006,"Kroh, Andreas, A.","Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Dept Geol & Palaeontol, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.3140/bull.geosci.1576,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,"Echinodermata, ""Spatangoidea""","Neogene, ""New species"", ""Phylogeny""",NULL,Echinodermata; Spatangoidea; new species; phylogeny; Neogene;Mediterranean,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Since twaite shad is of conservation concern, further knowledge on its migration and reproductive behaviour is needed and acoustic telemetry would be a relevant tool to assess these behaviours. Shads are very sensitive fish showing adverse reactions to handling and anesthesia, specifically twaite shad. Therefore, this species is rather unsuitable for internal implantation of electronic tags, such as acoustic, radio and data storage tags. Preliminary tests are needed to assess the impact of external tagging on twaite shad survival. Here we describe a fish friendly attachment procedure to externally tag the fish. The procedure is quick and may limit additional drag force on swimming as the tags are firmly attached to the body by a rubber plate. This procedure was developed in Belgium in spring 2015 to tag eight shads in the Zeeschelde.

The temporal and spatial scales at which migrations occur and our inability to directly observe these nocturnal movements makes monitoring and characterizing this critical period in migratory animals’ life cycles difficult. Remote sensing, therefore, has played an important role in our understanding of large-scale nocturnal bird migrations. Weather surveillance radar networks in Europe and North America have great potential for long-term low-cost monitoring of bird migration at scales that have previously been impossible to achieve. Such long-term monitoring, however, poses a number of challenges for the ornithological and ecological communities: how does one take advantage of this vast data resource, integrate information across multiple sensors and large spatial and temporal scales, and visually represent the data for interpretation and dissemination, considering the dynamic nature of migration? We assembled an interdisciplinary team of ecologists, meteorologists, computer scientists, and graphic designers to develop two different flow visualizations, which are interactive and open source, in order to create novel representations of broad-front nocturnal bird migration to address a primary impediment to long-term, largescalenocturnal migration monitoring. We have applied these visualization techniques to mass bird migration events recorded by two different weather surveillance radar networks covering regions in Europe and North America.

By organizing a training course in Martinique, we wanted both to promote taxonomy and to provide a first inventory of the sponge diversity on this island. The course was like a naturalist expedition, with a field laboratory and a classroom nearby. Early-career scientists and environmental managers were trained in sponge taxonomy. We gathered unpublished data and conducted an inventory at 13 coastal sites. We explored only shallow water habitats (0–30 m), such as mangroves, reefs or rocky bottoms and underwater caves. According to this study, the sponge fauna of Martinique is currently represented by a minimum of 191 species, 134 of which we could assign species names. One third of the remaining non-identified sponge species we consider to be new to science. Martinique appears very remarkable because of its littoral marine fauna harboring sponge aggregations with high biomass and species diversity dominating over coral species. In mangroves, sponges cover about 10% of the surface of subtidal roots. Several submarine caves are true reservoirs of hidden and insufficiently described sponge diversity. Thanks to this new collaborative effort, the Eastern Caribbean has gained a significant increase of knowledge, with sponge diversity of this area potentially representing 40% of the total in the Caribbean Sea. We thus demonstrated the importance of developing exploratory and educational research in areas historically devoid of biodiversity inventories and systematics studies.

This study presents the results of three years of seabird tracking from the UK Overseas Territory of Anguilla, where marine resources are currently relatively unexploited and MSP is in its infancy. The core foraging areas of 1326 foraging trips from 238 individuals, representing five species (brown booby <i>Sula leucogaster</i>, masked booby <i>Sula dactylatra</i>, sooty tern <i>Onychoprion fuscatus</i>, magnificent frigatebird <i>Fregata magnificens</i> and red-billed tropicbird <i>Phaethon aethereus</i>) breeding on three of Anguilla's offshore cays were used to calculate the hotspot foraging areas for each study species. These high activity areas were then compared with fishing activity within Anguilla's Exclusive Economic zone and to proposed coastal developments. Two marine IBAs were identified within Anguilla's waters: the first to be defined, using seabird tracking data, in the Caribbean region. Whilst the level of fishing activity and associated seabird by-catch is hard to quantify, the core foraging areas of seabirds breeding in Anguilla were observed to overlap with areas known for high fishing activity.

Prudence suggests that we not repeat this pattern in the ocean. Here we assessed patterns of global marine biodiversity by evaluating the protections of 4352 species for which geographic ranges are known, and mapping priority areas using an index that considers species vulnerability, coverage by marine protected areas (MPAs), and human impacts. Species have, on average, only 3.6% of their range protected. Moreover, species of conservation concern (threatened, small-ranged, and data deficient) have less protection than species on average. Only 5 nations currently protect 10% or more of their exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as strict Marine Reserves (IUCN category I–IV) in accord with the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. One nation by itself, Australia, accounts for 65% of the global area of Marine Reserves. The Coral Triangle is the clear and dominant global priority for biodiversity, but we identify additional global and regional priorities in each ocean basin. As an example, we show that for the United States, the Marianas and Samoan Islands are the top marine conservation priorities.

Yet, even if recently the number of MPAs has increased rapidly worldwide, the area of ocean under some type of MPA classification is far behind the international targets (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity) considered essential for conservation of the world's oceans. Furthermore, coherence, representativeness and effectiveness of existing MPAs are largely unknown or even weakly defined. In this study, general characteristics of MPAs from Portugal, Spain and France were collected and used to evaluate conservation progress in this geographic area. In addition, an online questionnaire was administered to the MPAs managers, and focused on multiple processes inherent to each MPA, namely on the characteristics and suitability of planning, management, monitoring, governance and enforcement. Obtained responses were used to calculate the overall level of MPA management effectiveness, and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors that most contributed to differences in effectiveness. Most MPAs are adjacent to the coast, are small in area (near 50% have less than 20 km2) and were established with multiple goals concerning species conservation and sustainable development of economic activities (e.g. fisheries). Only 9% of analysed MPAs are larger than 1000 km2 and are unequally distributed among the study area. Overall, 46% of MPAs and 59% of total area covered were established during the last five years, while only 3 of the 35 no-take areas (22% in area) were implemented during this period. High MPA effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which an MPA is protecting values and achieving its goals and objectives) was related with high levels of stakeholders support, with suitable goals, management and enforcement. Results highlighted the need to improve MPA coverage taking into account other existing MPAs to increase coherence and representativeness of networks, that new no-take areas should be implemented in key conservation sites and that management strategies (e.g. enforcement and monitoring) should be strengthened. These findings are applicable to the study area yet methodology and outcomes are pertinent to MPA management worldwide. Ultimately, strategies aiming at maximizing MPA performance are probably as important as the increase of MPA coverage.","Batista, M.I.; Cabral, H.N.",WOS:000385321500002,"Batista, Marisa, M.I.","Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.07.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Environmental management; Convention for biological diversity; OSPAR; MSFD; MPA effectiveness; Stakeholders,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In this study, we used Maximum Entropy Modelling and presence data for two deep-sea sponge aggregation types, <i>Pheronema carpenteri</i> aggregations and ostur aggregations dominated by geodid sponges, to address the following questions: 1) What environmental factors drive the broad-scale distribution of these selected sponge grounds? 2) What is the predicted distribution of these grounds in the northern North Atlantic, Norwegian and Barents Sea? 3) How are these sponge grounds distributed between Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and High Seas areas? 4) What percentage of these grounds in High Seas areas are protected by the current High Seas MPA network? Our results suggest that silicate concentration, temperature, depth and amount of particulate organic carbon are the most important drivers of sponge distribution. Most of the sponge grounds are located within national EEZs rather than in the High Seas.

The spectral approach offers a detailed description of the different wave regimes, their associated meteorological conditions and their variation in time and geographical space. To this end, two complementary data sources are used, the first is representative for the near-shore zone and comes from observations of the local monitoring network. The second comes from numerical wave model results that cover the open ocean. The measured data used are the first systematically collected spectral wave data in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. Modelled spectra correspond to the ERA-Interim database of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts that spans 35 years. An indicator for statistical analysis of the wave spectra has been introduced which basically consists of the occurrence probability of spectral partitions. This indicator has proved to be skilful for the task of defining spectral wave systems of both model and, the more challenging, measured spectra. Following the spectral approach and using this new indicator, six main wave regimes are found in the study area. Two of these systems have well defined swell characteristics that are originated outside the study area in the northern and southern hemispheres. Other three wave systems are to a certain extent associated to the local winds, and in general may be classified as old wind-seas. These are found to flow northeastwards, westwards, and southwards. The sixth system is composed of locally generated wind waves of relatively low magnitude that propagate in several directions. The time variability of these wave systems is highly dependent on the boreal and austral winter storms and on the tropical conditions, in such a way that the wave energy propagation to the region is rather constant along the year, but their origin and characteristics vary significantly.","Portilla, J.; Caicedo, A.L.; Padilla-Hernández, R.; Cavaleri, L.",WOS:000358800800011,"Caicedo, Ana Lucía, A.L.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.06.005,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,    Colombian Pacific Ocean; Spectral wave climate; Triaxys buoy; ECMWF; ERA-Interim; Spectral partitioning,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Data quality analysis displays high reliability of NOAA/AVHRR and Aqua/MODIS satellite information. The Gulf of Finland’s average annual SST has changed from 6.8°C in 1982 up to 8.2°C in 2014. Its mean speed of warming is about 0.04°C year–1. The growth of the temperature was irregular, in the middle of 80th year, the temperature dropped down to 5.0°C, and then sharply increased up to 7.3°C in 1989. SST growth in the Gulf of Finland coincides with air temperature and sea temperature growth. The climate change in the Gulf of Finland has special significance due to the fragility of the northern ecosystems and high anthropogenic load.","Tronin, A.",WOS:000394651500004,"Tronin, Andrei, A.",Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences Saint-Petersburg Scientific-Research Centre for Ecological,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/01431161.2017.1286057,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The list is detailed according to the five demarcations of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (NOR, Spanish north coast; SUR, Spanish coast of the Gulf of Cádiz; ESAL, Strait of Gibraltar and Alboran Sea; LEBA, East coast of Spain and Balearic Islands; CAN, the Canary Islands). The list differentiates coastal species living from the supralittoral zone to the shelf break, deep-sea benthic or demersal species, and holoplanktonic species, and also distinguishes between non-indigenous species and species endemic to a particular demarcation. A total of 2466 marine Mollusca species have been reported from Spanish waters, of which 1126 are recorded only from waters surrounding the Iberian Peninsula, 498 are recorded from the Canaries only, and 842 are shared. That total number represents around 5.5% of the global marine molluscan richness. Shore and shelf species are the most numerous (1837), followed by deep-sea benthic species (490) and pelagic species (139), but the contribution of the deep-sea species is most noteworthy in NOR. All eight molluscan classes were represented, but solenogastres and scaphopods were notably more represented than usual in NOR. Species richness in SUR and ESAL was higher than would be expected from their areas, supporting the claim that Andalusian waters have an exceptionally diverse molluscan fauna. Thirteen species collected from INDEMARES cruises are here reported for the first time in Spanish waters. The species recorded in Spanish seas represent more than half of the 4340 species of Mollusca recorded within the scope of the European Register of Marine Species, making this the highest species count in European seas. The Canary Islands demarcation holds by far the largest number of endemic species (127), but special mention is needed regarding the ca. 20 species endemic to the Strait of Gibraltar, a highly anomalous chorotype in the marine realm. The number of non-indigenous species (38) is surprisingly low compared with that of species known in the Mediterranean Sea, amounting to hardly 1.5% of the total and supporting the view that a high number of native species tends to reduce invasion success. The list is seen as a much needed tool for the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, but requires permanent attention and curating in order to remain up-to-date.","Gofas, S.; Luque, Á.A.; Templado, J.; Salas, C.",WOS:000403554400010,"Templado, José, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3989/scimar.04543.21A,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Spain,NULL,Marine molluscs,NULL,Checklist,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Continental margins perform crucial functions linked to key ecological processes which are mainly structured by surface primary productivity and particulate organic matter flux to the seafloor, but also by heterogeneity in seafloor characteristics. However, to what extent these processes control local and regional biodiversity remains unclear. In this study, two isobathic parallel transects located at the shelf break (300-400 m) and upper slope (1000 m) of the western Iberian margin were used to test how food input and sediment heterogeneity affect nematode diversity independently from the spatial factors geographical distance and water depth. We also examined the potential role of connectedness between both depth transects through molecular phylogenetic analyses. Regional generic diversity and turnover were investigated at three levels: within a station, between stations from the same depth transect, and between transects. High variability in food availability and high sediment heterogeneity at the shelf-break transect were directly linked to high diversity within stations and higher variation in community structure across stations compared to the upper slope transect. Contrastingly, environmental factors (food availability and sediment) did not vary significantly between stations located at the upper slope, and this lack of differences were also reflected in a low community turnover between these deeper stations. Finally, differences in nematode communities between both transects were more pronounced than differences within each of the isobathic transects, but these changes were paralleled by the previously mentioned environmental changes. These results suggest that changes in community structure are mainly dictated by environmental factors rather than spatial differences at the western Iberian margin. Furthermore, phylogenetic relationships revealed no evidence for depth-endemic lineages, indicating regular species interchanges across different depths.","Lins, L.; Leliaert, F.; Riehl, T.; Ramalho, S.P.; Córdova, E.A.; Esteves, A.M.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000395316700003,"Leliaert, Frederik, F.","Marine Biology research group, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-14-651-2017,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Molecular sequence information from historical herbarium samples proves the presence of <i>D. cyanoloma</i> in the Adriatic Sea as early as 1935. Since approximately the year 2000, however, the number of records as well as the geographic range of the species has expanded significantly. The present-day distribution of <i>D. cyanoloma</i> occupies most of the Mediterranean Sea, Macaronesia, NW Africa and southern Portugal, but recent records from Galicia and SW England (Falmouth, Cornwall) indicate that the species is rapidly expanding northward. Collections from Australia demonstrated that the species is also present from Perth in Western Australia, over much of the southern Australian coastline up to Minnie Water in New South Wales. Phylogenetic analyses resolve <i>D. cyanoloma</i> in a sister clade to a previously unreported Australian <i>Dictyota</i> species. Analysis of genetic diversity of the mitochondrial markers (<i>nad</i>6–<i>nad</i>11 and <i>atp</i>9–<i>orf</i>11) reveals that even though Australian populations contain a much higher haplotype richness, European populations are also fairly diverse. Furthermore, only two out of 25 haplotypes are shared between both regions.

This study was designed to investigate the spatial and temporal variability patterns of species composition, densities and trophic composition of the benthic nematode assemblages in this early recovery process, at two sampling sites with three stations each and at five sampling occasions. Because of the erratic and highly patchy seagrass recovery and the high environmental similarity of the two sampling sites, we expected within-site variability in nematode assemblages to exceed between-site variability. However, contrary to that expectation, whilst nematode genus composition was broadly similar between sites, nematode densities differed significantly between sites, and this between-site variability exceeded within-site variability. This may be linked to differences in the Zostera recovery patterns between both sites. In addition, no clear temporal patterns of nematode density, trophic composition and diversity were evident.

The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.","Ximenes, A.C.; Maeda, E.E.; Arcoverde, G.F.B.; Dahdouh-Guebas, F.",WOS:000379985300011,"Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid, F.","Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Resource Management, Université Libre de Bruxelles - ULB",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs8060451,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,"Acanthaceae, ""Rhizophoraceae""",NULL,NULL,wetland; climate; conservation; remote sensing; data-driven; dataintensive science; Rhizophoraceae; Acanthaceae,Journal article,NULL,NULL

We studied both circadian and seasonal movement patterns and the effect of environmental variables on these patterns. Large female yellow eels were most active at night in late summer and early autumn. A generalised linear mixed model showed that their movement is only slightly influenced by environmental variables. Moreover, as yellow eels show high site fidelity (i.e., the majority was detected only in the habitat type of their catch-release location), they do not encounter many human-induced connectivity problems in polder systems, which makes these systems highly suitable as eel growth habitat.

Marine species distribution modelling is an important element of marine ecosystem management. It is relied upon by marine spatial planning for i.e. predicting biological resources, the design of marine protected areas, the designation of essential fish habitats, the assessment of species invasion risk, pest control, human-animal conflict prevention, ….This study aims to improve and contribute to the process and understanding of marine species distribution modelling in order to facilitate an in depth study of the trends, vectors and distribution of introduced seaweeds in Europe. More specifically we wanted to 1) provide quality indicators for the marine species distribution data available in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), 2) make global datasets for species distribution modelling in the past, current and future climate more accessible in R, 3) explore the relevance of different predictors of marine species distributions with MarineSPEED, a marine benchmark dataset of more than 500 species, 4) investigate the introduction history and trends in introduced seaweeds in Europe, 5) evaluate the risk of aquarium trade as a vector for future introductions of seaweeds and 6) study the ability of species distribution modelling to predict the introduction and spread of introduced seaweeds and propose a method for identifying candidate areas for further spreading under climate change.

In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during long-term exposure on the seafloor, both at a harbor and an offshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during biofilm formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identified a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of biofilm formation. Additionally, by implementing ITS2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identified and characterized for the first time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to offshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage biofilm, suggesting that biofilm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates.","De Tender, C.; Devriese, L.I.; Haegeman, A.; Maes, S.; Vangeyte, J.; Cattrijsse, A.; Dawyndt, P.; Ruttink, T.",WOS:000405056200006,"De Tender, Caroline, C.","Institute of Agricultural, Fisheries and Food Research (ILVO)",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1021/acs.est.7b00697,NULL,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

IUU fishing is an activity which seeks to avoid official monitoring and for which a deficient of reliable information often exists, yet global studies of its extent suggest that it may have accounted for as much as 20 % of the world’s marine capture harvest in the final two decades of the twentieth century. This chapter considers IUU fishing from the historians’ perspective. It provides a short history of IUU fishing, locating the phenomenon in the global expansion of marine capture fisheries and the changes to the regulation of fishing industries and control over maritime space and marine living resources that took place during the twentieth century. Three case-studies of IUU fishing from the Indo-Pacific are examined in detail: the Southern Ocean fishery for Patagonian toothfish (<i>Dissostichus eleginoides</i>); the presence of Indonesian fishers in the Australian Fishing Zone; and Japanese under-reporting of Southern Bluefin Tuna (<i>Thunnus maccoyii</i>) catches.

An important role in the implementation process is assigned to science. For three core elements, defining the favourable conservation status, development of best practice measures, and monitoring of the conservation status, we outline how science can support decision making. To do so, we use experiences from the ongoing process in Flanders (northern Belgium). First, when determining the favourable conservation status, information on reference values are embedded in a specifically developed calibration model where thresholds on range, area, and quality are set for habitats. Subsequently, socio-economical requirements are taken into consideration, without compromising the favourable conservation status. When it comes to conducting measures, science adds to the knowledge on developing and optimizing cost-effective conservation and restoration management measures. Finally, monitoring of the conservation status will be based on the principle of statistically sound methodologies, enabling the identification of reliability in the assessments made. For habitats, information on area will be gathered through a surface-covering mapping, while quality will be assessed via a sample-oriented monitoring scheme. For species, maximal collaboration with non-governmental organisations will be undertaken, with scientific support on data recording and processing. Overall, the obtained insights will help policy makers to define the framework and set priorities, take the appropriate measures, and keep a finger on the pulse through monitoring data.","Louette, G.; Adriaens, A.; Paelinckx, D.; Hoffmann, M.",WOS:000349758900004,"Paelinckx, Desiré, D.",Research Institute for Nature and Forest,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jnc.2014.12.002,NULL,Lifewatch acknowledged,NULL,NULL,"Management, ""Monitoring""",NULL,Favourable conservation status; measures; Natura 2000; Reference values,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In such a complex landscape, it can be unclear how different elements relate to each other. Based on a high-level review of global and European-level elements, we present a map of the biodiversity informatics landscape. This is a first attempt at identifying key datasets/databases and data services, and mapping them in a way that can be used to identify the links, gaps and redundancies in the landscape. While the map is predominantly focused on elements with a global scope, the sub-global focus at the European-level was incorporated in the map in order to demonstrate how a regional network such as the European Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON) can usefully contribute to connecting some of the nodes within the landscape. We identify 74 elements, and find that the informatics landscape is complex in terms of the characteristics and diversity of these elements, and that there is high variability in their level of connectedness. Overall, the landscape is highly connected, with one element boasting 28 connections. The average ""degrees of separation"" between elements is low, and the landscape is deemed relatively robust to failures since there is no single point that information flows through. Examples of possible effort duplication are presented, and the inclusion of five policy-level elements in the map helps illustrate how informatics products can contribute to global processes that define and direct political targets. Beyond simply describing the existing landscape, this map will support a better understanding of the landscape’s current structure and functioning, enabling responsible institutions to establish or strengthen collaborations, work towards avoiding effort duplication, and facilitate access to the biodiversity data, information and knowledge required to support effective decision-making, in the context of comparatively limited funding for biodiversity knowledge and conservation. To support this, we provide the input matrix and code that created this map as supplementary materials, so that readers can more closely examine the links in the landscape, and edit the map to suit their own purposes.","Bingham, H.; Doudin, M.; Weatherdon, L.V.; Despot-Belmonte, K.; Wetzel, F.T.; Groom, Q.; Lewis, E.; Regan, E.; Appeltans, W.; Güntsch, A.; Mergen, M.; Agosti, D.; Penev, L.; Hoffmann, A.; Saarenmaa, H.; Geller, G.; Kim, K.; Kim, H.; Archambeau, A-S.; Haüser, C.; Schmeller, D.S.; Geijzendorffer, I.; García Camacho, A.; Guerra, C.; Robertson, T.; Runnel, V.; Valland, N.; Martin, C.S.",NULL,"Weatherdon, Lauren, L.V.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/rio.3.e14059,NULL,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,"Data, ""Indicators""",NULL,Biodiversity informatics; network,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Yet only 16% of all named species on Earth are marine. Species richness decreases with depth in the ocean, reflecting wider geographic ranges of deep sea than coastal species. Here, we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by human impacts. Such threats now extend globally, and thus the only refuges for these species will be large, permanent, fully protected marine reserves.","Costello, M.J.; Chaudhary, C.",WOS:000402814600035,"Costello, Mark, M.J.","Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.060,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This highlights the importance of understanding the processes governing species distribution at local scales. However, research on species distribution often averages environmental covariates across large geographic areas, missing variability in population-environment interactions within geographically distinct regions. We used spatially explicit models to identify interactions between species and environmental, including chlorophyll a (Chla) and sea surface temperature (SST), and trophic (prey density) conditions, along with processes governing the distribution of two cephalopods with contrasting life-histories (octopus and squid) across the western Mediterranean Sea. This approach is relevant for cephalopods, since their population dynamics are especially sensitive to variations in habitat conditions and rarely stable in abundance and location. The regional distributions of the two cephalopod species matched two different trophic pathways present in the western Mediterranean Sea, associated with the Gulf of Lion upwelling and the Ebro river discharges respectively. The effects of the studied environmental and trophic conditions were spatially variant in both species, with usually stronger effects along their distributional boundaries. We identify areas where prey availability limited the abundance of cephalopod populations as well as contrasting effects of temperature in the warmest regions. Despite distributional patterns matching productive areas, a general negative effect of Chla on cephalopod densities suggests that competition pressure is common in the study area. Additionally, results highlight the importance of trophic interactions, beyond other common environmental factors, in shaping the distribution of cephalopod populations. Our study presents a valuable approach for understanding the spatially variant ecology of cephalopod populations, which is important for fisheries and ecosystem management.","Puerta, P.; Hunsicker, M.E.; Quetglas, A.; Alvarez-Berastegui, D.; Esteban, A.; González, M.; Hidalgo, M.",WOS:000358597100064,"Hidalgo, Manuel, M.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0133439,NULL,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The four most frequent taxa include the gastropods, <i>Columbella rustica, Theodoxus</i> cf. <i>jordani</i>, and <i>Tritia gibbosula</i> (formerly known as <i>Nassarius gibbosulus</i>), as well as scaphopods. Most of the shells are perforated or, in the case of scaphopods, segmented. These taxa count among the most common shell beads observed at Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic sites of the Levant, although their proportions change over time. Other taxa are also present, but to a much lesser degree, and often occur as unique specimens. We compare the shell assemblages from these localities to similar contexts in Syria, Israel and Jordan. The shell taxa observed are consistent with other Epipaleolithic sites. We hypothesize that the most common shells at Baaz, Kaus Kozah and Ain Dabbour signify group identity, although the proportion of scaphopods is considerably less than that observed from the wider region.

DNA barcoding is widely used for species identification; however, as this method relies on the previous morphological identification of the specimens, some of the DNA sequences stored in DNA databases are incorrectly assigned to a given species. In view of this uncertainty, further criteria beyond morphological characters and DNA sequences in databases are required to more reliably and accurately identify marine mussels.

Our results show that the use of a sieve with a 1.0-mm mesh size gives results for community structure comparable to results obtained from a 0.5-mm mesh size, which allows reliable comparisons of recent and past spatiotemporal surveys of macroinfauna. In addition to our primary objective of comparing methods, we also found interacting effects of seasons and depths of collection. Seasonal differences (summer and fall) were seen in infaunal assemblages in the wave-induced sediment motion zone but not deeper. Thus, studies where wave-induced sediment motion can structure the benthic communities, especially during the winter months, should consider this effect when making temporal comparisons. In addition, some macrofauna taxa-like polychaetes and amphipods show high interannual variabilities, so spatiotemporal studies should make sure to cover several years before drawing any conclusions.","Hemery, L.G.; Politano, K.K.; Henkel, S.K.",WOS:000410241300017,"Hemery, Lenaïg, L.G.","Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10661-017-6127-8,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,Continental shelf,NULL,Macroinvertebrate; Infauna; Assemblage; Sieve mesh size; Season ,Journal article,NULL,NULL

By exploring untapped geographical sources and/or novel groups of organisms one can maximize the search for new marine drugs to treat human diseases. The goal of this paper is to analyse the trends associated with the discovery of new marine natural products from invertebrates (NMNPI) over the last two decades. The analysis considers different taxonomical levels and geographical approaches of bioprospected species. Additionally, this research is also directed to provide new insights into less bioprospected taxa and world regions. In order to gather the information available on NMNPI, the yearly-published reviews of Marine Natural Products covering 1990–2009 were surveyed. Information on source organisms, specifically taxonomical information and collection sites, was assembled together with additional geographical information collected from the articles originally describing the new natural product. Almost 10000 NMNPI were discovered since 1990, with a pronounced increase between decades. Porifera and Cnidaria were the two dominant sources of NMNPI worldwide. The exception was polar regions where Echinodermata dominated. The majority of species that yielded the new natural products belong to only one class of each Porifera and Cnidaria phyla (Demospongiae and Anthozoa, respectively). Increased bioprospecting efforts were observed in the Pacific Ocean, particularly in Asian countries that are associated with the Japan Biodiversity Hotspot and the Kuroshio Current. Although results show comparably less NMNPI from polar regions, the number of new natural products per species is similar to that recorded for other regions. The present study provides information to future bioprospecting efforts addressing previously unexplored taxonomic groups and/or regions. We also highlight how marine invertebrates, which in some cases have no commercial value, may become highly valuable in the ongoing search for new drugs from the sea.","Leal, M.C.; Puga, J.; Serôdio, J.; Gomes, N.C.M.; Calado, R.",WOS:000301568100058,"Puga, João, J.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0030580,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The identification of unifying principles of organism functioning across all domains would facilitate a cause and effect understanding of such changes and their implications for ecosystem shifts. For example, the functional specialization of all organisms in limited temperature ranges leads us to ask for unifying functional reasons. Organisms also specialize in either anoxic or various oxygen ranges, with animals and plants depending on high oxygen levels. Here, we identify thermal ranges, heat limits of growth, and critically low (hypoxic) oxygen concentrations as proxies of tolerance in a meta-analysis of data available for marine organisms, with special reference to domain-specific limits. For an explanation of the patterns and differences observed, we define and quantify a proxy for organismic complexity across species from all domains. Rising complexity causes heat (and hypoxia) tolerances to decrease from Archaea to Bacteria to uni- and then multicellular Eukarya. Within and across domains, taxon-specific tolerance limits likely reflect ultimate evolutionary limits of its species to acclimatization and adaptation. We hypothesize that rising taxon-specific complexities in structure and function constrain organisms to narrower environmental ranges. Low complexity as in Archaea and some Bacteria provide life options in extreme environments. In the warmest oceans, temperature maxima reach and will surpass the permanent limits to the existence of multicellular animals, plants and unicellular phytoplankter.

Yet, despite the global importance of biodiversity and increasing threats to it (e.g., [1-4]), we are no better able to estimate global species richness now than we were six decades ago [5]. Estimates of global species richness remain highly uncertain and are often logically inconsistent [5]. They are also difficult to validate because estimation of global species richness requires extrapolation beyond the number of species known [6-13]. Given that somewhere between 3% and >96% of species on Earth may remain undiscovered [4], depending on the methods used and the taxa considered, such extrapolations, especially from small percentages of known species, are likely to be highly uncertain [13, 14]. An alternative approach is to estimate all species, the known and unknown, directly. Using expert taxonomic knowledge of the species already described and named, those already discovered but not yet described and named, and those still awaiting discovery, we estimate there to be 830,000 (95% credible limits: 550,0001,330,000) multi-cellular species on coral reefs worldwide, excluding fungi. Uncertainty surrounding this estimate and its components were often strongly skewed toward larger values, indicating that many more species on coral reefs is more plausible than many fewer. The uncertainties revealed here should guide future research toward achieving convergence in global species richness estimates for coral reefs and other ecosystems via adaptive learning protocols whereby such estimates can be tested and improved, and their uncertainties reduced, as new knowledge is acquired.","Fisher, R.; O'Leary, R.A.; Low-Choy, S.; Mengersen, K.; Knowlton, N.; Brainard, R.E.; Caley, M.J.",WOS:000349375900028,"Fisher, Rebecca, R.","UWA Oceans Inst, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2014.12.022,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Overall, no particular association was identified between marine invertebrate taxa and chemical groups of new NPs. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that most NPs recorded from cnidarians and mollusks were terpenoids, while most NPs identified in echinoderms were aliphatic compounds or carbohydrates.

The extent of threats faced by marine systems, and their resilience to them, receive considerable attention [2, 4-6], but the detectability of marine extinctions is less well understood. Before its extinction or threat status is recorded, a species must be both taxonomically described and then formally assessed; lower rates of either process for marine species could thus impact patterns of extinction risk, especially as species missing from taxonomic inventories may often be more vulnerable than described species [7-11]. We combine data on taxonomic description with conservation assessments from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to test these possibilities across almost all marine and non-marine eukaryotes. We find that the 9-fold lower rate of recorded extinctions and 4-fold lower rate of ongoing extinction risk across marine species can be explained in part by differences in the proportion of species assessed by the IUCN (3% cf. 4% of non-marine species). Furthermore, once taxonomic knowledge and conservation assessments pass a threshold level, differences in extinction risk between marine and non-marine groups largely disappear. Indeed, across the best-studied taxonomic groups, there is no difference between marine and non-marine systems, with on average between 20% and 25% of species being threatened with extinction, regardless of realm.","Webb, T.J.; Mindel, B.L.",WOS:000349375900029,"Webb, Thomas, T.J.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2014.12.023,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The history of taxonomic discovery over the last two centuries is reviewed. Although a well defined order with the Peracarida, their relationship to other orders is not yet resolved but systematics of the major subordinal taxa is relatively well understood. Isopods range in size from less than 1 mm to <i>Bathynomus giganteus</i> at 365 mm long. They inhabit all marine habitats down to 7280 m depth but with few doubtful exceptions species have restricted biogeographic and bathymetric ranges. Four feeding categories are recognised as much on the basis of anecdotal evidence as hard data: detritus feeders and browsers, carnivores, parasites, and filter feeders. Notable among these are the Cymothooidea that range from predators and scavengers to external blood-sucking micropredators and parasites. Isopods brood 10–1600 eggs depending on individual species. Strong sexual dimorphism is characteristic of several families, notably in Gnathiidae where sessile males live with a harem of females while juvenile praniza stages are ectoparasites of fish. Protandry is known in Cymothoidae and protogyny in Anthuroidea. Some Paranthuridae are neotenous. About half of all coastal, shelf and upper bathyal species have been recorded in the MEOW temperate realms, 40% in tropical regions and the remainder in polar seas. The greatest concentration of temperate species is in Australasia; more have been recorded from temperate North Pacific than the North Atlantic. Of tropical regions, the Central Indo-Pacific is home to more species any other region. Isopods are decidedly asymmetrical latitudinally with 1.35 times as many species in temperate Southern Hemisphere than the temperate North Atlantic and northern Pacific, and almost four times as many Antarctic as Arctic species. More species are known from the bathyal and abyssal Antarctic than Arctic GOODS provinces, and more from the larger Pacific than Atlantic oceans. Two areas with many species known are the New Zealand-Kermadec and the Northern North Pacific provinces. Deep hard substrates such as found on seamounts and the slopes are underrepresented in samples. This, the documented numbers of undescribed species in recent collections and probable cryptic species suggest a large as yet undocumented fauna, potentially an order of magnitude greater than presently known.","Poore, G.C.B.; Bruce, N.L.",WOS:000308221300017,"Poore, Gary, G.C.B.","Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0043529,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Because the number of species in Canadian oceans remains uncertain, there is a need to incorporate molecular methods into species identifications. A 648 base pair segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene has proven useful for the identification and discovery of species in many animal lineages. While the utility of DNA barcoding in molluscs has been demonstrated in other studies, this is the first effort to construct a DNA barcode registry for marine molluscs across such a large geographic area.This study examines patterns of DNA barcode variation in 227 species of Canadian marine molluscs. Intraspecific sequence divergences ranged from 0–26.4% and a barcode gap existed for most taxa. Eleven cases of relatively deep (>2%) intraspecific divergence were detected, suggesting the possible presence of overlooked species. Structural variation was detected in COI with indels found in 37 species, mostly bivalves. Some indels were present in divergent lineages, primarily in the region of the first external loop, suggesting certain areas are hotspots for change. Lastly, mean GC content varied substantially among orders (24.5%–46.5%), and showed a significant positive correlation with nearest neighbour distances. DNA barcoding is an effective tool for the identification of Canadian marine molluscs and for revealing possible cases of overlooked species. Some species with deep intraspecific divergence showed a biogeographic partition between lineages on the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts, suggesting the role of Pleistocene glaciations in the subdivision of their populations. Indels were prevalent in the barcode region of the COI gene in bivalves and gastropods. This study highlights the efficacy of DNA barcoding for providing insights into sequence variation across a broad taxonomic group on a large geographic scale.","Layton, K.S.; Martel, A.L.; Hebert, P.D.N.",WOS:000335309100058,"Layton, Kara, K.S.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0095003,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Although detritus was the dominant food item in the majority of amphipods, gammarideans also included carnivorous (mainly feeding on crustaceans) and herbivorous species (feeding on macroalgal tissues). Our study revealed that general assignment of a type of diet for a whole family is not always adequate. Some families showed a consistent pattern in most of the studied species (Corophiidae, Pontoporeiidae = detritivorous; Oedicerotidae, Phoxocephalidae, Stenothoidae = carnivorous; Ampithoidae = primarily herbivorous on macroalgae), but others included species with totally different feeding strategies. In general terms, detritivorous families were characterized by a stronger mandibular molar, while in carnivorous taxa this feature was less developed or reduced. The percentage of macroalgae in the digestive contents was associated in most cases with a reduction or loss of the mandibular palp.

Surveys were conducted with the same method (time-based visual census along random paths), in the same sites, by the same people. Semi-quantitative inventories of conspicuous species were analysed by univariate and multivariate techniques. Available information on the main potential stressors indicated that a regime shift has occurred in these 30+ years: sea surface temperature rose by1-2°C, human pressure grew impressively, and invasion by several alien species took place. Consistently, a phase shift occurred in the biological communities. Of the 120 conspicuous species found in total, only 51 were common to both surveys; 31 species (‘losses’) were found in 1981 but not again in 2013, 38 (‘gains’) were found exclusively in 2013, 16 (‘winners’) increased their abundance, 8 (‘losers’) got scarcer, and 27 underwent little or no change. Gains included 7 alien, 2 nitrophilic, and 7 thermophilic species. Multivariate analysis evidenced biotic homogenisation in 2013 and huge change in rocky reef habitats. The once flourishing algal forests have disappeared to leave space to sponges and wide areas of bare substratum. This has most probably been the result of overgrazing by alien herbivorous fishes (<i>Siganus luridus</i> and <i>S. rivulatus</i>), whose establishment and spread has been favoured by seawater warming; the synergic action of local human impacts was also evidenced.","Bianchi, C.N.; Corsini-Foka, M.; Morri, C.; Zenetos, A.",WOS:000345296200002,"Bianchi, C.N.","Univ Genoa, DiSTAV Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.12681/mms.678,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Regime shift, phase shift, reference conditions, global change, seawater warming, human pressure, alien species, Mediterranean Sea.",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Species were classified according to their establishment status (‘Questionable’, ‘Casual’, ‘Established’, ‘Invasive’) and origin (‘Alien’, ‘Range expansion’, ‘Cryptogenic’). A total of 31 species were added to the inventory, while 6 species have been removed, bringing the total number of species to 73. Of these, 66 are considered to be aliens (or putative aliens but with uncertain origin) with the remaining 7 resulting from range expansion. Six records are considered to be questionable and hence unverified. For verified records, the dominant taxonomic groups are Mollusca (represented by 21 species) and Actinopterygii (15 species), followed by Crustacea (8 species) and Rhodophyta (7 species). Eight of these species (aliens: <i>Caulerpa cylindracea, Lophocladia lallemandi, Womersleyella setacea, Brachidontes pharaonis, Percnon gibbesi, Fistularia commersonii, Siganus luridus</i>; range extender: <i>Sphoeroides pachygaster</i>) are considered to be invasive. The introduction pathway for 30 species is unknown. Amongst the alien species, ‘Shipping’ is the most common introduction pathway, followed by ‘Secondary dispersal’ from elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. An increasing trend in the number of alien marine species reported from the Maltese Islands is evident, with a peak of 22 species recorded during the last decade (2001–2010). A discussion on the rationale for including range-expanding species in national inventories of recent arrivals, and in the analysis of trends in records from the Maltese Islands, is included. In particular, the general warming trend of Mediterranean surface waters appears to be facilitating the westward spread of thermophilic alien species from the Eastern to the Central Mediterranean, and the eastward range expansion of tropical and subtropical Eastern Atlantic species.","Evans, J.; Barbara, J.; Schembri, P.J.",WOS:000351926200021,"Evans, J.","Univ Malta, Dept Biol, Msida, Malta.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.12681/mms.1064,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Alien species, Invasive species, Range expansion, Species introduction, Biodiversity, Malta.",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Herein an attempt was made to evaluate the ecological significance of this particular ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered a biodiversity hotspot. This was accomplished by using Porifera, which dominate the rocky sublittoral substrata, as a reference group in a meta-analytical approach, combining primary research data from the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) with data derived from the literature. In total 311 species from all poriferan classes were recorded, representing 45.7% of the Mediterranean Porifera. Demospongiae and Homoscleromorpha are highly represented in marine caves at the family (88%), generic (70%), and species level (47.5%), the latter being the most favored group along with Dictyoceratida and Lithistida. Several rare and cave-exclusive species were reported from only one or few caves, indicating the fragmentation and peculiarity of this unique ecosystem. Species richness and phylogenetic diversity varied among Mediterranean areas; the former was positively correlated with research effort, being higher in the northern Mediterranean, while the latter was generally higher in caves than in the overall sponge assemblages of each area. Resemblance analysis among areas revealed that cavernicolous sponge assemblages followed a pattern quite similar to that of the overall Mediterranean assemblages. The same pattern was exhibited by the zoogeographic affinities of cave sponges: species with Atlanto-Mediterranean distribution and Mediterranean endemics prevailed (more than 40% each), 70% of them having warm-water affinities, since most caves were studied in shallow waters. According to our findings, Mediterranean marine caves appear to be important sponge biodiversity reservoirs of high representativeness and great scientific interest, deserving further detailed study and protection.","Gerovasileiou, V.; Voultsiadou, E.",WOS:000306362400025,"Voultsiadou, Eleni, E.","Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0039873,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

This study is a first attempt to compile the largest possible body of data available from different databases as well as from individual published or unpublished datasets regarding diatom distribution in the world ocean. The data obtained originate from time series studies as well as spatial studies. This effort is supported by the Marine Ecosystem Model Inter-Comparison Project (MAREMIP), which aims at building consistent datasets for the main plankton functional types (PFTs) in order to help validate biogeochemical ocean models by using carbon (C) biomass derived from abundance data. In this study we collected over 293 000 individual geo-referenced data points with diatom abundances from bottle and net sampling. Sampling site distribution was not homogeneous, with 58% of data in the Atlantic, 20% in the Arctic, 12% in the Pacific, 8% in the Indian and 1% in the Southern Ocean. A total of 136 different genera and 607 different species were identified after spell checking and name correction. Only a small fraction of these data were also documented for biovolumes and an even smaller fraction was converted to C biomass. As it is virtually impossible to reconstruct everyone's method for biovolume calculation, which is usually not indicated in the datasets, we decided to undertake the effort to document, for every distinct species, the minimum and maximum cell dimensions, and to convert all the available abundance data into biovolumes and C biomass using a single standardized method. Statistical correction of the database was also adopted to exclude potential outliers and suspicious data points. The final database contains 90 648 data points with converted C biomass. Diatom C biomass calculated from cell sizes spans over eight orders of magnitude. The mean diatom biomass for individual locations, dates and depths is 141.19 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>, while the median value is 11.16 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>. Regarding biomass distribution, 19% of data are in the range 0–1 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>, 29% in the range 1–10 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>, 31% in the range 10–100 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>, 18% in the range 100–1000 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>, and only 3% > 1000 μg C l<sup>−1</sup>. Interestingly, less than 50 species contributed to > 90% of global biomass, among which centric species were dominant. Thus, placing significant efforts on cell size measurements, process studies and C quota calculations of these species should considerably improve biomass estimates in the upcoming years. A first-order estimate of the diatom biomass for the global ocean ranges from 444 to 582 Tg C, which converts to 3 to 4 Tmol Si and to an average Si biomass turnover rate of 0.15 to 0.19 d<sup>−1</sup>.

Here, we present an extensive compilation on functional knowledge of benthic macrofauna using the categorical trait approach and scores of both common and rare species for 25 biological traits, including 102 modalities. We empirically quantify functional trait richness, within-trait species richness (redundancy), and trait variability on a large regional scale (>1000 km), in three environmentally different areas (basins of a sea), over a long time-span (10 years). To develop further the usage of multiple categorical traits as an analysis tool, we examine the effect of sampling effort for the understanding of the functional properties of the benthic meta-assemblages. We also evaluate the relationship between species richness and trait richness in order to understand co-variation between trait modalities and how traits are packaged within species. Results show that the biological diversity in terms of traits could be distinguished between areas of higher and lower salinity, higher and lower anthropogenic stress, and higher and lower species richness. A considerably lower number of samples are needed to portray the functional structure of an area in relation to the taxonomic structure, thereby demonstrating the advantage of using traits when considering management and conservation issues. Using categorical traits empirically requires, as shown within this study, an understanding of the relationship between species richness and expression of traits, co-variation of traits at different species richness and composition levels, acknowledgment of differences in trait expressions between common and rare species, and variability in abundance of species.

Populations are thus inevitably isolated, and allopatric speciation and high regional diversity are inevitable; cosmopolitan distributions are considered to be unlikely or non-existent. Options for passive dispersion are discussed. Tanaidaceans appear to have first evolved in shallow waters, the region of greatest diversification of the Apseudomorpha and some tanaidomorph families, while in deeper waters the apseudomorphs have subsequently evolved two or three distinct phyletic lines. The Neotanaidomorpha has evolved separately and diversified globally in deep waters, and the Tanaidomorpha has undergone the greatest evolution, diversification and adaptation, to the point where some of the deep-water taxa are recolonizing shallow waters. Analysis of their geographic distribution shows some level of regional isolation, but suffers from inclusion of polyphyletic taxa and a general lack of data, particularly for deep waters. It is concluded that the diversity of the tanaidomorphs in deeper waters and in certain ocean regions remains to be discovered; that the smaller taxa are largely understudied; and that numerous cryptic species remain to be distinguished. Thus the number of species currently recognized is likely to be an order of magnitude too low, and globally the Tanaidacea potentially rival the Amphipoda and Isopoda in diversity.","Blazewicz-Paszkowycz , M.; Bamber, R.N.; Anderson, G.",WOS:000304855200008,"Bamber, Roger, R.N.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0033068,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

In total, 795 epicarideans are known, representing ∼7.7% of described isopods. The rate of description of parasitic species has not matched that of free-living isopods and this disparity will likely continue due to the more cryptic nature of these parasites. Distribution patterns of epicarideans are influenced by a combination of their definitive (both benthic and pelagic species) and intermediate (pelagic copepod) host distributions, although host specificity is poorly known for most species. Among epicarideans, nearly all species in Bopyroidea are ectoparasitic on decapod hosts. Bopyrids are the most diverse taxon (605 species), with their highest diversity in the North West Pacific (139 species), East Asian Sea (120 species), and Central Indian Ocean (44 species). The diversity patterns of Cryptoniscoidea (99 species, endoparasites of a diverse assemblage of crustacean hosts) are distinct from bopyrids, with the greatest diversity of cryptoniscoids in the North East Atlantic (18 species) followed by the Antarctic, Mediterranean, and Arctic regions (13, 12, and 8 species, respectively).

Entoniscidae (37 species, endoparasites within anomuran, brachyuran and shrimp hosts) show highest diversity in the North West Pacific (10 species) and North East Atlantic (8 species). Most epicarideans are known from relatively shallow waters, although some bopyrids are known from depths below 4000 m. Lack of parasitic groups in certain geographic areas is likely a sampling artifact and we predict that the Central Indian Ocean and East Asian Sea (in particular, the Indo-Malay-Philippines Archipelago) hold a wealth of undescribed species, reflecting our knowledge of host diversity patterns.","Williams, J.D.; Boyko, C.B.",WOS:000305345200034,"Williams, Jason, J.D.","Hofstra Univ, Dept Biol, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0035350,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

However, the trade has also been implicated as having potentially widespread environmental impacts that has in part driven developments in aquaculture to relieve wild collection pressures. This study investigates the biodiversity in hobbyist aquaria (using an online survey) and those species currently available from an aquaculture source (commercial data and hobbyist initiatives) in the context of a traffic light system to highlight gaps in aquaculture effort and identify groups that require fisheries assessments. Two hundred and sixty nine species including clown fish, damsels, dotty backs, angelfish, gobies, sea horses and blennies, have reported breeding successes by hobbyists, a pattern mirrored by the European and US commercial organisations. However, there is a mismatch (high demand and low/non-existent aquaculture) for a number of groups including tangs, starfish, anemones and hermit crabs, which we recommend are priority candidates for local stock assessments. Hobbyist perception towards the concept of a sustainable aquarium trade is also explored with results demonstrating that only 40% of respondents were in agreement with industry and scientists who believe the trade could be an exemplar of a sustainable use of coral reefs. We believe that a more transparent evidence base, including the publication of the species collected and cultured, will go some way to align the concept of a sustainable trade across industry stakeholders and better inform the hobbyist when purchasing their aquaria stock. We conclude by proposing that a certification scheme established with government support is the most effective way to move towards a self-regulating industry. It would prevent industry “greenwashing” from multiple certification schemes, alleviate conservation concerns, and, ultimately, support aquaculture initiatives alongside well managed ornamental fisheries.","Murray, J.M.; Watson, G.J.",WOS:000342030300014,"Murray, Joanna, J.M.","Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0105982,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

The system is designed to assemble, store and disseminate comprehensive data on NIS, and assist the evaluation of the progress made towards achieving management goals. With the coming into force of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and similar legislation addressing the problem of biological invasions, the availability of advanced, scientifically validated and up-to-date information support on NIS is essential for aquatic ecosystem assessment and management.

Monoclonal strains of <i>C. socialis</i>  isolated from NE Atlantic/Arctic and Tyrrhenian Sea waters were cultivated at 2.5, 8 and 13°C, and analysed for morphological, phylogenetic (LSU rRNA gene) and physiological (growth rate, photosynthetic yield) traits. The molecular analysis indicated an unequivocal divergence between the southern and the northern strains. Clear differences in spore morphology between the two groups were also observed, despite their morphological similarity in vegetative form. The physiological data demonstrated a functional partition between the northern and southern strains. The northern strains showed significantly higher growth rates than the southern ones at the lower temperatures, and vice versa at 13°C. Differences between the groups were also observed in the photosynthetic yields. These results reveal the expression of allopatric speciation in several phenotypic characters, providing a functional dimension to the cryptic, or rather pseudo-cryptic, diversity observed within <i>C. socialis</i>. We believe that such an integrated approach is useful for robust taxonomic and functional delimitations of presumed cosmopolitan microorganisms.","Degerlund, M.; Huseby, S.; Zingone, A.; Landfald, B.",WOS:000302299400006,"Degerlund, M., M.","Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/plankt/fbs004,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Bacillariophyceae,NULL,NULL,"functional diversity, cryptic diversity, cosmopolitan, species concept, diatoms",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Within the nominal species <i>A. taxiformis</i>, previous molecular analyses have uncovered several lineages, suggesting the existence of sister species or subspecies. Although the genus has been well studied in some regions (e.g., the Mediterranean Sea and Hawaii), it remains poorly investigated in others (e.g., South Pacific). Our study mainly focused on these latter areas to clarify lineages and better determine lineage status (i.e., native vs. introduced). A total of 188 specimens were collected from 61 sites, 58 of which had never been sampled before. We sequenced the DNA from samples for three markers and obtained 112 sequences for the chloroplastic RuBisCo spacer, 118 sequences for the nuclear LSU rRNA gene, and 174 for the mitochondrial spacer cox2-3. Phylogenetic analyses using all three markers suggested the existence of two cryptic sister species with the discovery of a new clade within <i>A. armata</i>.

We also discovered a new, fifth lineage for <i>A. taxiformis </i>restricted to the South Pacific and Western Australia. Except for this newly described lineage, all other lineages showed a global distribution influenced by introduction events. These results illustrate the difficulty in accurately defining cosmopolitan species.

We identify sites with high frequencies of range boundaries using almost 1800 benthic marine invertebrates along the northwestern Atlantic coast and address whether their magnitude and location vary as a function of species’ taxonomy, pelagic larval duration and depth distribution. We observed clusters of species boundaries at Cape Hatteras, Cape Cod and the Bay of Fundy that are largely independent of taxonomic group. However, the boundaries were permeable and asymmetric, with a higher percentage of species shared across boundaries in the equatorward direction (82%) than in the reverse direction (59%). This pattern was particularly strong for shallow species (median occurrence depth < 20 m). Pelagic larval duration was more important to explain distributions of boundaries for deep species (median occurrence depth > 20 m), where species with long larval dispersal had significantly higher occurrence of boundaries than species with short larval dispersal. When they do exist, species boundaries seem to be set by the interaction of currents, depth distribution and pelagic larval duration. Importantly, species boundaries tend to be pinned to regions of reduced water transport, which might explain why species boundaries are concentrated in narrow geographical areas.","Pappalardo, P.; Pringle, J.M.; Wares, J.P.; Byers, J.E.",WOS:000357135900008,"Pappalardo, Paula, P.","Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.01135,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Whether or not these population genetic processes translate to more species at macroevolutionary scales remains contentious [7]. Here we show that lineages with bioluminescent courtship, almost certainly a sexually selected trait, have more species and faster rates of species accumulation than their non-luminous relatives. In each of ten distantly related animal lineages from insects, crustaceans, annelid worms, and fishes, we find more species in lineages with bioluminescent courtship compared to their sister groups. Furthermore, we find under a Yule model that lineages with bioluminescent courtship displays have significantly higher rates of species accumulation compared to a larger clade that includes them plus non-luminous relatives. In contrast, we do not find more species or higher rates in lineages that use bioluminescence for defense, a function presumably not under sexual selection.

The storage and reuse of complex biodiversity data in central databases are becoming increasingly important, particularly in attempts to cope with the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystems. From the data side, the main challenge of biodiversity repositories is to deal with the highly interdisciplinary and heterogeneous character of standardized and unstandardized data and metadata covering information from genes to ecosystems. Furthermore, the technical improvements in data acquisition techniques produce ever larger data volumes, which represent a challenge for database structure and proper data exchange. The current study is based on comprehensive in-depth interviews and an online survey addressing IT specialists involved in database development and operation. The results show that metadata are already well established, but that non-meta data still is largely unstandardized across various scientific communities. For example, only a third of all repositories in our investigation use internationally unified semantic standard checklists for taxonomy. The study also showed that database developers are mostly occupied with the implementation of state of the art technology and solving operational problems, leaving no time to implement user's requirements. One of the main reasons for this dissatisfying situation is the undersized and unreliable funding situation of most repositories, as reflected by the marginally small number of permanent IT staff members. We conclude that a sustainable data management system that fosters the future use and reuse of these valuable data resources requires the development of fewer, but more permanent data repositories using commonly accepted standards for their long-term data. This can only be accomplished through the consolidation of hitherto widely scattered small and non-permanent repositories.","Bach, K.; Schäfer, D.; Enke, N.; Seeger, B.; Gemeinholzer, B.; Bendix, J.",WOS:000308522900003,"Bach, Kerstin, K.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.11.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Biodiversity; Collaborative research projects; Data exchange; Data standards; Long-term data repositories,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Diversity surveys based on environmental DNA (eDNA) have dramatically changed this view by revealing an unexpected diversity of naked and organic-walled lineages as well as detecting foraminiferal lineages in soil and freshwater environments. Moreover, single-cell analyses have allowed discrimination among genetically distinctive types within almost every described morphospecies. In view of these studies, the foraminiferal diversity appeared to be largely underestimated, but its accurate estimation was impeded by the low speed and coverage of a cloning-based eDNA approach. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, these limitations disappeared in favor of exhaustive descriptions of foraminiferal diversity in numerous samples. Yet, the biases and errors identified in early HTS studies raised some questions about the accuracy of HTS data and their biological interpretation. Among the most controversial issues affecting the reliability of HTS diversity estimates are (1) the impact of technical and biological biases, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic sequence assignment, (3) the ability to distinguish rare species, and (4) the quantitative interpretation of HTS data.

Since then, it has remained poorly studied and has been known only from a small number of specimens from relatively deep reef environments in the Red Sea and the Chagos archipelago, northern Indian Ocean. Access to museum collections enabled examination of type material and the recovery of coral skeletons from the Seychelles, Madagascar, and Mayotte, southern Indian Ocean. A recent survey in Mayotte allowed the <i>in situ</i> imaging of <i>Craterastrea</i> in shallow and turbid reef environments and sampling for molecular analyses. The molecular analyses were in agreement with the examination of micromorphology and microstructure of skeletons by revealing that <i>Craterastrea levis</i>, the only species in the genus, differs much from <i>Leptoseris foliosa</i>, with which it was synonymized. Moreover, <i>Craterastrea</i> is closely related to <i>Coscinaraea, Horastrea </i>and <i>Anomastraea/i>. However, these genera, currently ascribed to the Siderastreidae, are genetically distant to <i>Siderastrea</i>, the family's type genus, and <i>Pseudosiderastrea</i>. Hence, we restore the genus <i>Craterastrea</i>, describe the new family Coscinaraeidae due to its deep evolutionary divergence from the Siderastreidae, and provide revised diagnoses of the four genera in the family.

Polychaete annelids, in particular, generally show a high degree of population divergence, especially in mitochondrial genes. Rarely have molecular studies confirmed the presence of ‘cosmopolitan’ species. The amphinomid polychaete <i>Hermodice carunculata</i> was long considered the sole species within its genus, with a reported distribution throughout the Atlantic and adjacent basins. However, recent studies have indicated morphological differences, primarily in the number of branchial filaments, between the East and West Atlantic populations; these differences were invoked to re-instate <i>Hermodice nigrolineata</i>, formerly considered a junior synonym of <i>H. carunculata</i>. We utilized sequence data from two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) markers and one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) marker to examine the genetic diversity of <i>Hermodice</i> throughout its distribution range in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea. Our analyses revealed generally low genetic divergences among collecting localities and between the East and West Atlantic, although phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial data indicate the presence of a private lineage in the Mediterranean Sea. A re-evaluation of the number of branchial filaments confirmed differences between East and West Atlantic populations; however, the differences were not diagnostic and did not reflect the observed genetic population structure. Rather, we suspect that the number of branchial filaments is a function of oxygen saturation in the environment. Our results do not support the distinction between <i>H. carunculata</i> in the West Atlantic and<i> H. nigrolineata </i>in the East Atlantic.

Understanding the drivers of sponge distribution in Antarctica enables us to understand many of general benthic biodiversity patterns in the region. The sponges of the Antarctic and neighbouring oceanographic regions were assessed for species richness and biogeographic patterns using over 8,800 distribution records. Species-rich regions include the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, South Georgia, Eastern Weddell Sea, Kerguelen Plateau, Falkland Islands and north New Zealand. Sampling intensity varied greatly within the study area, with sampling hotspots found at the Antarctic Peninsula, South Georgia, north New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego, with limited sampling in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas in the Southern Ocean. In contrast to previous studies we found that eurybathy and circumpolar distributions are important but not dominant characteristics in Antarctic sponges. Overall Antarctic sponge species endemism is ∼43%, with a higher level for the class Hexactinellida (68%). Endemism levels are lower than previous estimates, but still indicate the importance of the Polar Front in isolating the Southern Ocean fauna. Nineteen distinct sponge distribution patterns were found, ranging from regional endemics to cosmopolitan species. A single, distinct Antarctic demosponge fauna is found to encompass all areas within the Polar Front, and the sub-Antarctic regions of the Kerguelen Plateau and Macquarie Island. Biogeographical analyses indicate stronger faunal links between Antarctica and South America, with little evidence of links between Antarctica and South Africa, Southern Australia or New Zealand.

Mixotrophic dinoflagellates follow photoautotrophic diatoms but precede their obligate heterotrophic counterparts in the succession because of the relative advantages afforded by photosynthesizing when light and nutrients are available in spring. The mean cell size of the sampled diatoms is smallest in the summer, likely because of the higher specific nutrient affinity of smaller relative to larger cells. Contrastingly, we hypothesize that mixotrophy diminishes the size selection based on nutrient limitation and accounts for the lack of a seasonal size shift among surveyed dinoflagellates. Relatively small, heterotrophic dinoflagellates (µg C cell<sup>−1</sup> < 10<sup>−3</sup>) peak after other, larger dinoflagellates, in part because of the increased abundance of their small prey during nutrient-deplete summer months. The largest surveyed diatoms (µg C cell<sup>−1</sup> > 10<sup>−2</sup>) bloom later than others, and we hypothesize that this may be because of their relatively slow maximum potential growth rates and high internal nutrient storage, as well as to the slower predation of these larger cells.

There is evidence that seagrass extent continues to decline, but there is little understanding of the potential impacts of this decline. We used a seagrass residency index,  that was trait and evidence based, to estimate the proportion of Mediterranean commercial fishery landings values and recreation fisheries total expenditure that can be attributed to seagrass during different life stages. The index was calculated as a weighted sum of the averages of the estimated residence time in seagrass (compared with other habitats) at each life stage of the fishery species found in seagrass. Seagrass-associated species were estimated to contribute 30%–40% to the value of commercial fisheries landings and approximately 29% to recreational fisheries expenditure. These species predominantly rely on seagrass to survive juvenile stages. Seagrass beds had an estimated direct annual contribution during residency of €58–91 million (4% of commercial landing values) and €112 million (6% of recreation expenditure) to commercial and recreational fisheries, respectively, despite covering <2% of the area.

To fill this gap, we initiated the Foram Barcoding (FB) project, whose objective is to create a curated molecular database for modern foraminifera. Each species included in our database is represented by one or several specimens, from which DNA was extracted and sequenced. Species entries include photos of processed specimens, taxonomic references, and DNA barcode sequences. A fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, commonly used in foraminiferal molecular studies, was chosen as the DNA barcode. We believe that the FB project will help resolve at least some misidentification problems that plague foraminiferal taxonomy. We also foresee its further applications in such domains of foraminiferal research as diversity assessment, ecology, biogeography, and biomonitoring. However, we are aware that the impact of the FB database depends mainly on its completeness and accuracy, and thus we appeal to the community of foraminiferologists to support this project by providing material for genetic studies and by contributing their taxonomic expertise in species identification and documentation.","Pawlowski, J.; Holzmann, M.",WOS:000330096100006,"Pawlowski, Jan, J.","Univ Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2113/gsjfr.44.1.62,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Large differences among databases were found which are partially explained by variations in their taxonomical, environmental, and geographical scopes but also by the variable efforts for continuous updates and by inconsistencies on the definition of “alien” or “invasive” species.

The Singaporean and Chinese surimi contained principally species of low trophic levels, like fringe scale sardines <i>Sardinella fimbriata</i> and other, likely farmed, species such as striped catfish <i>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</i>. The presence of low trophic level and aquaculture species suggests that current trends in surimi production are moving towards sustainability. The exception was a vulnerable shovelnose ray (<i>Rhinobatos jimbaranensis</i>) found in one product, which encourages further studies to detect the use of endangered species in such morphologically indistinct food items.

We review available data on distribution and community ecology to assess the functional role of <i>Idotea</i>in the Baltic Sea and how global change may affect essential ecological interactions. Data from the last 150 years suggest an on-going shift southward for <i>I. chelipes</i> and <i>I. granulosa</i> that may be caused by a changing climate. Several studies report local extinctions and mass abundances, which may be caused by a changing food web from over-fishing and eutrophication. The three species of <i>Idotea</i> have clear habitat segregation in the Baltic Sea, where salinity, temperature and vegetation are the main dimensions. <i>Idotea</i> spp. have a central role as grazers and in communities dominated by the perennial macrophytes <i>Fucus</i> spp. and <i>Zostera marina</i> and attain impressive feeding rates on a range of epiphytes/filamentous algae (top-down effect). <i>Idotea</i> can have both a direct negative grazing effect on macrophytes but also an indirect positive effect by removing epiphytes. The relative role of nutritional value and chemical defence for food preference is yet unclear for <i>Idotea</i>. Baltic idoteids are also important prey for several fish (bottom-up effect) and fish predation may have increased following overfishing of piscivorous fish. It is concluded that <i>Idotea</i> is a key taxon in the Baltic Sea food web, where guilds often contain few dominant species. Changes in population dynamics of <i>Idotea</i>, as a function of human generated global change, may have large-scale consequences for ecosystem functions in a future Baltic Sea, e.g. the extent of vegetation cover in the coastal zone.","Leidenberger, S.; Jonsson, P.R.; Harding, K.C.",WOS:000304839800003,"Jonsson, Per, P.R.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1163/193724012x626485,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,Idotea,NULL,NULL,"Baltic Sea, distribution patterns, environmental changes, Idotea, key species",Journal article,NULL,NULL

All methods, whether based on past rates of species descriptions, on expert opinion, on the fraction of undescribed species in samples collected, or on ratios between taxa in the taxonomic hierarchy, suffer the same limitation. Here we show that infaunal macrofauna (crustaceans and polychaetes) of the lower bathyal depth range are underrepresented among available data and documented results from Australia. The crustacean and polychaete fauna (only partially identified) of the bathyal continental margin of Western Australia comprised 805 species, representing a largely novel and endemic fauna. Overall, 94.6% of crustacean species were undescribed, while 72% of polychaete species were new to the Australian fauna, including all tanaidaceans, amphipods, and cumaceans, as well as most isopods. Most species were rare, and the species accumulation rate showed no sign of reaching an asymptote with increasing area sampled. Similar data are likely for the largely unexplored bathyal regions. This leads us to conclude that the numbers upon which extrapolations to larger areas are based are too low to provide confidence. The Southern Australian and Indo-West Pacific deep-sea regions contribute significantly to global species diversity. These regions and bathyal and abyssal habitats generally are extensive, but are so-far poorly sampled. They appear to be dominated by taxonomically poorly worked and species-rich taxa with limited distributions. The combination of high species richness among infaunal taxa—compared to better known taxa with larger individuals, higher endemism than presently acknowledged because of the presence of cryptic species, the low proportion of described species in these taxa, and the vast extent of unexplored bathyal and abyssal environments—will lead to further accumulation of new species as more and more deep sea regions are explored. It remains to be tested whether ratios of 10 or more undescribed to described species, found in this study for the dominant taxa and for the deep Southern Ocean and the Indo-West Pacific, are replicable in other areas. Our data and similar figures from other remote regions, and the lack of faunal overlap, suggest that Appeltans et al.’s (Current Biology 22:1–14, 2012) estimate that between one-third and two-thirds of the world’s marine fauna is undescribed is low, and that Mora et al.’s (PLoS Biol 9(8):e1001127. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127, 2011) of 91% is more probable.

Parasite Co-occurrence Modeler (PaCo) is a tool for identifying a list of parasites known from fish species that are similar ecologically, phylogenetically, and geographically to the host of interest. PaCo uses data from FishBase (maximum length, growth rate, life span, age at maturity, trophic level, phylogeny, and biogeography) to estimate compatibility between a target host and parasite species–genera from the major helminth groups (Acanthocephala, Cestoda, Monogenea, Nematoda, and Trematoda). Users can include any combination of host attributes in a model. These unique features make PaCo an innovative tool for addressing both theoretical and applied questions in parasitology. In addition to predicting the occurrence of parasites, PaCo can be used to investigate how host characteristics shape parasite communities. To test the performance of the PaCo algorithm, we created 12,400 parasite lists by applying any possible combination of model parameters (248) to 50 fish hosts. We then measured the relative importance of each parameter by assessing their frequency in the best models for each host. Host phylogeny and host geography were identified as the most important factors, with both present in 88% of the best models. Habitat (64%) was identified in more than half of the best models.

Taxonomic diversity of the fish fauna is considered and its characteristics for belonging to a geographical area and biotopical groups of fish are given. For the ratio of species, genera, and families, the fish fauna of the Chukchi Sea is significantly more diverse than that of the other Arctic seas, including the Barents Sea, and demonstrates a certain similarity for these indicators with the fish fauna of the western Bering Sea. Fish communities of the Chukchi Sea are dominated by Cottidae, Zoarcidae, Pleuronectidae, Stichaeidae, Agonidae, and Salmonidae, constituting a total of 73 species, or 66.4% of the species diversity. Benthic fishes of elittoral and sublittoral complexes dominate in terms of the biotopic belonging (74 species, 67.2%); arctic, arctic-boreal, and Pacific and Asiatic boreal species (89 species, 80.9%) dominate in terms of the zoogeographic belonging. Information availability for the bioresource potential of the Chukchi Sea is insufficient: fishing is not carried out or there are no accessible data on it. Most of the fish fauna of the Chukchi Sea (68 species or 61.8% of species diversity) consists of rare species.

This study examines shell bead production, use, and discard in relation to site function and the diversity of on-site human activities. Four factors are expected to contribute to variation in the ornament assemblages, one environmental and three behavioral. The behavioral factors relate to winnowing for quality as a function of distance from the raw material source, changes in the size of user groups, and symbol standardization. The accumulation rates for shell beads, bones, and stone tools paralleled one another through time, indicating that ornament discard followed the pulse of daily life at this site. All stages of manufacture and use are well represented in each assemblage, and half or more of the ornaments show evidence of extended use. Changes in the local marine environment do not explain much of the variation in the assemblages, pointing instead to behavioral causes. The richness of shell types that were collected as raw material correlates to greater exploitation of edible marine shellfish and greater occupation intensity. Much of this variation in the ornament raw material was eliminated during the manufacture stage, almost certainly reflecting the influence of cultural norms. A focus on basket-shaped shells changed remarkably little over thousands of years, despite significant changes in other domains of technology. This last result suggests that beads were the most irreducible and conservative elements of more complex design traditions.","Stiner, M.C.; Kuhn, S.L.; Güleç, E.",WOS:000320075700006,"Stiner, Mary, M.C.",NULL,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.01.008,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Shell ornaments, Zooarchaeology, Taphonomy, Technological experiments, Üçagizli",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Current knowledge on the response of benthic communities to the impact of trawling is still rudimentary. In the present study, we used data collected in the Barents Sea during 2011 to assess the vulnerability of benthic species to trawling, based on the risk of being caught or damaged by a bottom trawl. Using trait table analysis, we identified 23 “high-risk” benthic species, which include “large weight and upraised” taxa as “easily caught” by a bottom trawl. We further identified a “low-risk” category containing 245 taxa/species and a “medium-risk” category with 80 species. A clear decline in biomass was noted for all three categories when comparing trawled vs. untrawled areas. This suggests that trawling significantly affects the biomass of all species, but predominantly the “high-risk” taxa. Some Barents Sea regions were particularly susceptible to trawling due to the dominance of the “high-risk” species, including <i>Geodia </i>sponges in the southwestern Barents Sea, basket stars ( <i>Gorgonocephalus</i> ) in the northern Barents Sea, sea pen (<i> Umbellula encrinus</i> ) on the shelf facing the Arctic Ocean, and sea cucumber ( <i>Cucumaria frondosa</i> ) in shallow southern areas. These findings can guide management decisions to meet targets set by the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity and the OSPAR Commission (“Protecting and Conserving the North-East Atlantic and its Resources”).

However, the phylogenetic relationships within and between the genera are unknown or contentious. On the one hand, <i>Alveopora</i>  has been transferred to the Acroporidae recently because it was shown to be more closely related to this family than to the Poritidae by previous molecular studies.

Despite their importance in terms of biodiversity and biomass production, community analyses remain scarce. Actual sampling of these assemblages is complicated to carry out because their depth distribution (down to − 120 m) necessitates complex diving logistics. We highlight a rapid, cost-effective, objective and accurate method for the sampling of coralligenous assemblages and tested its efficiency in delineating a depth gradient. We compared seven photographic methods for estimating the percentage cover of sessile organisms: visual estimates (VS) with the aid of a 25, 64 or 100 square-grid and random-point-quadrats (RQ) with 25, 64 or 100 random points or 64 stratified random points. Comparisons were made using two simulated quadrats for which percent cover values were known. RQ with 64 random points was the method that accumulated the highest number of advantages. Using this method, two field sites were sampled by divers at three depths (− 50, − 60 and − 70 m) with increasing replication (10, 20, 30 and 40 photographic quadrats). The communities deduced from the 30 and 40 photos were similar. Community analyses showed an effect of depth nested in site on the assemblages observed. With increasing depth, encrusting algae get replaced by Porifera. Dissimilarity between − 50 m and − 60 m/− 70 m was mainly due to <i>Crambe tailliezi</i> abundance. This methodology will be a useful tool for managers and administrators; it guarantees fast abundance estimation, non-destructive repeated sampling, the possibility of comparison among researchers and the permanent record of deep-sea communities.","Deter, J.; Boissery, P.",WOS:000304796700009,"Deter, Julie, J.","OEil Andromede, F-34280 Carnon, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2012.03.006,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Benthic organisms, CPCe, Hard bottom assemblage, Photographic quadrat, Rocky habitat, Sampling technique",Journal article,NULL,NULL

Phylogenetics and systematic of oysters based on morphology have proved difficult because of their high phenotypic plasticity. In this study we explore the phylogenetic information of the DNA sequence and secondary structure of the nuclear, fast-evolving, ITS2 rRNA and the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes from the Ostreidae and we implemented a multi-locus framework based on four loci for oyster phylogenetics and systematics. Sequence-structure rRNA models aid sequence alignment and improved accuracy and nodal support of phylogenetic trees. In agreement with previous molecular studies, our phylogenetic results indicate that none of the currently recognized subfamilies, Crassostreinae, Ostreinae, and Lophinae, is monophyletic. Single gene trees based on Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) methods and on sequence-structure ML were congruent with multilocus trees based on a concatenated (ML and BA) and coalescent based (BA) approaches and consistently supported three main clades: (i) <i>Crassostrea</i>, (ii)<i> Saccostrea</i>, and (iii) an Ostreinae-Lophinae lineage. Therefore, the subfamily Crassotreinae (including <i>Crassostrea</i>), Saccostreinae subfam. nov. (including <i>Saccostrea</i> and tentatively <i>Striostrea</i>) and Ostreinae (including Ostreinae and Lophinae taxa) are recognized. Based on phylogenetic and biogeographical evidence the Asian species of <i>Crassostrea</i> from the Pacific Ocean are assigned to <i>Magallana</i> gen. nov., whereas an integrative taxonomic revision is required for the genera <i>Ostrea</i> and <i>Dendostrea</i>. This study pointed out the suitability of the ITS2 marker for DNA barcoding of oyster and the relevance of using sequence-structure rRNA models and features of the ITS2 folding in molecular phylogenetics and taxonomy. The multilocus approach allowed inferring a robust phylogeny of Ostreidae providing a broad molecular perspective on their systematics.","Salvi, D.; Macali, A.; Mariottini, P.",WOS:000342492700150,"Salvi, Daniele, D.","Univ Porto, InBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO, Vairao, Portugal.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0108696,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Journal article,NULL,NULL

Most NIS reported in the current inventory are native in the Indo-Pacific region. Fouling and ballast water are the most likely introduction vectors of NIS in the studied area but shipping routes connecting to the NIS native regions are rare, indicating that most species are secondary introductions.

A database detailing the parks from which each resource was harvested and its purpose(s) was compiled, representing the most comprehensive list of resources harvested from parks to date. A total of 382 harvested biological and abiotic resources (284 terrestrial and 98 aquatic), used for a wide range of purposes, were identified across parks. Many of the resources, especially animals (96%), were harvested destructively. The strongest motivation for harvest was subsistence, although most resources were also used for financial gain through informal business. Although current data are not sufficient to determine harvest sustainability for most resources, better data and increased awareness of resource use activities will enable future research to this end.","Van Wilgen, N.J.; Dopolo, M.; Symonds, A.; McGeoch, M.A.",WOS:000321300700005,"Van Wilgen, Nicola, N.J.","South African Natl Pk, Cape Res Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.4102/koedoe.v55i1.1096,NULL,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,biodiversity; conservation and development; monitoring; protected area management; resource use; sustainable harvest,Journal article,NULL,NULL
