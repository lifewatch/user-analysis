Removal of larger predators through fishing is often suggested to have positive flow-on effects for some lower trophic groups, in which case protection from fishing should result in suppression of lower trophic groups as predator populations recover. We tested this by assessing differences in the trophic structure of reef fish communities associated with 79 MPAs and open-access sites worldwide, using a standardised quantitative dataset on reef fish community structure. The biomass of all major trophic groups (higher carnivores, benthic carnivores, planktivores and herbivores) was significantly greater (by 40% - 200%) in effective no-take MPAs relative to fished open-access areas. This effect was most pronounced for individuals in large size classes, but with no size class of any trophic group showing signs of depressed biomass in MPAs, as predicted from higher predator abundance. Thus, greater biomass in effective MPAs implies that exploitation on shallow rocky and coral reefs negatively affects biomass of all fish trophic groups and size classes. These direct effects of fishing on trophic structure appear stronger than any top down effects on lower trophic levels that would be imposed by intact predator populations. We propose that exploitation affects fish assemblages at all trophic levels, and that local ecosystem function is generally modified by fishing.","Soler, G.A.; Edgar, G.J.; Thomson, R.J.; Kininmonth, S.; Campbell, S.J.; Dawson, T.P.; Barrett, N.S.; Bernard, A.T.F.; Galván, D.E.; Willis, T.J.; Alexander, T.J.; Stuart-Smith, R.D.",WOS:000362962300076,"Stuart-Smith, Rick, R.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0140270,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,"Environmental Management, ""Environmental Managers &amp; Monitoring"", ""Exploitable Scientific Result"", ""Fisheries"", ""Fisheries Management"", ""Policy Makers / Decision Makers"", ""Scientific Community"", ""Scientific Publication""",,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Indonesian coral reefs, located within the so-called “coral triangle”, are among the richest in the world. However, the knowledge of the diversity of sponges and several other marine taxa is far from being complete in the area. In spite of this great biodiversity, most of the information on Indonesian sponges is scattered in old and fragmented literature and comprehensive data about their diversity are still lacking. In this paper, we report the presence of 94 species recorded during different research campaigns mainly from the Marine Park of Bunaken, North Sulawesi. Six species are new for science and seven represent new records for the area. Several others are very poorly known species, sometimes recorded for the second time after their description. For most species, besides field data and detailed descriptions, pictures in vivo are included. Moreover, two new symbiotic sponge associations are described.  This work aims to increase the basic knowledge of Indonesian sponge diversity as a prerequisite for monitoring and conservation of this valuable taxon.

Here, we characterize the sensitivity of the Puget Sound ecosystem to ocean acidification by estimating, at a number of taxonomic levels, the direct sensitivity of its species. We compare sensitivity estimates based on species mineralogy and on published literature from laboratory experiments and field studies. We generated information on the former by building a database of species in Puget Sound with mineralogy estimates for all CaCO<sub>3</sub>-forming species. For the latter, we relied on a recently developed database and meta-analysis on temperate species responses to increased CO<sub>2</sub>. In general, species sensitivity estimates based on the published literature suggest that calcifying species are more sensitive to increased CO<sub>2 </sub>than non-calcifying species. However, this generalization is incomplete, as non-calcifying species also show direct sensitivity to high CO<sub>2 </sub>conditions. We did not find a strong link between mineral solubility and the sensitivity of species survival to changes in carbonate chemistry, suggesting that, at coarse scales, mineralogy plays a lesser role to other physiological sensitivities. Summarizing species sensitivity at the family level resulted in higher sensitivity scalar scores than at the class level, suggesting that grouping results at the class level may overestimate species sensitivity. This result raises caution about the use of broad generalizations on species response to ocean acidification, particularly when developing summary information for specific locations. While we have much to learn about species response to ocean acidification and how to generalize ecosystem response, this study on Puget Sound suggests that detailed information on species performance under elevated carbon dioxide conditions, summarized at the lowest taxonomic level possible, is more valuable than information on species mineralogy.","Busch, S.; McElhany, P.",WOS:000410505800001,"Busch, Shallin, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1525/elementa.245,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Puget Sound; calcium carbonate mineralogy; Ocean acidification; ecosystem-based management; global change; species inventory    ,Journal article,,,"NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Mukilteo, WA 98275 USA.",USA,,OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; CORAL,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Conservation Biology Division - Northwest Fisheries Science Center,,USA,,Research institute,Science

This review aims to provide an enhanced understanding of these protists with a particular emphasis on their taxonomy, ecology and biotechnology applications. Over the years, thraustochytrid taxonomy has improved with the development of modern molecular techniques and new biochemical markers, resulting in the isolation and description of new strains. In the present work, the taxonomic history of thraustochytrids is reviewed, while providing an up-to-date classification of these organisms. It also describes the various biomarkers that may be taken into consideration to support taxonomic characterization of the thraustochytrids, together with a review of traditional and modern techniques for their isolation and molecular identification. The originality of this review lies in linking taxonomy and ecology of the thraustochytrids and their biotechnological applications as producers of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), carotenoids, exopolysaccharides and other compounds of interest. The paper provides a summary of these aspects while also highlighting some of the most important recent studies in this field, which include the diversity of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in thraustochytrids, some novel strategies for biomass production and recovery of compounds of interest. Furthermore, a detailed overview is provided of the direct and current applications of thraustochytrid-derived compounds in the food, fuel, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and aquaculture industries and of some of the commercial products available.

Sea dumped munitions are able to contaminate the surroundings because of the release of explosive chemicals due to corrosion and breaching or by detonation after blast-operations. This implies the risk of accumulation of toxic compounds in human and wildlife food chains. With the help of divers, we performed an active biomonitoring study with transplanted blue mussels (<i>M. edulis</i>) in a burdened area (Kolberger Heide, Germany) with explosive compounds near blast craters over an exposure time of 93 days. With this biomonitoring system, we could show that blue mussels accumulate 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) in their tissues. In all mussels deployed at the ground, we found a body burden with 2-ADNT of 103.75 ± 12.77 ng/g wet weight and with 4-ADNT of 131.31 ± 9.53 ng/g wet weight. TNT itself has been found in six mussels with an average concentration of 31.04 ± 3.26 ng/g mussel wet weight. In the mussels positioned at one meter above the ground no TNT nor 2-ADNT could be detected, but 4-ADNT was found in all samples with an average concentration of 8.71 ± 2.88 ng/g mussel wet weight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using blue mussels <i>M. edulis</i> as an active biomonitoring system for TNT and its metabolites 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT in a free field experiment in a burdened area.

Observations from two contrasting sites (muddy and sandy) in the Celtic Sea in otherwise comparable hydrographic conditions were considered, with the focus on the benthic system. A standard model parameterisation with site-specific light and nutrient adjustments was used, along with modifications to the within-seabed diffusivity to accommodate the modelling of permeable (sandy) sediments. Differences between modelled and observed quantities of organic carbon in the bed were interpreted to suggest that a large part (&gt;90%) of the observed benthic organic carbon is biologically relatively inactive. Evidence on the rate at which this inactive fraction is produced will constitute important information to quantify offshore carbon sequestration. Total oxygen uptake and oxic layer depths were within the range of the measured values. Modelled depth average pore water concentrations of ammonium, phosphate and silicate were typically 5–20% of observed values at the muddy site due to an underestimate of concentrations associated with the deeper sediment layers. Model agreement for these nutrients was better at the sandy site, which had lower pore water concentrations, especially deeper in the sediment. Comparison of pore water nitrate with observations had added uncertainty, as the results from process studies at the sites indicated the dominance of the anammox pathway for nitrogen removal; a pathway that is not included in the model. Macrofaunal biomasses were overestimated, although a model run with increased macrofaunal background mortality rates decreased macrofaunal biomass and improved agreement with observations. The decrease in macrofaunal biomass was compensated by an increase in meiofaunal biomass such that total oxygen demand remained within the observed range. The permeable sediment modification reproduced some of the observed behaviour of oxygen penetration depth at the sandy site. It is suggested that future development in ERSEM benthic modelling should focus on: (1) mixing and degradation rates of benthic organic matter, (2) validation of benthic faunal biomass against large scale spatial datasets, (3) incorporation of anammox in the benthic nitrogen cycle, and (4) further developments to represent permeable sediment processes.","Aldridge, J.N.; Lessin, G.; Amoudry, L.O.; Hicks, N.; Hull, T.; Klar, J.K.; Kitidis, V.; McNeill, C.L.; Ingels, J.; Parker, E.R.; Silburn, B.; Silva, T.; Sivyer, D.B.; Smith, H.E.K.; Widdicombe, S.; Woodward, E.M.S.",WOS:000410456400009,"Widdicombe, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10533-017-0367-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biogeochemistry, ""Modelling""",,Celtic sea; Benthic; Permeable sediments ,Journal article,,,"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England.",England,Biogeochemistry; Modelling; Celtic Sea; Benthic; Permeable sediments,ORGANIC-MATTER; OXYGEN-UPTAKE; ECOSYSTEM; WATER; DENITRIFICATION; DEGRADATION; DEPOSITION; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENTS; DYNAMICS,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,"CEFAS (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science)",x,UK,,Research institute,Science

Using modern reef coral distributions we developed a geographically explicit model of sea surface temperatures. Applying this model to coral occurrence data of the LIG provides a latitudinal U-shaped pattern of temperature anomalies with cooler than modern temperatures around the equator and warmer subtropical climes.

Copepods are one of the major food sources of the ecosystem, yet little is known about the movement patterns of this benthic meiofaunal group within both sediment and water column in the intertidal environment, where they would be more vulnerable for predation. The diversity and abundance of harpacticoids emerging and recolonizing intertidal sand flats were investigated during two diurnal and two nocturnal high tides, using specifically designed traps. Our study revealed no significant difference in the amount of copepods emerging from the sediment into the water column during the day and the night. Furthermore, the proportion of emerging adults and copepodids did not differ from each other and most individuals persisted in the sediment during high tide. Interestingly, the most abundant species <i>Arenosetella tenuissima</i> and <i>Tachidius discipes</i> showed an opposite emergence behavior, with the former migrating in higher numbers during the night and the latter during the day.Although tidal inundation was the proximate factor initiating emergence, we suggest that sediment reworking by tidal currents, waves and bioturbation as well as water and food availability above and within the sediment may be additional factors controlling emergence of harpacticoids in the Wadden Sea, with light intensity playing a minor role.Therefore, emergence and recolonization patterns of harpacticoids from subtidal ecosystems cannot directly be transferred to intertidal areas as the time for benthic pelagic processes is limited to high tides.","Segelken-Voigt, A.; Gerdes, K.; Wehrmann, A.; Arbizu, P.M.; Glatzel, T.",WOS:000430034100006,"Gerdes, Klaas, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.08.008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biodiversity, ""Dispersal"", ""Diurnal rhythms"", ""Meiofauna"", ""Migration""",,Bentho-pelagic coupling,Journal article,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Carl Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",Germany,Meiofauna; Diurnal rhythm; Migration; Biodiversity; Dispersal; Bentho-pelagic coupling,ACTIVE EMERGENCE; VERTICAL MIGRATION; MEIOFAUNA; SEDIMENT; DISPERSAL; COLONIZATION; ZOOPLANKTON; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; COMMUNITY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg - Institute of Biology & Environmental Sciences,x,,,,

Therefore, living fossils are model organisms to study both long-term and ongoing adaptation and speciation processes. However, many aspects of living fossils evolution and their persistence in the modern world remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major aspects of the evolutionary history of living fossils: cryptic speciation, population genetics, and effective population sizes; using members of the genera <i>Nautilus</i>and <i>Allonautilus</i>as classic examples of true living fossils. For this, we analyzed genome-wide ddRAD-Seq data for all six currently recognized nautiloid species throughout their distribution range. Our analyses identified three major allopatric <i>Nautilus</i>clades: a South Pacific clade, subdivided into three subclades with no signs of admixture between them; a Coral Sea clade, consisting of two genetically distinct populations with significant admixture; and a widespread Indo-Pacific clade, devoid of significant genetic substructure. Within these major clades we detected five <i>Nautilus</i>groups, which likely correspond to five distinct species. With the exception of <i>Nautilus macromphalus</i>, all previously described species are at odds with genome-wide data, testifying to the prevalence of cryptic species among living fossils. Detailed <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analyses further revealed significant genome-wide and locus-specific signatures of selection between species and differentiated populations, which is demonstrated here for the first time in a living fossil. Finally, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulations suggested large effective population sizes, which may explain the low levels of population differentiation commonly observed in living fossils.

This study examines the edible mollusks, gastropods, and crustaceans that figure prominently in a mangrove ecosystem that has emerged as a global conservation priority. Based on interviews and field observations, the species that are consumed are identified, as well as the locations within the ecosystem where they are harvested. Attention is also drawn to the gendered practices that inform collection and preservation. Edible shellfish hold considerable potential for monitoring mangrove ecosystem health, which is increasingly affected by deforestation and rising and acidifying seas. This paper highlights the importance of collaborating with local peoples who have cultural and economic ties to mangrove forests and ethnobiological knowledge about the management of these resources, which are essential for the development of effective conservation strategies.","Carney, J.A.",WOS:000410727400005,"Carney, Judith, J.A.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2993/0278-0771-37.3.440,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Conservation, ""Mangroves""",,edible shellfish; female harvesters; Senegambia,Journal article,,,"Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",USA,edible shellfish; mangroves; female harvesters; conservation; Senegambia,FORESTS; ECOSYSTEMS; GAMBIA; LAND,Anthropology; Biology,Anthropology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,University of California - Los Angeles,,USA,,University,Science

The studies assessing the position of mosasauroids on the squamate evolutionary tree and their origins have long given conflicting results. The phylogenetic relationships within Mosasauroidea, however, have experienced only little changes throughout the last decades. Considering the substantial improvements in the development of phylogenetic methodology that have undergone in recent years, resulting, among others, in numerous alterations in the phylogenetic hypotheses of other fossil amniotes, we test the robustness in our understanding of mosasauroid beginnings and their evolutionary history. We re-examined a data set that results from modifications assembled in the course of the last 20 years and performed multiple parsimony analyses and Bayesian tip-dating analysis. Following the inferred topologies and the ‘weak spots’ in the phylogeny of mosasauroids, we revise the nomenclature of the ‘traditionally’ recognized mosasauroid clades, to acknowledge the overall weakness among branches and the alternative topologies suggested previously, and discuss several factors that might have an impact on the differing phylogenetic hypotheses and their statistical support.","Madzia, D.; Cau, A.",WOS:000410726200003,"Madzia, Daniel, D.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Paleobiol, Warsaw, Poland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.3782,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mosasauroidea,Phylogeny,,Parsimony analysis; Bayesian inference; Phylogenetic nomenclature; Fossilized birth-death model; Late Cretaceous,Journal article,,,"Geol & Paleontol Museum G Capellini, Bologna, Italy.",Italy,Mosasauroidea; Phylogeny; Parsimony analysis; Bayesian inference; Phylogenetic nomenclature; Fossilized birth-death model; Late Cretaceous,IDENTIFYING UNSTABLE TAXA; MISSING DATA; SQUAMATA-MOSASAURIDAE; CRETACEOUS PHOSPHATES; INCOMPLETE TAXA; REDESCRIPTION; REPTILIA; HALISAURUS; OUTGROUP; POSITION,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN),,Poland,,University,Science

Recent studies have claimed that rather than the generally accepted date of ~3 million years ago (Ma), the Isthmus was effectively complete by the middle Miocene, 13 Ma. We present a fossil calibrated phylogeny of the new world sand dollar genus Encope, based on one nuclear and four mitochondrial genes, calibrated with fossils at multiple nodes. Present day distributions of <i>Encope</i> are likely the result of multiple range contractions and extinction events. Most species are now endemic to a single region, but one widely distributed species in each ocean is composed of morphotypes previously described as separate species. The most recent separation between eastern Pacific and Caribbean extant clades occurred at 4.90 Ma, indicating that the Isthmus of Panama allowed genetic exchange until the Pliocene. The rate of evolution of mitochondrial genes in Encope has been ten times slower than in the closely related genera <i>Mellita</i> and <i>Lanthonia</i>. This large difference in rates suggests that splits between eastern Pacific and Caribbean biota, dated on the assumption of a “universal” mitochondrial DNA clock are not valid.","Coppard, S.E.; Lessios, H.A.",WOS:000410739000018,"Coppard, Simon, S.E.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Box 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-017-11875-w,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Hamilton Coll, Dept Biol, 198 Coll Hill Rd, Clinton, NY 13323 USA.",USA,,MIDDLE MIOCENE; METABOLIC-RATE; FOSSIL RECORD; BODY-SIZE; ECHINOIDEA; SPECIATION; CLOCK; CLYPEASTEROIDA; PHYLOGENIES; DIVERGENCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI),,,,,

But, they are also vulnerable to human activities, because they are long-lived, grow slowly and have a low resistance. CWC habitat development, due to their steep topography, complex hydrodynamics and substrate heterogeneity. In the Bay of Biscay, which margin is incised by hundreds of canyons, CWCs are known to exist since the late 19th century, but their distribution, and three locations between adjacent canyons were visited with an ROV and a towed camera system during 46 dives on 7 cruises. Images were analyzed for CWC habitats using the CoralFISH classification system. In these habitats, corals, associated fauna were identified and substrate cover measured. Litter was identified in 15 out of 24 canyons.Eleven coral habitats constructed by 62 coral morphotypes were observed in the canyons of the Bay of Biscay hosting 191 associated megafaunal morphotypes, including 160 unique morphotypes. The distribution patterns at regional and local scales could be linked to hydrodynamics and sedimentary regimes. Substrate type was an important driver for coral and associated faunal assemblages, distinguishing biogenic, hard substrate and soft substrate habitats. Coral assemblages were similar between biogenic and hard substrate habitats, but the associated fauna was more abundant and diverse on biogenic habitats. The alpha, beta and gamma diversity were surprisingly high on soft substrates, equals or exceeding that of biogenic habitats.Marine litter was abundant and was mainly composed of plastic items and fishing gear. Litter could co-occur with CWCs and impact them: litter and most CWC habitats were observed at similar water depths and were more abundant in areas with a seafloor relief created by biological or geological features.

One top-down approach to this challenge is to elucidate trophic roles of consumers as either specialists (i.e., consumers of predominantly one food resource) or generalists (i.e., consumers of multiple food resources) to categorize the dependence of consumers on each primary producer. At Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, Alaska, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data to quantify trophic redundancy with standard ellipse areas at both the species and trophic guild levels. We also investigated species-level trophic plasticity by analyzing the varying extents that three end-members were assimilated by the food web using the mixing model simmr (Stable Isotope Mixing Model in R). Our results showed that ice algae, a combined phytoplankton and sediment organic matter composite (PSOM), and a hypothesized microphytobenthos (MPB) component were incorporated by consumers in the benthic food web, but their importance varied by species. Some primary consumers relied heavily on PSOM (e.g, the amphipods <i>Ampelisca</i> sp. and <i>Byblis</i> sp.; the copepod <i>Calanus</i> sp.), while others exhibited generalist feeding and obtained nutrition from multiple sources (e.g., the holothuroidean <i>Ocnus glacialis</i>, the gastropod <i>Tachyrhynchus</i> sp., the sipunculid <i>Golfingia margaritacea</i>, and the bivalves <i>Ennucula tenuis, Nuculana pernula, Macoma</i> sp., and <i>Yoldia hyperborea</i>). Most higher trophic level benthic predators, including the gastropods <i>Buccinum</i> sp., <i>Cryptonatica affinis</i>, and <i>Neptunea</i> sp, the seastar <i>Leptasterias groenlandica</i>, and the amphipod <i>Anonyx</i> sp. also exhibited trophic plasticity by coupling energy pathways from multiple primary producers including PSOM, ice algae, and MPB. Our stable isotope data indicate that consumers in the Hanna Shoal food web exhibit considerable trophic redundancy, while few species were specialists and assimilated only one end-member. Although most consumers were capable of obtaining nutrition from multiple food sources, the timing, quantity, and quality of ice-mediated primary production may still have pronounced effects on food web structure.","McTigue, N.D.; Dunton, K.H.",WOS:000413800300014,"McTigue, N.D.","Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.08.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Chubut,,Food webs,,Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes; simmr; SIBER; Stable isotope mixing models; Chukchi Sea; Trophic redundancy; Trophic plasticity; Trophic guilds ,Journal article,,,"NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.",USA,Food webs; Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes; simmr; SIBER; Stable isotope mixing models; Chukchi Sea; Trophic redundancy; Trophic plasticity; Trophic guilds,STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-MATTER; BERING-SEA; ARCTIC-OCEAN; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; BENTHIC MICROALGAE; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; CARBON ISOTOPES; FATTY-ACID; ICE ALGAE,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Texas at Austin,,,,,

Shell deposits are ubiquitous along the eastern African coast and offshore islands, with previous archaeological research highlighting the prevalence of these deposits in conjunction with providing some discussion on the variable contribution or role of molluscs within the economy. In general, marine molluscs have been viewed as a secondary or fall-back resource with largely opportunistic harvesting in the intertidal zone. In addition, there is a general expectation that there would be significant variability in exploitation depending on settlement structure, the availability of domesticates, and with status differences. With few exceptions, however, the scale and resolution of archaeomalacological analyses across the broader region have tended to be relatively coarse, making it difficult to adequately assess these interpretations. Here we consider these issues based on detailed analyses of the sites of Unguja Ukuu and Fukuchani situated on the island of Unguja (Zanzibar), providing an assessment of the relative importance of the exploited taxa and ecological niches, in combination with species richness and diversity. These analyses provide a comparative framework for other sites in the region, and a baseline understanding of human interactions with coastal environments through molluscan exploitation.","Faulkner, P.; Harris, M.; Ali, A.K.; Haji, O.; Crowther, A.; Horton, M.C.; Boivin, N.L.",WOS:000432442200006,"Faulkner, Patrick, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.051,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Archaeomalacology; Coastal archaeology; Foraging; Iron age; Subsistence; ; Swahili coast  ,Journal article,,,"Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Archaeol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Australia,Archaeomalacology; Coastal archaeology; Foraging; Iron age; Subsistence; Swahili coast,LARGE SHELL MIDDENS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; TORRES STRAIT; SOUTH-AFRICA; ISLANDS; ECOLOGY; REMAINS; MERIAM; BAY,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,University of Sydney - Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences - Department of Archaeology,x,Australia,,University,Science

With the increase of noncommunicable and infectious diseases threatening public health and a dearth of existing drugs, researchers are constantly in the quest for novel bioactive template compounds from natural products. This mini-review aims at bringing to the limelight of the scientific community the polypharmacological potential of marine natural organic products against common chronic diseases. Key databases were probed for relevant publications geared towards pharmacological properties of marine products. Pathologies targeted correlating with the medicinal properties of marine sponges and seaweeds were grouped into four categories namely; cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and HIV. The possible mechanisms of metabolites isolated from these marine products were also discussed. Callyspongynic acid derived from sponge was found to be both effective as anti-diabetic and antiviral. It was noted that congeneric marine sponges’ unique chemical characteristics depend on their geographical location and environment. Moreover, a seaweed derived-metabolite (fucoidan) was found to be beneficial in the management of obesity on long-term treatment, to have hypoglycemic effect on type 2 diabetes and to act as an anti-cancer agent. The myriad of marine metabolites combined to the global awareness of the undiscovered pharmacological potential of marine organisms could increase the pace of these products entering clinical trials. This mini-review advocates for the exploitation of marine products towards the production of novel therapeutic drugs. In conclusion, it was found that the use of marine derived bioactive products could provide a plethora of alternative strategies for clinical applications.","Fawzi, M.M.; Shannen, M.H.M.",WOS:000410771600005,"Fawzi, Mahomoodallly, M.M.","Univ Mauritius, Dept Hlth Sci, Fac Sci, Reduit, Moka, Mauritius.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2174/1570193x14666170519153355,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Algae, ""Natural products"", ""Seaweeds"", ""Sponges""",,Natural products; Ocean; polypharmacology; ,,,,"Univ Mauritius, Dept Hlth Sci, Fac Sci, Reduit, Moka, Mauritius.",Mauritius,Natural products; sponges; algae; seaweeds; ocean; polypharmacology,ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS; IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; DIETARY FIBER INTAKE; MARINE SPONGES; IN-VITRO; REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; DENDRITIC CELLS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; DC-SIGN,"Chemistry, Organic",Chemistry,University of Mauritius,,Mauritius,,University,Science

Its evolution during the Holocene has been influenced by tectonic activity, catastrophic events and relative sea level changes. The scope of the present paper is to examine the Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes of the coastal areas of Zakynthos Island using a multidisciplinary approach, combining sedimentological and palaeontological data with <sup>14</sup>C and OSL dating from four cores of a maximum depth of ~30 m. The integrated results reveal that sea level and tectonic activity have brought significant modifications in the coastal geomorphic settings of the island during the past ~ 10,000 yr B.P. The depositional environments and the palaeontological biofacies document four main geomorphological evolutionary stages of the island. We identified fully marine and lagoonal deposits with marine influence (before 4100 yr B.P.), as well as brackish and freshwater limnic depositional environments (around 4100 yr B.P. to present). The interpretation of our data indicates that Zakynthos island was separated into two main parts before the middle Neolithic period (around 7500 yr B.P.) with Vasilikos peninsula in the SE being isolated from the main island. The fact that Zakynthos Island was a divided Mediterranean island for a significant period of time in its prehistory is of great importance to understand better the archaeological landscapes of Zakynthos and the other Ionian Islands.","Avramidis, P.; Iliopoulos, G.; Nikolaou, K.; Kontopoulos, N.",WOS:000414881100028,"Avramidis, Pavlos, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.018,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Palaeoenvironments, ""Sediments""",,Landscape archaeology;  Coastal changes;  Vasilikos peninsula; Brackish; Freshwater,Journal article,,,"Univ Patras, Div Gen Marine Geol & Geodynam, Dept Geol, Patras 26504, Greece.",Greece,Palaeoenvironment; Sediments; Landscape archaeology; Coastal changes; Vasilikos peninsula; Brackish; Fresh water,WESTERN GREECE; BLACK-SEA; NW GREECE; SINGLE-ALIQUOT; LEVEL CHANGES; MARINE; EVOLUTION; GEOARCHAEOLOGY; RECONSTRUCTION; PELOPONNESUS,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Paleontology",Physical Geography; Geology; Paleontology,University of Patras - Department of Geology,,Greece,,University,Science

Despite broad knowledge of their global ranges, in some locations, including the state of North Carolina, U.S.A., little is known about the community composition and distribution of native and introduced ascidians. We conducted field surveys at 16 harbors and marinas along the coast of North Carolina (33–35 ºN) and documented the diversity, distribution and relative abundance of all ascidian species. Ascidians were identified using morphological observations and barcode sequencing of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Distribution patterns of native and introduced ascidians were analyzed using presence-absence and relative abundance matrices in relation to latitudinal position (South <i>versus</i> North) and geographic distance among harbors. Finally, we monitored the dynamics of a well-established ascidian community at Wilmington over 1.5 years using photo transects. For each ascidian species, we calculated percent cover and abundance and then related those values to temperature fluctuations using cross-correlation analyses. Overall, we found three introduced, two cryptogenic, and eight native ascidian species. Geographic location and distance between survey sites had no effect on ascidian community composition in terms of presence-absence of species. However, the relative number of individuals per species present at each harbor was significantly related to the distance between sites. The ascidian community at Wilmington (three native, one cryptogenic, and one introduced species) showed some seasonality, with abundance and/or percent cover significantly correlated with temperature values recorded during the same month or a few months beforehand.","Villalobos, S.M.; Lambert, G.; Shenkar, N.; López-Legentil, S.",WOS:000418011300003,"López-Legentil, Susanna, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3391/ai.2017.12.4.03,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Sea-squirt; tunicate; introduced; cryptogenic; United States; biological invasion,Journal article,,,"Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA.",USA,Sea-squirt; tunicate; introduced; cryptogenic; United States; biological invasion,NON-INDIGENOUS ASCIDIANS; STYELA-PLICATA; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; CIONA-INTESTINALIS; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; HARD-SUBSTRATE; GROWTH; PHYLOGENY; INVADER; ECOLOGY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of North Carolina,x,USA,,University,Science

Yet counts of genera or families are used to quantify diversity where species-level data are not available. High frequencies of monotypic genera (~30% of animals) have previously been scrutinized as an artefact of human classification. To test whether Linnean taxonomy conflicts with phylogeny, we compared idealized phylogenetic systematics in silico with real-world data. We generated highly replicated, simulated phylogenies under a variety of fixed speciation/extinction rates, imposed three independent taxonomic sorting algorithms on these clades (2.65 × 108 simulated species) and compared the resulting genus size data with quality-controlled taxonomy of animal groups (2.8 × 105 species). ‘Perfect’ phylogenetic systematics arrives at similar distributions to real-world taxonomy, regardless of the taxonomic algorithm. Rapid radiations occasionally produce a large genus when speciation rates are favourable; however, small genera can arise in many different ways, from individual lineage persistence and/or extinctions creating subdivisions within a clade. The consistency of this skew distribution in simulation and real-world data, at sufficiently large samples, indicates that specific aspects of its mathematical behaviour could be developed into generalized or nomothetic principles of the global frequency distributions of higher taxa. Importantly, Linnean taxonomy is a better-than-expected reflection of underlying evolutionary patterns.","Sigwart, J.D.; Sutton, M.D.; Bennett, K.D.",WOS:000435501600001,"Bennett, K.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlx059,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,birth–death process; genus; Linnean taxonomy; macroevolution; species-within-genus statistics; taxonomic rank,Journal article,,,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Paleontol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",USA,birth-death process; genus; Linnean taxonomy; macroevolution; species-within-genus statistics; taxonomic rank,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; STOCHASTIC-MODELS; TAXONOMIC SURROGACY; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; HIGHER TAXA; EVOLUTIONARY; EXTINCTION; PATTERNS; DIVERSIFICATION,Zoology,Zoology,"University of California, Berkeley",x,USA,,University,Science

Known as troglomorphism, these adaptations bring about striking morphologies across invertebrates and vertebrates from both aquatic and terrestrial cave habitats, and include varying degrees of eye and pigmentation loss, as well as hypertrophy of body appendages and sensorial structures. Employing phylogenetic comparative methods and ancestral character reconstructions on a worldwide data set of a group of annelids, the scale worms (Aphroditiformia), we investigate the behavioural and morphological traits of species living in marine caves in comparison with those species living outside caves. Our work demonstrated that cave scale worms respond similar to arthropods in cave environments, showing a significant elongation of sensory parapodial cirri, while lacking eyes and pigmentation. However, whereas elongation of sensory appendages likely occurred in correlation to cave colonization, eyes were plausibly lost in correlation with specialization and colonization of deep-sea habitats.","Gonzalez, B.C.; Worsaae, K.; Fontaneto, D.; Martínez, A.",WOS:000426596900010,"Fontaneto, Diego, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/zsc.12258,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Adaptation,,hypogean; phylogenetic comparative methods; phylogenetic signal; troglomorphism,Journal article,,,"Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Copenhagen O, Denmark.",Denmark,adaptation; hypogean; phylogenetic comparative methods; phylogenetic signal; troglomorphism,ANCESTRAL CHARACTER STATES; CORONA LAVA TUBE; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; MIXED MODELS; NERILLIDAE ANNELIDA; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; PROTEUS-ANGUINUS; MARINE CAVES; R PACKAGE; ANCHIALINE,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,University of Copenhagen - Department of Biology - Section of Marine Biology,x,Denmark,,Research institute,Science

The first attempt to build underwater mussel farm was made by scientists from the Institute of Fish Resources in Varna (IFR) in 1971. The innovative mussel farm developed by the IFR team in 2010-2012 contributed to update and use the scientific capacity of our marine science in a new and more productive branch of mussel cultivation in the Black Sea. The growth of mussels and reaching of commercial size is directly dependent on their diet and that was the reason for investigation of the environmental conditions in the aquatory of the mussel farm in 2010 – 2012. Mussel shell meal from the farm was tested as food additive in broiler ration and it was found to be favorable in improving the growth indicators. The aim of the study was to establish the impact on productivity and morphological properties of eggs using mussel shell meal as a source of calcium in the diet of laying hens.   ,"Klisarova, D.; Trayanov, T.; Lalev, M.; Petrova, E.; Shtereva, G.; Stoikov, S.; Gerdzhikov, D.; Oblakova, M.; Hristakieva, P.; Ivanova, I.",,"Klisarova, Daniela, D.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

University of Oslo: Oslo.  91 pp.","The present study investigated the impact of organic loading from fish farm waste on the benthic environment surrounding a fish farm, and the organic carbon accumulation in fjord sediments in a Western Norwegian fjord. One sediment core collected 100 m from the fish farm was compared with a control core collected 500 m from the farm. Both cores were radiometrically dated to 1927. Interpretation of depositional environment was done based on grain size distribution analysis. Benthic foraminifera (protists) were utilized to assess the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of the benthic environment in each sample, based on foraminiferal species diversity, foraminiferal assemblage composition and benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates (BFAR). Total organic carbon- and total nitrogen content in the sediments, together with stable C- and N-isotope ratios and C- and O-isotope ratios in the tests of selected foraminiferal species, were used to interpret the source of organic matter in the sediments. Heavy metal concentrations were measured and the sediments classified according to official guidelines for sediment pollution. Stable isotope signals and carbon- and nitrogen content was stable throughout the period since 1927 until present-day in both cores, and showed no evidence for increased organic loading related to fish production. Both cores had C/N-ratios characteristic of marine organic matter in sediments deposited after 1927. Foraminiferal species assemblage compositions reflected naturally different benthic environments in the two cores, and showed no clear response to fish production. EcoQS was ‘good’ in both cores. BFAR in the control core increased since the onset of fish production.","Sjetne, L.B.",,"Sjetne, Lars Birkeland, L.B.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Directly sequencing eDNA from seawater using a shotgun approach resulted in only 0.34% of 22.3 million reads assigning to eukaryotes, highlighting the inefficiency of this method for assessing eukaryotic diversity. In contrast, using ‘tree of life’ (ToL) metabarcoding and 20-fold fewer sequencing reads, we could detect 287 families across the major divisions of eukaryotes. Our data also show that the best performing ‘universal’ PCR assay recovered only 44% of the eukaryotes identified across all assays, highlighting the need for multiple metabarcoding assays to catalogue biodiversity. Lastly, focusing on the fish genus Lethrinus, we recovered intra- and inter-specific haplotypes from seawater samples, illustrating that eDNA can be used to explore diversity beyond taxon identifications.

In other cases, the displacement of native species or economic damages are suspected.","López, E.; Richter, A.",WOS:000412807500003,"López, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s10152-017-0499-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Iberian Peninsula,Polychaeta,,,Non-indigenous; alien; Introduction pathway,Journal article,,,"Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, C Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",Spain,Non-indigenous; Alien; Introduction pathway; Polychaeta; Iberian Peninsula,FICOPOMATUS-ENIGMATICUS FAUVEL; BRANCHIOMMA-BAIRDI MCINTOSH; PARAPRIONOSPIO-COORA WILSON; 1ST RECORD; STREBLOSPIO-GYNOBRANCHIATA; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; POLYDORA-CORNUTA; SOFT-BOTTOM; AEGEAN SEA,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) - Department of Biology - Charles Darwin 2,x,Spain,,University,Science

While shipping operations occupy a prominent and historic role in the maritime world, ships no longer rule the waves alone. The ocean and coastal margins of the world are indeed vast and extensive, but they are increasingly crowded, competitive, and conflicted. And now we are expanding and intensifying traditional ocean industries and adding new exploitive activities to the mix, all in the pursuit of a “blue economy,” whether reasonable or not, sustainable or otherwise. Our uses and abuses of the ocean to date have seriously compromised the very foundations of the ocean and coastal system and led to growing marine environmental degradation and the consequent costs of an underperforming ocean economy, loss of essential ecosystem goods and services (which largely sustain the former), increased use conflicts, and challenging legal questions.","Hildebrand, L.P.; Bellefontaine, N.A.",,"Hildebrand, Lawrence, L.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-62365-8_11,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is, therefore, a clear need for improved methods for gathering and classifying subtidal marine biodiversity data and for setting targets in conservation planning. Here, methods for collecting data for subtidal estuarine habitats and fish and mollusc assemblages were developed and techniques for modelling surrogacy relationships between biological assemblages and abiotic variables were examined. The resulting data were used to assess the relative efficiency of different target-setting approaches in conservation planning, highlighting the benefits that accrue when conservation planning takes underlying biological diversity into consideration.","Davis, T.R.",,"Davis, Thomas Robert, T.R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Challenges with using names to link digital biodiversity information. <i>Biodiversity Data Journal 4</i>: e8080. <a href=""https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.4.e8080"" target=""_blank"">https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.4.e8080</a>","The need for a names-based cyber-infrastructure for digital biology is based on the argument that scientific names serve as a standardized metadata system that has been used consistently and near universally for 250 years. As we move towards data-centric biology, name-strings can be called on to discover, index, manage, and analyze accessible digital biodiversity information from multiple sources. Known impediments to the use of scientific names as metadata include synonyms, homonyms, mis-spellings, and the use of other strings as identifiers. We here compare the name-strings in GenBank, Catalogue of Life (CoL), and the Dryad Digital Repository (DRYAD) to assess the effectiveness of the current names-management toolkit developed by Global Names to achieve interoperability among distributed data sources. New tools that have been used here include Parser (to break name-strings into component parts and to promote the use of canonical versions of the names), a modified TaxaMatch fuzzy-matcher (to help manage typographical, transliteration, and OCR errors), and Cross-Mapper (to make comparisons among data sets). The data sources include scientific names at multiple ranks; vernacular (common) names; acronyms; strain identifiers and other surrogates including idiosyncratic abbreviations and concatenations. About 40% of the name-strings in GenBank are scientific names representing about 400,000 species or infraspecies and their synonyms. Of the formally-named terminal taxa (species and lower taxa) represented, about 82% have a match in CoL. Using a subset of content in DRYAD, about 45% of the identifiers are names of species and infraspecies, and of these only about a third have a match in CoL. With simple processing, the extent of matching between DRYAD and CoL can be improved to over 90%. The findings confirm the necessity for name-processing tools and the value of scientific names as a mechanism to interconnect distributed data, and identify specific areas of improvement for taxonomic data sources. Some areas of diversity (bacteria and viruses) are not well represented by conventional scientific names, and they and other forms of strings (acronyms, identifiers, and other surrogates) that are used instead of names need to be managed in reconciliation services (mapping alternative name-strings for the same taxon together). On-line resolution services will bring older scientific names up to date or convert surrogate name-strings to scientific names should such names exist. Examples are given of many of the aberrant forms of ‘names’ that make their way into these databases. The occurrence of scientific names with incorrect authors, such as chresonyms within synonymy lists, is a quality-control issue in need of attention. We propose a future-proofing solution that will empower stakeholders to take advantage of the name-based infrastructure at little cost. This proposed infrastructure includes a standardized system that adopts or creates UUIDs for name-strings, software that can identify name-strings in sources and apply the UUIDs, reconciliation and resolution services to manage the name-strings, and an annotation environment for quality control by users of name-strings.","Patterson, D.; Mozzherin, D.; Shorthouse, D.; Thessen, A.",WOS:000449618200100,"Thessen, Anne, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.4.e8080,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Data paper,,,"Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Australia,,TAXONOMY; BIOLOGY; HISTORY; TAXA; BIG,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,University of Sydney,x,Australia,,University,Science

To investigate community patterns and food use of the macrozoobenthos, a transect of 11 stations was sampled for species number, abundance and stable isotope values (δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N) of macrozoobenthos and for stable isotope values of potential food resources. The transect was located in the back-barrier system of the island of Spiekeroog (southern North Sea, Germany). Our results show that surface and subsurface deposit feeders, such as <i>Peringia ulvae</i> and different oligochaete species, dominated the community, which was poor in species, while species present at the transect stations reached high abundance. The only exception was the upper salt marsh with low abundances but higher species richness because of the presence of specialized semi-terrestrial and terrestrial taxa. The macrozoobenthos relied predominantly on marine resources irrespective of the locality in the intertidal zone, although δ<sup>13</sup>C values of the consumers decreased from &minus;&#xA0;14.1&#xA0;&plusmn;&#xA0;1.6&permil; (tidal flats) to &minus;&#xA0;21.5&#xA0;&plusmn;&#xA0;2.4&permil; (salt marsh).

It has been suggested that the elements of the structure of the physical environment have fractal properties. If habitat complexity largely determines species diversity this leads to the prediction (for a single perfect fractal) that all organisms, regardless of size, will perceive the environment as equally complex and should have equivalent diversity and, as we move up the size spectrum, species composition should change in a regular and gradual fashion. This study examines the degree to which infaunal assemblage structure varies with mesh size, sample size and sample dispersion within two different areas of homogeneous intertidal sediment, a muddy sand and a coarse sand, in the Isles of Scilly, UK. In each area samples were extracted using a standard range of 5 mesh sizes (63, 125, 250, 500, 1000 μm), with the sample areas and distances between samples scaled to the mesh size. All metazoans were identified to species level. Diversity and species composition did not show a gradual and even degree of change over the size range at either site. Instead, they showed a dramatic stepwise change between the 250 μm and 500 μm mesh size samples, being relatively constant in the < 500 μm and > 500 μm categories, with diversity higher in the former. Higher proportions of species in the < 500 μm categories showed evidence of spatial clustering than in the > 500 μm categories. This suggests a fractal structure within but not between the < 500 μm and > 500 μm body size categories, which apparently is not driven by differences in sediment structure. The biology of marine metazoan benthos does not scale continuously across the full range of taxa and body size as has been recently suggested, but may do so for individual taxa and restricted size ranges.","Somerfield, P.J.; Dashfield, S.L.; Warwick, R.M.",WOS:000430034100016,"Warwick, R.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.08.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Body size, ""Macrobenthos"", ""Meiobenthos"", ""Sampling methods""",,Fractal; diversity,Journal article,,,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",England,Body size; Fractal; Diversity; Sampling methods; Meiobenthos; Macrobenthos,BODY-SIZE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; ASSEMBLAGES; ECOLOGY; DISTRIBUTIONS; MACROBENTHOS; DISTINCTNESS; MEIOBENTHOS; ARTIFACTS,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,PML (Plymouth Marine Laboratory),x,,,,

Inter- and transdisciplinary interactions are, however, vital for: (i) a detailed understanding of the ecological role of marine fungi, (ii) unlocking their hidden potential for natural product discovery, and (iii) designing access routes for biotechnological production. In this review and opinion paper, we describe the two different “worlds” of marine fungal natural product chemists and marine fungal molecular ecologists.

World Register of Marine Cave Species: a tool for investigating meiofaunal diversity in marine and anchialine subterranean systems. World Register of Marine Cave Species (WoRCS): [s.l.].  1 poster pp.","Marine and anchialine caves are biodiversity reservoirs, harbouring disharmonic faunal communities with high endemism. The study of cave communities is important for understanding the evolutionary history of many taxa; however, our knowledge of cave diversity is highly biased in favor of large-bodied animals, particularly crustaceans. Meiofauna represents an important but often neglected component of cave biodiversity, due to lack of time and expertise for targeted collecting, as well as inadequate taxonomic capacity. Consequently, the significance of meiofauna in cave systems may have been overlooked and so seriously obscuring our understanding of macro-ecological and evolutionary patterns in cave environments. The World Register of marine Cave Species (WoRCS), a Thematic Species Database of WoRMS (www.marinespecies.org/worcs), is here presented as a valuable resource to overcome this problem. The aim of WoRCS is to create a comprehensive taxonomic and ecological database of cave species from worldwide marine and anchialine cave systems, including planktonic and benthic meiofaunal species. The cave-related information is managed by the WoRCS thematic editors in collaboration with the taxonomic editors of WoRMS, who manage the taxonomic content. The database is an open source and includes information on biological, ecological, and occurrence data for all species. Occurrence data are linked to the Gazetteer of the Marine and Anchialine Caves of the World, which is part of the Marine Regions information system and includes geographical and geological information for all studied cave localities. Currently, the database includes approximately 600 meiofaunal species belonging to 21 groups. Most recorded species are amongst hard-bodied meiofaunal groups, such as Podocopida (112 species), Harpacticoida (109 species) and Cyclopoida (96 species). In contrast, few data exist for other groups that are comparatively diverse outside caves, such as Nematoda (41 species) or Platyhelminthes (31 species). The potential taxonomic and geographical biases of our dataset are discussed, along with the different number of cave exclusive species recorded in each group. Our database confirms that further research about cave meiofauna is crucial to an accurate assessment.","Martínez, A.; Gerovasileiou, V.; Alvarez, F.; Boxshall, G.; Humphreys, W.F.; Jaume, D.; Iliffe, T.M.; Bailly, N.; Fontaneto, D.; Worsaae, K.",,"Gerovasileiou, Vasilis, V.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Ephemera,Poster,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along this process, we generated several data sets with QIIME, mothur and a custom-made pipeline based on DNAStar and the phylogenetic-tree based PhyloAssigner. For all processing strategies, default parameter settings and punctual variations were used. Our results revealed strong differences in total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicating that sequence preprocessing and clustering had a major impact on protist diversity estimates. However, diversity estimates of the abundant biosphere (abundance of ≥ 1%) were reproducible for all conducted processing pipeline versions. A qualitative comparison of diatom genera emphasized strong differences between the pipelines in which phylogenetic placement of sequences came closest to light microscopy-based diatom identification. We conclude that diversity studies using different sequence processing strategies are comparable if the focus is on higher taxonomic levels, and if abundance thresholds are used to filter out OTUs of the rare biosphere.","Hardge, K.; Neuhaus, S.; Kilias, E.S.; Wolf, C.; Metfies, K.; Frickenhaus, S.",WOS:000428335900004,"Hardge, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1755-0998.12726,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Dept Biosci, Bremerhaven, Germany.",Germany,amplicon metagenetics; biodiversity; diatoms; next-generation sequencing; protists,RARE BIOSPHERE; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PROTIST DIVERSITY; WRINKLES; SEARCH,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) - Department of Bioscience,x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Studies elsewhere have demonstrated marinas as important hubs for the stepping-stone transfer of non-indigenous species (NIS), but these unique anthropogenic, and typically artificial habitats have largely gone overlooked in the Mediterranean as sources of NIS hot-spots. From April 2015 to November 2016, 34 marinas were sampled across the following Mediterranean countries: Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to investigate the NIS presence and richness in the specialized hard substrate material of these marina habitats. All macroinvertebrate taxa were collected and identified. Additionally, fouling samples were collected from approximately 600 boat-hulls from 25 of these marinas to determine if boats host diverse NIS not present in the marina. Here, we present data revealing that Mediterranean marinas indeed act as major hubs for the transfer of marine NIS, and we also provide evidence that recreational boats act as effective vectors of spread. From this wide-ranging geographical study, we report here numerous new NIS records at the basin, subregional, country and locality level. At the basin level, we report three NIS new to the Mediterranean Sea (<i>Achelia sawayai sensu lato</i>, <i>Aorides longimerus</i>, <i>Cymodoce</i> aff. <i>fuscina</i>), and the re-appearance of two NIS previously known but currently considered extinct in the Mediterranean (<i>Bemlos leptocheirus, Saccostrea glomerata</i>). We also compellingly update the distributions of many NIS in the Mediterranean Sea showing some recent spreading; we provide details for 11 new subregional records for NIS (<i>Watersipora arcuata</i>, <i>Hydroides brachyacantha sensu lato</i> and <i>Saccostrea glomerata</i> now present in the Western Mediterranean; <i>Symplegma brakenhielmi</i>, <i>Stenothoe georgiana</i>, <i>Spirobranchus tertaceros sensu lato</i>, <i>Dendostrea folium sensu lato</i> and <i>Parasmittina egyptiaca</i> now present in the Central Mediterranean, and <i>W. arcuata</i>, <i>Bemlos leptocheirus</i> and <i>Dyspanopeus sayi</i> in the Eastern Mediterranean). We also report 51 new NIS country records from recreational marinas: 12 for Malta, 10 for Cyprus, nine for Greece, six for Spain and France, five for Turkey and three for Italy, representing 32 species. Finally, we report 20 new NIS records (representing 17 species) found on recreational boat-hulls (mobile habitats), not yet found in the same marina, or in most cases, even the country. For each new NIS record, their native origin and global and Mediterranean distributions are provided, along with details of the new record. Additionally, taxonomic characters used for identification and photos of the specimens are also provided.

Analysis of Reef Life Survey data for 4127 marine species at 2406 coral and rocky sites worldwide confirms that the total ecoregion richness peaks in low latitudes, near +15°N and −15°S. However, although richness at survey sites is maximal near the equator for vertebrates, it peaks at high latitudes for large mobile invertebrates. Site richness for different groups is dependent on abundance, which is in turn correlated with temperature for fishes and nutrients for macroinvertebrates. We suggest that temperature-mediated fish predation and herbivory have constrained mobile macroinvertebrate diversity at the site scale across the tropics. Conversely, at the ecoregion scale, richness responds positively to coral reef area, highlighting potentially huge global biodiversity losses with coral decline. Improved conservation outcomes require management frameworks, informed by hierarchical monitoring, that cover differing site- and regional-scale processes across diverse taxa, including attention to invertebrate species, which appear disproportionately threatened by warming seas.","Edgar, G.J.; Alexander, T.J.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Bates, A.E.; Kininmonth, S.J.; Thomson, R.J.; Duffy, J.E.; Costello, M.J.; Stuart-Smith, R.D.",WOS:000417998700006,"Kininmonth, Stuart, S.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1126/sciadv.1700419,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""EUROBIS ackn - indirect use"", ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Australia,,CORAL-REEFS; SEA-URCHIN; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; NICHE CONSERVATISM; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PROTECTED AREAS; MASS MORTALITY; RANGE SHIFTS; FISH; BIODIVERSITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Tasmania - Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS),x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

We investigated the combined effects of three cleaning variables: water (deionized and tap water), bleach (10% and 78%) and ultrasound (all for a range of durations), on the skeleton of <i>Flustra foliacea</i> (Linnaeus, 1758), a marine bryozoan. Treated and control carbonates were analysed both before and after cleaning, measuring: MgCO<sub>3</sub> in calcite (X-ray diffractometry and staining); organic:inorganic carbon ratio, using elemental analysis for total carbon by combustion and for organic carbon by acid dissolution and combustion. Treatment solutions were analysed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to detect any Ca<sup>2</sup> + and Mg<sup>2</sup> + that may have leached out. Significantly more weight loss and removal of MgCO3 from calcite occurred in bleach concentrations of 10% or higher, especially in longer duration treatments and with use of ultrasound. Specimens with higher initial MgCO<sub>3</sub> in calcite were especially susceptible to Mg leaching. We suggest that the interaction between bryozoan skeletal MgCO<sub>3</sub> and cleaning solutions is controlled by a combination of solution chemistry and reaction kinetics, and that when cleaning specimens prior to geochemical analysis, less is better.","Loxton, J.; Najorka, J.; Humphreys-Williams, E.; Kuklinski, P.; Smith, A.M.; Porter, J.S.; Spencer Jones, M.E.",WOS:000415613500005,"Spencer Jones, Mary, M.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.022,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Flustra foliacea,"Pretreatment, ""Ultrasound""",,Bryozoan,Journal article,,,"Univ Highlands & Isl, Environm Res Inst, Ormlie Rd, Thurso KW14 7EE, Scotland.",Scotland,Pretreatment; Bleach; Ultrasound; Bryozoan; Flustra foliacea,X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; CARBONATE MINERALOGY; MG-CALCITE; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PRETREATMENT; BRYOZOANS; CHEILOSTOMATA; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; GROWTH,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Geochemistry & Geophysics,University of Highlands and Islands - Environmental Research Institute,x,UK,,Research institute,Science

Because biological processes are difficult to directly record over large areas, abiotic characteristics are used as surrogate parameters. In this work, the Mediterranean Sea was classified into homogeneous spatial areas based on abiotic variables. Eight parameters were selected based on salinity, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, sea-wave heights and depth variables. The parameters were gathered in grid points of 0.5° spatial resolution in the open sea and 0.125° in coastal areas. The typologies were obtained by data mining the eight parameters throughout the Mediterranean and combining two clustering techniques: self-organizing maps and the k-means algorithm. The result is a division of the Mediterranean Sea into seven typologies. For these typologies, the classification recognizes differences in temperature, salinity and radiation. In addition, it separates coastal from deep areas. The influence of river discharges and the entrance of water from other seas are also reflected. These results are consistent with the ecological requirements of the five studied seagrasses (<i>Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina, Zostera noltei, Cymodocea nodosa, Halophila stipulacea</i>), supporting the suitability of the resulting classification and the proposed methodology. The approach thus provides a tool for the sustainable management of large marine areas and the ability to address not only present threats but also future conditions, such as climate change.","De La Hoz, C.F.; Ramos, E.; Puente, A.; Méndez, F.; Menendez, M.; Juanes, J.A.; Losada, I.J.",WOS:000415781600007,"De La Hoz, Camino, C.F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.09.058,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,Regions,,Meteo-oceanographic variables; Seagrasses; Environmental management; SOM; K-means,Journal article,,,"Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst, Avda Isabel Torres 15,Parque Cientif & Tecnol, Santander 39011, Spain.",Spain,Meteo-oceanographic variables; Seagrasses; Environmental management; Regions; SOM; K-means,COASTAL WATERS CLASSIFICATION; SEAGRASS POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; GROWTH DYNAMICS; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; CYMODOCEA-NODOSA; SALINITY; BIODIVERSITY; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; MACROALGAE,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Cantabria - Environmental Hydraulics Institute,x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

Unstable hydrodynamics and oxygen depletion are two crucial factors of decrease diversity in <i>T. stroemi – A. stepanovi </i>community. The species composition of <i>M. phaseolina</i>community at the border of the hydrogen sulfide area is distinct from those dwelling in oxic areas of the Black Sea. Living organisms of macrobenthos were not found at the oxygen content near 12 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> (160 m). This confirms that oxygen depletion at great depths is the limiting factor of life in the Black Sea. During MSM/15-cruise (2010) was found a large species of the polychaete <i>Sabella pavonina</i>(Savigny, 1822). This species was new record for the Black Sea.","Mazlumyan, S.; Boltachova, N.",,"Mazlumyan, Sofia, S.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,oxic/anoxic interface; macrobenthos distribution; biotopes at border of the hydrogen sulfide area; Black Sea,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These comprise wide trophic and salinity gradients, ranging from oligotrophic to hypertrophic status, and from nearly freshwater to slightly above marine Mediterranean Sea water salinities, respectively. The statistical analysis of a long-term dataset, including water column variables and observations of macrophyte genera, showed that salinity, depth, and then trophic status, were important factors explaining the distribution of benthic macrophytes for the soft-bottom sediments in the 34 studied French Mediterranean lagoons. Based on this, we assumed that the vegetation succession along the eutrophication gradient was different according to the lagoon salinity ranges. Euhaline and polyhaline lagoons follow the well-known Schramm schematic model, where aquatic angiosperm such as seagrasses dominate under oligotrophic conditions, and opportunistic macroalgae and phytoplankton dominate under eutrophic and hypertrophic conditions. In oligohaline and mesohaline lagoons, the succession is probably an intermediate scheme between the successions observed in small temperate lakes and in marine coastal ecosystems due to the presence of both brackish and freshwater species. We thus propose a conceptual scheme for the oligohaline and mesohaline lagoons.","Le Fur, I.; De Wit, R.; Oheix, J.; Ouisse, V.",WOS:000423827000014,"Le Fur, Ines, I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-017-3421-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Eutrophication, ""Salinity""",,French coastal lagoons; Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); Depth Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)  ,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, UMR MARBEC, IFREMER, IRD,CNRS,Stn Ifremer, Ave Jean Monnet,CS 30171, F-34203 Sete, France.",France,French coastal lagoons; Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); Eutrophication; Salinity; Depth; Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA),COASTAL LAGOONS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; THAU-LAGOON; POTAMOGETON-PECTINATUS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; AQUATIC VEGETATION; EUTROPHICATION; COMMUNITY; GRADIENT; SALINITY,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,"Joint Research Unit: Biodiversité Marine, Exploitation et Conservation (MARBEC) (UMR 9190)",x,France,,Research network,Science

DNA can persist extracellularly in the environment, making discrimination of living organisms difficult. In this study, bilge water samples (i.e., water accumulating on-board a vessel during transit) were collected from 15 small recreational and commercial vessels. eDNA and eRNA molecules were co-extracted and the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene targeted for metabarcoding. In total, 62.7% of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified at least once in the corresponding eDNA and eRNA reads, with 19.5% unique to eDNA and 17.7% to eRNA. There were substantial differences in diversity between molecular compartments; 57% of sequences from eDNA-only OTUs belonged to fungi, likely originating from legacy DNA. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of metazoan (50.2%) and ciliate (31.7%) sequences in the eRNA-only OTUs. Our data suggest that the presence of eRNA-only OTUs could be due to increased cellular activities of some rare taxa that were not identified in the eDNA datasets, unusually high numbers of rRNA transcripts in ciliates, and/or artefacts produced during the reverse transcriptase, PCR and sequencing steps. The proportions of eDNA/ eRNA shared and unshared OTUs were highly heterogeneous within individual bilge water samples. Multiple factors including boat type and the activities performed on-board, such as washing of scientific equipment, may play a major role in contributing to this variability. For some marine biosecurity applications analysis, eDNA-only data may be sufficient, however there are an increasing number of instances where distinguishing the living portion of a community is essential. For these circumstances, we suggest only including OTUs that are present in both eDNA and eRNA data. OTUs found only in the eRNA data need to be interpreted with caution until further research provides conclusive evidence for their origin.","Pochon, X.; Zaiko, A.; Fletcher, L.M.; Laroche, O.; Wood, S.A.",WOS:000414340200126,"Pochon, Xavier, X.","Cawthron Inst, Coastal & Freshwater Grp, Nelson, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0187636,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.",New Zealand,,BALLAST WATER; EXTRACELLULAR DNA; RISK-ASSESSMENT; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; RARE; VESSELS; IMPACTS; SPREAD,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Cawthron Institute,,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

Natural and human-made pressures, as well as climate change effects, are posing increasing threats on marine areas, triggering alteration of biological, chemical and physical processes. Planning of marine areas has become a challenge for decision makers involved in the design of sustainable management options. In order to address threats posed by climate drivers in combination with local to regional anthropogenic pressures affecting marine ecosystems and activities, a multi-hazard assessment methodology was developed and applied to the Adriatic Sea for the reference scenario 2000–2015. Through a four-stages process based on the consecutive analysis of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk the methodology allows a semi-quantitative evaluation of the relative risk from anthropogenic and natural sources to multiple endpoints, thus supporting the identification and ranking of areas and targets more likely to be at risk. Resulting output showed that the higher relative hazard scores are linked to exogenic pressures (e.g. sea surface temperature variation) while the lower ones resulted from endogenic and more localized stressors (e.g. abrasion, nutrient input). Relatively very high scores were observed for vulnerability over the whole case study for almost all the considered pressures, showing seagrasses meadows, maërl and coral beds as the most susceptible targets. The approach outlined in this study provides planners and decision makers a quick-screening tool to evaluate progress towards attaining a good environmental status and to identify marine areas where management actions and adaptation strategies would be best targeted. Moreover, by focusing on risks induced by land-based drivers, resulting output can support the design of infrastructures for reducing pressures on the sea, contributing to improve the land-sea interface management.","Furlan, E.; Torresan, S.; Critto, A.; Marcomini, A.",WOS:000424130500104,"Furlan, Elisa, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.076,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,Geographic information systems,,Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Multi-hazard assessment; Endogenic and exogenic pressures; Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis; Adriatic Sea;    ,Journal article,,,"Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30170 Venice, Italy.",Italy,Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Multi-hazard assessment; Endogenic and exogenic pressures; Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis; Adriatic Sea; Geographic information systems,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL RISK; HUMAN PRESSURES; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; IMPACT; STRESSORS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"University of Ca' Foscari - Department of Environmental Science, Informatics & Statistics",x,Italy,,University,Science

Biol. 220(21)</i>: 3916-3926","The changing climate is shifting the distributions of marine species, yet the potential for shifts in depth distributions is virtually unexplored. Hydrostatic pressure is proposed to contribute to a physiological bottleneck constraining depth range extension in shallow-water taxa. However, bathymetric limitation by hydrostatic pressure remains undemonstrated, and the mechanism limiting hyperbaric tolerance remains hypothetical. Here, we assess the effects of hydrostatic pressure in the lithodid crab <i>Lithodes maja</i> (bathymetric range 4–790 m depth, approximately equivalent to 0.1 to 7.9 MPa hydrostatic pressure). Heart rate decreased with increasing hydrostatic pressure, and was significantly lower at ≥10.0 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Oxygen consumption increased with increasing hydrostatic pressure to 12.5 MPa, before decreasing as hydrostatic pressure increased to 20.0 MPa; oxygen consumption was significantly higher at 7.5–17.5 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Increases in expression of genes associated with neurotransmission, metabolism and stress were observed between 7.5 and 12.5 MPa. We suggest that hyperbaric tolerance in <i>L. maja</i> may be oxygen-limited by hyperbaric effects on heart rate and metabolic rate, but that <i>L. maja</i> 's bathymetric range is limited by metabolic costs imposed by the effects of high hydrostatic pressure. These results advocate including hydrostatic pressure in a complex model of environmental tolerance, where energy limitation constrains biogeographic range, and facilitate the incorporation of hydrostatic pressure into the broader metabolic framework for ecology and evolution. Such an approach is crucial for accurately projecting biogeographic responses to changing climate, and for understanding the ecology and evolution of life at depth.","Brown, A.; Thatje, S.; Morris, J.P.; Oliphant, A.; Morgan, E.A.; Hauton, C.; Jones, D.O.B.; Pond, D.W.",WOS:000414145900017,"Brown, Alastair, A.","Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,"Heart rate, ""Hydrostatic pressure"", ""Respiration rate""",,Biogeographic range limitation; Metabolic theory; Hyperbaric physiology,Journal article,,,"Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",England,Biogeographic range limitation; Heart rate; Metabolic theory; Respiration rate; Hydrostatic pressure; Hyperbaric physiology,DEEP-SEA; THERMAL TOLERANCE; KINETIC BOTTLENECKS; EXCHANGE-RATES; HEART-RATE; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; WATER; INSIGHTS; STRESS,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,University of Southampton,,UK,,University,Science

We investigated the impact of migration barriers on downstream migrating European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>L.) by tracking 50 acoustically tagged eels between July 2012 and March 2015 in a Belgian polder area. The study area was selected due to the presence of a wide range of migration barriers, such as two pumping stations, a weir and tidal sluices. These structures regulate the water level, resulting in discontinuous flow conditions. The results showed that migration was primarily nocturnal and discharge appeared to be the main trigger for migration in the polder. We also observed substantial delays and exploratory behaviour near barriers. Delays can have a serious impact on eels since their energy resources are limited for a successful <i>trans</i>-Atlantic migration. In addition, delays and exploratory behaviour can also increase predation and disease risk.

Ocean temperature and nutrients typically covary over local and regional scales and play a crucial role on kelp dynamics. Examining their independent and interactive effects on kelp physiological performance is essential to understand and predict patterns of kelp distribution, particularly under scenarios of global change. 2. Crossed combinations of ocean temperatures and availability of nutrients were experimentally tested on juveniles of the ‘golden kelp’, <i>Laminaria ochroleuca</i>, from the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. Eco-physiological responses included: survival, growth and total N content. Results were embedded into a Species Distribution Model (SDM), which relates presence records and climatic and non-climatic data to forecast distribution patterns of <i>L. ochroleuca</i> under different climate change scenarios. 3. Temperatures above 24.6°C were lethal irrespective of nutrients. Optimal growth of juvenile sporophytes occurred between 12 and 18°C and no nutrient limitation. The SDM, where ocean temperature was the main predictor of kelp distribution in line with temperature thresholds given by eco-physiological responses, suggests a future expansion towards northern latitudes and a retreat from the southern limit/boundary of the current distribution. 4. Synthesis. Range-shifting of the golden kelp can have severe ecological impacts at regional and local scales. The expansion or retraction of the species along the European coast seems to be modulated mainly by temperature, but nutrient availability would be a key to maintain optimal physiological performance. Our work highlights that the combination of empirical and modelling approaches is accessible to researchers and crucial to building more robust predictions of ecological and biogeographic responses of habitat-forming species to forecasted environmental change.","Franco, J.N.; Tuya, F.; Bertocci, I.; Rodríguez, L.; Martínez, B.; Sousa Pinto, I.; Arenas, F.",WOS:000417839700004,"Martínez, Brezo, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1365-2745.12810,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",Portugal,Laminariales,"Climate change, ""Modelling"", ""Nutrients"", ""Temperature""",,brown seaweed; macrophytes; multiple perturbations; southern Europe ,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of limpets to accumulate metals and hydrocarbons has been examined in several field studies. In most cases there is a clear relationship between body content of a pollutant in soft tissues of limpets and the corresponding environmental level. Likewise, different responses to pollutants have been reported in limpets, including induction of DNA damage, induction of metallothioneins, oxidative stress, decrease of Neutral Red retention or variations in heart rate. Regarding the study of changes in community structure, an uneven response to disturbances (e.g. oil spills, wastewater discharge) by species of the genus <i>Patella</i> has been documented.

It has been found that the provinces were largely restricted to the palaeo-tropics and subtropics mainly of the Northern Hemisphere and they share a large proportion of their generic composition. The Northern Tropical Realm has been established to include these provinces. The distribution evinces presence of ocean surface currents in the tropics across longitudes. The possible currents moved through the relict Tethys Ocean, across the Atlantic Ocean and perhaps also across the Pacific. However, planktotrophic larvae of these benthic molluscs could not cross the deep ocean barrier that lay between the Northern Tropical Realm and the Austro-New Zealand Province of the Southern Hemisphere. The gastropod fauna in the latter province evolved independently. Distribution of all the provinces within palaeo-tropics and subtropics indicates strong control of temperature over it. Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum appears to be responsible for extinction and range contraction of high latitude faunas. Low latitude faunas also suffered significant extinction.

The methanol extract showed moderate DPPH free radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 27.88 μg/ml compared to the positive control ascorbic acid with an IC50 value of 7.27 μg/ml. Besides, the phenolic content of the methanol extract was found to be 68.21 mg/g of dried extract (GAE). Therefore, it is anticipated that the large amount of phenolic typed compounds contained in the methanol extract played a strong role in antioxidant action of this extract.

Unfortunately, these criteria are rarely met for marine organisms for which distributions are too often only scantly characterized and absences generally not recorded. Here, we investigate predictor relevance as a function of modelling algorithms and settings for a global dataset of marine species.Location: Global marine.Methods: We selected well-studied and identifiable species from all major marine taxonomic groups. Distribution records were compiled from public sources (e.g., OBIS, GBIF, Reef Life Survey) and linked to environmental data from Bio-ORACLE and MARSPEC. Using this dataset, predictor relevance was analysed under different variations of modelling algorithms, numbers of predictor variables, cross-validation strategies, sampling bias mitigation methods, evaluation methods and ranking methods. SDMs for all combinations of predictors from eight correlation groups were fitted and ranked, from which the top five predictors were selected as the most relevant. Results: We collected two million distribution records from 514 species across 18 phyla. Mean sea surface temperature and calcite are, respectively, the most relevant and irrelevant predictors. A less clear pattern was derived from the other predictors.

Sedimentary response to sea cucumber (<i>Holothuria scabra</i>) removal: Insights from experimental manipulations on a Fijian reef. MSc Thesis. University of Bremen, Faculty for Biology and Chemistry: Bremen.  71 pp.","Bioturbation through reef ecosystem engineers such as sea cucumbers can potentially enhance recycling of organic matter (OM) in reef sands. Benthic-pelagic coupling demonstrates that changes to the water column influence sediment properties as well as that sedimentary processes can affect the quality of overlying water. Coastal ecosystems are increasingly stressed by OM enrichment from human activities such as farming and sewage discharge. Thus the ability of sediment to degrade OM efficiently is vital to the buffering capacity of coastal ecosystems. However, growing demand from Asian markets is driving the overexploitation of sea cucumbers. Consequently, there is a need to understand the impact of their removal on reef ecosystems. This thesis aims to develop an understanding of how the removal of sea cucumbers affects sedimentary function in a biocatalytical recycling system. Holothuria scabra was historically found in high densities and exhibit a natural burrowing cycle thus playing a key role in bioturbation. Densities of H. scabra were manipulated in enclosures in situ on a reef flat at Natuvu Village on Vanua Levu, Fiji to simulate different fishing intensities. Two treatments (n=4 treatment-1) were used; high density (350 g m-2) and exclusion (0 g m-2), and two controls accounted for cage effects; cage control (no cage walls) and natural (60 g m-2). Sedimentary oxygen consumption (SOC), grain size distribution, porosity, and oxygen (O2) penetration depth were recorded. Sediment reworked through ingestion by H. scabra was quantified over the course of 2 weeks. After incorporating spatial surveys of H. scabra, our calculations show that the current population on Natuvu’s reef flat has the potential to rework ca. 7850 kg sediment dry wt year-1 1000 m-2. SOC rates were consistently higher in exclusion than high-density enclosures. O2 penetration depth decreased significantly when the stressors of both sea cucumber removal and elevated sea temperatures (likely caused by the 2016 El Niño) were combined. Thus removal of sea cucumbers may reduce the capacity of reef sediment to buffer negative effects of OM pulses, impeding the function and productivity of reef ecosystems. Consequently Pacific island communities are left more vulnerable as the ecosystem services that they rely heavily on for their livelihood may be compromised as a result of the extensive overfishing of sea cucumbers.","Lee, S.D.A.",,"Lee, Steven, S.D.A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevant anatomical novelties shown by the two new species testify that current knowledge about gastrotrich basic morphology is far from complete. This holds true also for taxa that are considered to be well-known (e.g. the speciose genus <i>Paraturbanella</i>), and stresses once again the importance of investigating new geographic areas in order to improve our understanding of global gastrotrich morphological diversity and species richness.","Todaro, M.A.; Dal Zotto, M.; Bownes, S.J.; Perissinotto, R.",WOS:000415365400005,"Todaro, M.

However, there are quite a few coasts that have rarely been studied for their macro-benthic diversity. The Indian coastline presents one such gap area. Two sub-parallel coastlines of India have a wide latitudinal span (8–23°N) and strikingly different physiographic environments. While the east coast receives a high siliciclastic input from large river systems flowing to the Bay of Bengal with fluctuating salinity, the west coast has a large shelf area and high productivity of the Arabian Sea. Such difference enables us to evaluate the effect of regional environmental parameters on marine molluscan diversity and distribution in an intra-tropical setting. Because of the wide latitudinal range, it is also possible to assess if spatial difference in species richness in such a regional scale follows the large-scale biodiversity pattern such as Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient (LBG) despite inherent environmental variation. We used species distribution of marine bivalves, compiled using bioSearch and the Ocean Productivity database, to address this question. Our results show that intra-tropical species richness of marine bivalves is guided primarily by regional environmental parameters. Even with identical latitudinal extent, higher nutrient availability and larger shelf area, the west coast has significantly lower richness than the east coast; among environmental variables, productivity, salinity and coastline length emerged as significant predictors of species diversity. Moreover, a positive influence of a South Asian biodiversity hotspot on east coast fauna and a negative impact of the oxygen-depleted condition of Arabian Sea on west coast fauna, may have a significant contribution in developing such coastal variation in species richness. The latitudinal variation in species richness did not follow LBG. In contrast to the coast-specific diversity difference, species composition is not found to be dictated by coastal affiliation. The composition corresponds primarily to physiographic conditions. We identified three distinct eco-regions (north-western, southern, north-eastern) with characteristic species composition corresponding to unique physiography and productivity mechanism. The NW region has low siliciclastic input and high productivity associated with upwelling during winter cooling. The NE region has a distinctly high riverine input and salinity fluctuation. The southern region, in contrast, has well developed reefal system with moderate variation in salinity. Such correspondence underscores the importance of the regional environment in dictating the species diversity and distribution in the shallow marine realm.","Sarkar, D.; Bhattacherjee, M.; Chattopadhyay, D.",WOS:000458495600016,"Sarkar, Deepjay, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315417001837,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biodiversity, ""Latitudinal variations"", ""Species composition""",,Bay of Bengal; Arabian Sea,Journal article,,,"Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur 741246, WB, India.",India,Biodiversity; latitudinal variation; species composition; Bay of Bengal; Arabian Sea,OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE; MACROBENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SIZE-FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION; ARABIAN SEA; DIVERSITY GRADIENTS; TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL PATTERNS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata (IISER Kolkata),x,India,,Research institute,Science

The fields of conservation biology and ecology confront the challenge of inflated biodiversity, attributed to non-recognition of taxonomic inconsistencies such as synonyms, alternate representation, emendations etc. Critical review of the checklists and distributional records of Phylum Echinodermata from Indian waters and subsequent validation of species names with World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database, revealed that the current literature included 236 incorrect entries comprising of 162 synonyms, 15 emendations, 5 <i>nomina dubia</i> , 1 <i>nomen nudum</i> , 40 species under alternate representation, 9 species with author misnomer, 1 subspecies and 1 unaccepted. The 226 species found to be mixed with valid names and a revised checklist was prepared. The revised and updated checklist holds 741 species of echinoderms comprising of 182 asteroids (24.56%), 70 crinoids (9.45%), 138 echinoids (18.62%), 179 holothuroids (24.16%) and 172 ophiuroids (23.21%), placed under 28 orders and 107 families.

The basis of the discipline lies in the zooarchaeologist’s ability to identify faunal remains based on analogy with known specimens, either from a comparative faunal collection or from experience. Yet, today many zooarchaeologists work in regions of the world without adequate comparative materials or in diverse settings with different research demands, such as contract archaeology or forensic laboratories. At the same time, advances in genetic research are restructuring the phylogenetic classification schemes of many taxa, calling into question the foundation of zooarchaeological analogy. In this chapter we argue that zooarchaeologists, who have never had specific disciplinary-wide “research standards”, should seek epistemological flexibility regarding specimen identification, evaluation, and correction to continue the scientific advancement of the discipline. We review past zooarchaeologists’ concerns regarding the nature of specimen identification and data sharing, discuss the dynamic nature of species reclassification in phylogenetics and its effect on zooarchaeology, and provide case studies of challenges zooarchaeologists face while trying to make identifications in diverse settings and with less-than-adequate resources. Finally, we discuss the importance of maintaining epistemological flexibility in the age of “big data”, where shared datasets of identifications cannot and should not be seen as immutable entities, but rather observations that are subject to reanalysis, change, and improvement as zooarchaeologists keep abreast of ongoing discoveries in their own field as well as those of related disciplines.","LeFebvre, M.J.; Sharpe, A.E.",,"LeFebvre, Michelle, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-64763-0_3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Identification, ""Taxonomy""",,Zooarchaeological epistemology; Analogy; Bid data; Best practices ,Book/Monograph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence and intensification of Portugal Current probably induced heat transfer to this distal region of the Iberian Margin. Our results also suggest the occurrence of high variability in the intensity and wind patterns during the last glaciation. In some periods, the intensity of northerly winds could have been very strong and contributed to a significant stimulation of ocean productivity in this distal area through the intensification of upwelling. In general, oceanic productivity decreased during the HS and D–O as the presence of cold and less saline water prevented nutrient rich waters from deep levels reaching the surface.

Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates polyphyly of Podocotyloides; prompts us to resurrect Pedunculacetabulum Yamaguti, 1934; and suggests that Pod. brevis Andres & Overstreet, 2013, from a deep-sea congrid in the Caribbean, and Pod. parupenei (Manter, 1963) Pritchard, 1966 and Pod. stenometra Pritchard, 1966, from mullids and chaetodontids, respectively, on the Great Barrier Reef, may each represent a distinct genus awaiting recognition. Our revised concept of Podocotyloides requires a pedunculate ventral sucker, but also a uterine sphincter prior to the genital atrium, a petalloid cirrus appendage, restriction of the vitelline follicles to the hindbody, and for the excretory vesicle to reach to the level of the ventral sucker.

The challenge of <i>Cystoseira crinita</i>: combined effect of temperature and radiation. BSc Thesis. Universitat de Girona, Facultat de Ciències: Girona.  30 pp.","The Mediterranean Sea is a hotspot of marine species biodiversity where most of the submerged forests are dominated by fucoid species of the genus Cystoseira. Benthic assemblages subjected to a low or moderate hydrodynamics between zero and one meter deep and restricted to rocky subtracts are occasionally dominated by Cystoseira crinita, that because of the shallow habitat is particularly vulnerable and finds refuge in rock pools and in very shallow waters of sheltered coves. The most important consequences of climate change on aquatic ecosystems are probably the temperature and UV radiation increases. These rocks pools, due to the low deep and hydrodynamics may experience high temperatures and radiations that, especially considering the present climate warming framework, may impair these populations which are actually vulnerable. The main objective of this study is to determine if positive thermic anomalies may be a driver of C. crinita decline, at least in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. For this, our specific aims are: determine if the temperature and ultraviolet radiation increases affects physiological state of adults individuals and elucidate if temperature and radiation have a synergistic, cumulative or antagonistic effect on this physiological state. The experiment consisted on the application of six treatments combining two different environmental parameters, radiation (PAR and PAR + UV) and temperature (21, 24 and 28 ºC) during 30 days. At 21 and 24 ºC, in both radiations, total height and maximum quantum yields of photosynthesis, Fv/Fm, remained constant during experiment, but humid weight began to decrease after 30 days and the Fv/Fm after 12. At 28 ºC effects were differentially caused by radiation exposure, so that under PAR began to lose humid weight after day 12 and reduced its total height, but under PAR + UV began to lose humid weight after day 18. In addition, at 21 ºC under PAR + UV radiation individuals increased its apex height. These results suggest that C. crinita has efficient protective mechanisms against UV radiation and its thermic tolerance is adapted to resist a long time under the current normal summer temperatures. However, our results also show that although C. crinita is able to resist short and punctual periods at high temperatures, it is not able to resist mid-long periods at temperatures up to 28ºC (thermal anomalies). Also, the interaction between temperature and radiation has an antagonistic effect .","González Sampedro, Y.",,"González Sampedro, Yolanda, Y.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,BSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few species (<50) of parasites have been found in lionfish. Not only is parasitic prevalence low in lionfish, but they also seem to exhibit resistance to the effects of fatty liver disease. This research provides an updated parasite survey and reports six species of parasites, three of which are parasite species reported for the first time in lionfish; (1) one Cymothoid isopod: Olencira praegustator, (2) one Corallanidae isopod: Excorallana truncata, and (3) an acanthocephalan: Serrasentis sagittifer. Overall parasite prevalence and intensity was low for all hosts, and were significantly higher in males. A baseline study of fatty liver analysis in lionfish revealed that >85% of examined fish displayed evidence of fatty liver disease, and most exhibited moderate degrees of disease. Sex, location, and standard length of lionfish did not play a significant role in degree of disease, though slight disease differences were observed among locations. Outward condition (i.e. skin/scale integrity, coloration, observed mass) of specimens observed in relation to fatty liver disease and parasitism seemed relatively unaffected.","Fails, D.M.",,"Fails, Danielle, D.M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Histology, ""Parasites"", ""Predators"", ""Resistance""",,Lionfish; Fatty liver disease; Invasive species; Gulf of Mexico; Caribbean,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

From May to September 2016, pile driving was taking place at the Nobelwind wind farm located on the Bligh Bank in Belgium. In this period, porpoise activity was recorded using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) using Continuous Porpoise Detectors (C-PoDs), at various distances from the construction site (1 – > 55 km). In this study, we compared porpoise detections before, during and after pile driving. During piling, porpoise detections decreased at stations located up to 20 km from the location of the piling event. At larger distances (20-55 km), porpoise detections either remained the same or increased slightly during piling events, which may be due to displaced porpoises entering the area. Underwater sound levels were extrapolated for the different locations. Pile driving sound levels at the furthest distance where reductions in porpoise detections were observed were ~159 dB re 1μPa (Lsub>z-p</sub>), which is close to the threshold level for major disturbance for harbour porpoise proposed in literature.","Rumes, B.; Debusschere, E.; Reubens, J.; Norro, A.; Haelters, J.; Deneudt, K.; Degraer, S.",,"Deneudt, Klaas, K.",Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Here, we target ethnic food stores in two British cities (Liverpool and Manchester metropolitan areas), whose numbers are increasing throughout Europe, to examine accuracy of traceability information available to consumers. Despite the existence of thorough EU labelling regulations, we unveil a high level of non-compliance, with a diverse range of poorly-known fish species, often sold without any label or with erroneous information, as demonstrated by DNA barcoding. Results indicate that about 41% of the samples were mislabelled, in stark contrast with a recent study that, in 2015, found < 5% mislabelling in EU supermarkets and fishmongers. These results highlight that inspectors and governments might not be fully aware of the wide diversity of fish species traded, indicating the need for a stronger enforcement of the EU labelling legislations.

Despite the value of communities as distinct entities, e.g. for conservation purposes, there is still an ongoing debate on the nature of species associations. They are seen either as communities, cohesive units of non-randomly associated and interacting members, or as assemblages, groups of species that are randomly associated. We investigated such dualism using fuzzy logic applied to a large dataset in the German Bight (southeastern North Sea). Fuzzy logic provides the flexibility needed to describe complex patterns of natural systems. Assigning objects to more than one class, it enables the depiction of transitions, avoiding the rigid division into communities or assemblages. Therefore we identified areas with either structured or random species associations and mapped boundaries between communities or assemblages in this more natural way. We then described the impact of the chosen sampling design on the community identification. Four communities, their core areas and probability of occurrence were identified in the German Bight: AMPHIURA-FILIFORMIS, BATHYPOREIA-TELLINA, GONIADELLA-SPISULA, and PHORONIS. They were assessed by estimating overlap and compactness and supported by analysis of beta-diversity. Overall, 62% of the study area was characterized by high species turnover and instability. These areas are very relevant for conservation issues, but become undetectable when studies choose sampling designs with little information or at small spatial scales.","Fiorentino, D.; Pesch, R.; Guenther, P.; Gutow, L.; Holstein, J.; Dannheim, J.; Ebbe, B.; Bildstein, T.; Schroeder, W.; Schuchardt, B.; Brey, T.; Wiltshire, K.H.",WOS:000418268900002,"Pesch, Roland, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12354,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Ecological communities · Benthic macrofauna · Fuzzy classification · Spatial scales,Journal article,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, D-23129 Oldenburg, Germany.",Germany,Ecological communities; Benthic macrofauna; Fuzzy classification; Spatial scales,"DIAMOND,J.M.

While shown to be useful in areas where they have been developed, some indices may not be readily transferrable to other regions due to differences in species ecology or composition, stressor type or magnitude, and natural variability. Using a national New Zealand dataset compiled from estuary monitoring data for 2001–2016, we used linear mixed models to determine the effect of multiple stressors (sediment mud content, metals and total phosphorus) and natural variability (associated with space, estuary type and time) on nine indices developed in New Zealand and overseas. The Richness-Integrated AZTI Marine Biotic Index (RI-AMBI), a modification of a popular overseas biotic index, had the most variation explained by stressors overall (marginal pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22 compared to ≤0.15 for all other indices). This variation was primarily explained by a single stressor, sediment mud content, which is the dominant stressor in New Zealand estuaries. However, although the overall variation explained by stressors was lower for all other indices, multiple, rather than single, stressors had significant effects on some indices. For example all three stressors had a significant effect on the Traits Based Index, and the variation explained by metals was highest for this index. Relatively high amounts of natural and unexplained variation for all indices suggested that further understanding is required before operational implementation of indices at a national scale. Thus, the use of more than one index, i.e. a weight of evidence approach, is suggested to minimise uncertainty related to inaccuracy and misclassification of ecological health in New Zealand estuaries.","Berthelsen, A.; Atalah, J.; Clark, D.; Goodwin, E.; Patterson, M.; Sinner, J.",WOS:000430634500066,"Berthelsen, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.060,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biotic index; Macrofauna; Estuary; Ecological health; Estuary type; Natural variation,Journal article,,,"Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Biotic index; Macrofauna; Estuary; Ecological health; Estuary type; Natural variation,ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY-HEALTH; BENTHIC INDEX; MACROFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES; CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; COASTAL; FRAMEWORK; EUTROPHICATION; DISTRIBUTIONS,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Cawthron Institute,x,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

The persistence of populations depends on temperature-mediated outcomes of ecological and demographic processes across all stages of a species’ life history, as well as any adaptation to local temperature regimes. We assessed the relationships between sea temperature and observed distributional ranges for 1,790 shallow-water marine species from 10 animal classes and found remarkable consistencies in trends in realized thermal limits among taxa and ocean basins, as well as general agreement with previous laboratory findings. Realized thermal niches increase from the Equator towards cold–temperate locations, despite an opposite trend in geographic range size. Species’ cool distribution limits are best predicted by the magnitude of seasonality within their range, while a relatively firm thermal barrier exists on the equatorward range edge for temperate species. Our findings of consistencies in realized thermal limits indicate potential limits to adaptation among common marine species and highlight the value of realized thermal niches for predicting species’ distributional dynamics in warming seas.","Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Edgar, G.J.; Bates, A.E.",WOS:000417194600012,"Edgar, Graham, G.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41559-017-0353-x,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, global taxonomic progress, combined with many new species records for Greece, required a thorough review of the taxonomic, nomenclatural and biogeographic status of the national species list. This checklist revises the status of all extant polychaete species reported from the Greek Exclusive Economic Zone since 1832. The work was undertaken as part of the efforts on compiling a national species inventory (Greek Taxon Information System initiative) in the framework of the LifeWatchGreece Research Infrastructure.New informationThis checklist comprises an updated and annotated inventory of polychaete species in Greek waters, compiled from literature reports, online databases, museum collections and unpublished datasets. The list provides information on 836 species-level taxa from Greece, of which 142 are considered questionable. An additional 84 species reported in the past are currently considered absent from Greece; reasons for the exclusion of each species are given. Fourteen species are reported here for the first time from Greek waters. At least 52 species in the present list constitute in fact a complex of cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species. Forty-seven species are considered non-native to the area. In addition to the species-level taxa reported in this checklist, eleven genera have been recorded from Greece with no representatives identified to species level. One replacement name is introduced. For each species, a comprehensive bibliographic list of occurrence records in Greece and the synonyms used in these publications are provided as supplementary material. Where necessary, the taxonomic, nomenclatural or biogeographic status is discussed. Finally, the findings are discussed in the wider context of Mediterranean polychaete biogeography, taxonomic practice and worldwide research progress.","Faulwetter, S.; Simboura, N.; Katsiaras, N.; Chatzigeorgiou, G.; Arvanitidis, C.",WOS:000449735600001,"Arvanitidis, Christos, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.5.e20997,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Annelida, ""Polychaeta""",,,"Eastern Mediterranean, Polychaeta, Annelida, inventory, biodiversity, new records, replacement name",Data paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The available marine biodiversity data in Iran are sparse and abandoned on libraries’ shelves and, as such, accessing relevant and reliable current information about the status of Iranian southern seas biodiversity is challenging. Therefore, there is an urgent need to extract, standardize, and evaluate these biodiversity data. A comprehensive review of the available biodiversity data on the Iranian southern seas provided an estimate about the species diversity and highlighted the amount of reliable biodiversity data, research gaps, and required information for the lesser-known areas. In the present review, the available biodiversity data records of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman under Iranian ownership was extracted from non-database information sources (books, theses, research reports, and articles) and open-access database portals, such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.jm7hat), and those museum collections with online portal data collection search facilities. In total, 59,745 biodiversity records were extracted from all information sources. After data standardization based on the OBIS data scheme (Darwin core format), eight criteria with 29 sub-criteria were considered and scored to measure the validity of each record. Consequently, the presence of 3364 valid species (more than twice the number predicted earlier for the total species diversity) was reported for the study area. Describing new species shows an increasing trend, as most of the 80 new species until the beginning of 2018 were described recently. Mollusca phylum had the most amount of synonymy in non-database information sources. The results show that some marine taxa have been ignored in previous studies and the focus was on a certain group of organisms. Multi-criteria scoring analysis shows that 6% of the extracted biodiversity data for non-database information sources have 75–100% credit (valid), 70% have 50–75% credit (semi-valid), 23.4% have 25–50% credit (a little valid), and 0.9% have 0–25% credit (invalid). On the other hand, OBIS data extracted for Iran do not have invalid data due to its good data quality control, but 58 and 20% of its extracted data are semi-valid and valid, respectively. We believe that all of the eight mentioned criteria are required for reporting biodiversity data, and our proposed weighting system helps different users who need to know how reliable is the published data.","Maghsoudlou, A.; Momtazi, F.; Nasiri, K.; Pazooki, S.; Molavi-Arabshahi, M.; Sepahvand, V.; Hekmatara, M.; Khaledi, H.",WOS:000463684600001,"Maghsoudlou, Abdolvahab, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-017-0835-8,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Species richness; Persian Gulf; Gulf of Oman; Darwin core data format; Quality control ,Journal article,,,"INIOAS, Tehran, Iran.",Iran,Species richness; Persian Gulf; Gulf of Oman; Darwin core data format; Quality control,PERSIAN-GULF; CESTODA TETRAPHYLLIDEA; CIRRIPEDIA THORACICA; CRUSTACEA-AMPHIPODA; COASTAL MANAGEMENT; SP NOV.; SP N.; OMAN; DECAPODA; GENUS,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,INIOAS (Iranian National Institute for Oceanography and Atmospheric Science),,Iran,,Research institute,Science

We have concentrated on the tropical regions of Australia and the Coral Triangle. The best known groups are the corals, fish, and commercially important invertebrates. In considering whether this is true, we have concentrated on the diversity of benthic communities and water column communities which are poorly known. Yet at the bottom of the food chain these communities are highly dynamic and susceptible to the anthropogenic changes that are occurring with the rapid development in this highly populated region. Tropical biodiversity is under increasing stress from a synergistic combination of changes in climate, oceanographic regimes, increasing coastal development, overfishing, and poor water quality, resulting in bleaching of corals and loss of habitat and of associated fauna. These changes on reefs have received substantial research attention; in comparison, there is limited data on inter-reefal areas and water column communities and limited understanding of the ecological interconnectivity of all these habitats. While in this region there is growing marine protected area coverage, the major focus is on coral reefs with other habitats based on surrogacy with little if any ground-truthing. Within this region, there is limited capacity or inclination to rectify this lack of knowledge of the structure and ecology of the broader non-commercial benthic and pelagic communities. We suggest this lack of knowledge and limited expertise may be widespread throughout the tropics and compromises our ability to understand and predict the changes that are occurring with increasing anthropogenic impacts on these tropical ecosystems.","Kenchington, R.; Hutchings, P.",WOS:000428553300001,"Hutchings, Pat, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d10010001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,biodiversity; benthic invertebrate infauna; epifauna; surrogacy,Journal article,,,"Australian Museum, Australian Museum Res Inst, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia.",Australia,,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CORAL-REEFS; IMPACTS; FISH; CONSERVATION; MAGNITUDE; MANGROVE; PATTERNS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Australian Museum,x,Australia,,Museum,Science

A classification on the origin of the species indicates that the majority (62%) are cryptogenic while 27% (n = 18) are considered native. Given the natural limitations for genetic exchange between the archipelago’s bryozoan populations and those from neighboring shores, the taxa presently considered as cryptogenic may yield a considerable amount of endemic species after taxonomic revision. The remaining 11% are confirmed as non-indigenous species, highlighting the importance of human-mediated transport in considerably enhancing the diversity of bryozoans in remote oceanic archipelagos, which would otherwise be off-limits to their natural dispersal capacity. In view of the need to quantitatively evaluate the certainty of species-level identification when assembling such biodiversity inventories, we have developed a method to attribute a degree of certainty to species records.

Samples were collected at fifteen localities covering Mediterranean Sea and NE Atlantic coast, and representative of three types of coastal ecosystems: mesotidal bays, coastal lagoons, and open-sea. Three geographically distinct flavonoid chemotypes were identified on the basis of their respective major compound.

A recent diversity study from the abyssal plain in the Northwest Pacific has revealed a wealth of new abyssal solenogaster lineages highlighting the need for further alpha-taxonomic work. During the ‘Sea of Okhotsk Biodiversity Studies’ (SokhoBio) expedition, 93 specimens were collected at overall eight stations ranging from depths of 1696 m to 3377 m. Preliminary investigations revealed twelve clearly distinguishable morphospecies, including one relatively common species present at six of eleven stations. All morphospecies are characterized externally via light microscopy and identified to the best possible taxonomic level via scleritome characters. Molecular barcodes (16 S rRNA) are provided as a first step towards establishment of a barcoding library to enable fast and accurate re-identification of these taxonomically challenging molluscs in future studies. The most wide-spread and abundant cavibelonian Solenogastres <i>Kruppomenia genslerae</i> sp. nov.

Less well known is the use of muricid opercula in sacred incense and traditional medicines, although they are still used as rare ingredients today. This study provides the first chemical assessment of opercula from Muricidae, based on several traditional preparation procedures. Chemical analysis of opercula smoke revealed aromatic phenols, which act as fragrance stabilisers and produce a “medicinal” odour. Analysis of lipid extracts revealed pharmaceutically active compounds, including brominated indoles, choline esters and adenosine, consistent with their traditional medical applications. Depending on the preparation procedures, toxic pyridine was also detected. ICP-MS analysis of muricid opercula shows the presence of essential macro and microelements, as well as metals, some of which exceed the recommended safe levels for human use. Nevertheless, these findings support the Muricidae as an historically important marine resource, providing Biblical dyes, medicines and perfume. The opercula contains biologically active compounds and produces smoke containing volatile scent compounds, consistent with their identification as the most likely source of onycha, a controversial ingredient in sacred incense.","Nongmaithem, B.; Mouatt, P.; Smith, J.; Rudd, D.; Russell, M.; Sullivan, C.; Benkendorff, K.",WOS:000417689400028,"Benkendorff, Kirsten, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-017-17551-3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.",Australia,,TYRIAN PURPLE; MARINE MOLLUSK; METABOLITES; DIVERSITY; ADENOSINE; PHENOLS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Southern Cross University - School of Environment, Science and Engineering - Marine Ecology Research Centre (MERC)",x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

The material was collected during the expedition SokhoBio (Sea of Okhotsk Biodiversity Studies) in the summer of 2015. The first data on the composition and distribution of the family Munnopsidae from the SokhoBio samples are presented. In total 2,190 individuals of Munnopsidae from 53 species, 26 genera and seven subfamilies have been collected at 19 of 21 C-EBS stations at all 11 sites of the SokhoBio expedition. The most abundant subfamily in the samples was Ilyarachninae Hansen, 1916 (36%), followed by Eurycopinae Hansen, 1916 (29%). In the Kuril Basin 39 species of 20 genera and 5 subfamilies were found, the main portion of munnopsids here was represented by the Ilyarachninae (39%), followed by the group of genera <i>incertae sedis</i> (31%) and Eurycopinae (27%). The abyssal munnopsid fauna of the Kuril Basin is an intermediate in terms of diversity and species richness between the adjacent studied abyssal areas, the Sea of Japan and the open abyssal of the KKT. Half of the collected species, 27 species (51%) are shared with the KKT area, 22 species (41.5%) are common to the Kuril Basin and the Pacific sites. About 80% of the collected species are new to science. One of the new species, <i>Gurjanopsis kurilensis</i> sp. nov. is described herein. <i>Gurjanopsis</i> Malyutina and Brandt, 2007 is the only genus within the Munnopsidae having a posteromedial notch in the pleotelson containing tiny uropods and the anus. A similar notch in the pleotelson containing uropods within Janiroideа Kussakin, 1967 is known only in species of <i>Jaera</i> Leach, 1814 (Janiridae G.O. Sars, 1897). The male pleopods of <i>Gurjanopsis</i> which cover the pleopodal cavity of the pleotelson are unusual for the family. This “operculum” is formed by the small pleopods 1 and 2 and the enlarged exopods of pleopods 3. This is similar to the pleopodal structure found in the primitive asellote superfamilies Aselloidea Latreille, 1802 and Stenotrioidea Hansen 1905, while in Janiroideа only pleopods 1 and 2 are operculate. The new species is the third species of the rare genus <i>Gurjanopsis</i> and the first record of the genus, previously only known from the deep-sea of the Arctic and the Antarctic, for the Pacific Ocean. The finding a species of <i>Baeonectes</i> Wilson, 1982 in abyssal depths of the Kuril Basin is the deepest record of the genus.","Malyutina, M.V.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000452580500021,"Malyutina, Marina, M.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.12.006,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Asellota, ""Gurjanopsis"", ""Munnopsidae""",,,Asellota; Munnopsidae; Gurjanopsis; taxonomy; new species; Northwest Pacific; deep sea; Sea of Okhotsk; Kuril Basin; benthos; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area; SokhoBio; diversity; distribution,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Far Eastern Branch, Natl Sci Ctr Marine Biol, 17 Palchevskogo St, Vladivostok 690041, Russia.",Russia,Asellota; Munnopsidae; Gurjanopsis; Taxonomy; New species; Northwest Pacific; Deep sea; Sea of Okhotsk; Kuril Basin; Benthos; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area; SokhoBio; Diversity; Distribution,PERACARID CRUSTACEANS MALACOSTRACA; EURYCOPE-SPINIFRONS GURJANOVA; KAMCHATKA TRENCH; SPECIES COMPOSITION; ABYSSAL DEPTHS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; REDESCRIPTION; EXPEDITIONS; BAEONECTES,Oceanography,Oceanography,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - Far East Branch - A.V.

Crucial insight in animal behaviour and ecosystem functioning and dynamics is gained through acoustic receiver networks that are established in many different environments around the globe. The main limitation to this technique is the ability of the receivers to detect the signals from tagged animals present in the nearby area. To interpret acoustic data correctly, understanding influencing factors on the detection probability is critical. Therefore, range test studies are an essential part of acoustic telemetry research. Here, we investigated whether specific environmental factors (i.e. wind, currents, waves, background noise, receiver tilt and azimuth) influence the receiver detection probability for a permanent acoustic receiver network in Belgium. Noise and wind speed in relation to distance, the interaction of receiver tilt and azimuth and current speed were the most influential variables affecting the detection probability in this environment. The study indicated that there is high detection probability up to a distance of circa 200 m. A new setup, making use of features that render valuable information for data analysis and interpretation, was tested and revealed general applicability.","Reubens, J.; Verhelst, P.; van der Knaap, I; Deneudt, K.; Moens, T.; Hernandez, F.",WOS:000509102300005,"Deneudt, Klaas, K.",Flanders Marine Institute,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-017-3478-7,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,"Range test, Acoustic telemetry, Detection probability, LifeWatch project, North Sea ",Journal article,,,"Flanders Marine Inst, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Belgium,Range test; Acoustic telemetry; Detection probability; LifeWatch project; North Sea,DESIGN; ARRAY; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; RECEIVERS; MOVEMENTS; TRACKING; ANIMALS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

However, understanding of multiple facets of diversity and their determinants in the freshwater realm remains limited. Here, we characterized the geographical gradients, hotspots and spatial congruence of three facets of freshwater molluscan diversity and evaluated the relative importance of three different underlying mechanisms related to the energy, area/environmental heterogeneity and dispersal/historical hypotheses.  Location:  China.  Methods:  Species richness (SR), functional richness (FR) and taxonomic distinctness (TD, a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) were calculated for 212 drainage basins with a total of 313 molluscan species. Spatial congruence between the diversity facets was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficient and overlap among hotspots. Multiple linear regression models and variation partitioning were used to assess the relative importance of different mechanisms.  Results:  Hotspots of SR and FR were mainly concentrated in the Yangtze River and Huai River basins, while high TD values were patchily distributed across China. We found extremely low spatial congruence between TD and both SR and FR, while there was relatively high concordance between SR and FR. All diversity facets were best explained by the dispersal/historical hypothesis with strong unique effects, followed by the factors related to the energy hypothesis. The area/ environmental heterogeneity hypothesis was only weakly supported. Main conclusions:  We found a potentially strong influence of dispersal limitation and evolutionary history on the geographical diversity gradients of Chinese molluscs. This finding contrasts with the general finding that energy-related factors are the strongest correlates of diversity patterns at large spatial scales. Moreover, our results do not support the idea that using any one diversity component as a surrogate of the others in developing conservation strategies. Instead, an integrative approach embracing multiple facets of diversity should be adopted in the conservation of freshwater biodiversity.","Cai, Y.; Zhang, M.; Xu, J.; Heino, J.",WOS:000427246300006,"Zhang, Min, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12695,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,biodiversity hotspots; functional diversity; phylogenetic diversity; spatial congruence; species richness; taxonomic distinctness ,Journal article,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol China, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,biodiversity hotspots; functional diversity; phylogenetic diversity; spatial congruence; species richness; taxonomic distinctness,GLOBAL DIVERSITY PATTERNS; SPECIES-RICHNESS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; FISH COMMUNITIES; BIOGEOGRAPHY; CLIMATE; SCALE,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Chinese Academy of Sciences - Minististry of Agriculture - Key Lab Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology,,,,,

The genus <i<Vesicomya</i> is morphologically very similar to the genus <i>Kelliella</i>, the type genus of family Kelliellidae. This fact has long caused taxonomic ambiguities and it has been suggested that <i>Vesicomya</i> and <i>Kelliella</i>, as well as their respective nominate families, should be synonymized. In this paper we study the relationship between <i>Vesicomya</i> and <i>Kelliella</i>, for the first time using not only morphological characters but also genetic divergence based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Our molecular data indicate that the genera <i>Vesicomya</i> and <i>Kelliella</i> are clearly distinct and that Kelliella is distantly related to the Vesicomyidae. Results of morphological analysis support the molecular inferences. We provide further evidence for the relationship of vesicomyines and pliocardiines and propose an evolutionary scenario according to which Vesicomyinae is the less derived group and Pliocardiinae the more derived. We provide the first information on stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of soft tissues of Vesicomya and Kelliella. These data do not suggest involvement of chemosynthetically fixed carbon in the nutrition of either <i>Vesicomya</i> or <i>Kelliella</i>. We revise current usage of these two genera and provide lists of the species of each, with details of their distribution. A new species, <i>Vesicomya alleni</i>, is described on the basis of morphological and molecular characters.","Krylova, E.M.; Sahling, H.; Borowski, C.",WOS:000424141600009,"Borowski, Christian, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyx050,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Kelliella, ""Vesicomya"", ""Vesicomya alleni""",,,Vesicomya alleni,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nahimovskiy Prospekt, Moscow 117997, Russia.",Russia,,KURIL-KAMCHATKA TRENCH; COLD-SEEP COMMUNITIES; 1ST RECORD; SEA; GENUS; MOLLUSCA; PLIOCARDIINAE; ATLANTIC; NUTRITION; ADJACENT,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - P.P.

Out of the more than 3500 <i>Bathyporeia</i> specimens investigated, 44% contained ciliates. Although <i>Bathyporeia sarsi </i> Watkin, 1938 was significantly more often infested than <i>Bathyporeia pilosa</i> Lindström, 1855, these differences in infestation rates were largely due to differences between water bodies with higher infestation rates in the polyhaline than in the mesohaline reach. Observation of additionally collected living specimens and freshly preserved material showed that at least two, and likely three, species of ciliates are present of which two might be undescribed so far. One of the observed species matches <i>Zoothamnium nanum</i> Kahl, 1933. A second species belongs to the genus <i>Epistylis</i> Ehrenberg, 1830, but does not seem to match a so far known species. This also accounts for a possible third species belonging to the genus <i>Zoothamnium</i> Bory de St. Vincent, 1826, deviating from <i>Z. nanum</i> amongst others in the habitus of the stalk. The front part of <i>Bathyporeia</i> spp. and the antennae in particular, significantly more often harboured ciliates than the remainder of the body, where additional ciliates were only found on the ventral side. This shows that the peritrich ciliates benefit from the water currents induced by the basibiont, providing food items, but might also indicate that <i>Bathyporeia</i> spp. benefits from the presence of the epibionts as they are most prevalent on the body parts that are easiest to clean.

Using a classic question regarding the frequency of paired fin loss in teleost fishes as a case study, we sought to create automated methods to facilitate the integration of broad-scale trait data with a sizable species-level phylogeny. Similar to the evolutionary pattern previously described for limbs, pelvic and pectoral fin reduction and loss are thought to have occurred independently multiple times in the evolution of fishes. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify the presence and absence of pectoral and pelvic fins of 12,582 species. To do this, we integrated a synthetic morphological supermatrix of phenotypic data for the pectoral and pelvic fins for teleost fishes from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (two presence/absence characters for 3,047 taxa) with a species-level tree for teleost fishes from the Open Tree of Life project (38,419 species). The integration method detailed herein harnessed a new combined approach by utilizing data based on ontological inference, as well as phylogenetic propagation, to reduce overall data loss. Using inference enabled by ontology-based annotations, missing data were reduced from 98.0% to 85.9%, and further reduced to 34.8% by phylogenetic data propagation. These methods allowed us to extend the data to an additional 11,293 species for a total of 12,582 species with trait data. The pectoral fin appears to have been independently lost in a minimum of 19 lineages and the pelvic fin in 48. Though interpretation is limited by lack of phylogenetic resolution at the species level, it appears that following loss, both pectoral and pelvic fins were regained several (3) to many (14) times respectively. Focused investigation into putative regains of the pectoral fin, all within one clade (Anguilliformes), showed that the pectoral fin was regained at least twice following loss. Overall, this study points to specific teleost clades where strategic phylogenetic resolution and genetic investigation will be necessary to understand the pattern and frequency of pectoral fin reversals.","Jackson, L.M.; Fernando, P.C.; Hanscom, J.S.; Balhoff, J.P.; Mabee, P.M.",WOS:000439717700001,"Jackson, Laura, L.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/sysbio/syx098,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Fishes, ""Inference""",Phenotype,ontology; ancestral state reconstruction; paired fins; phenotype; evolutionary morphology; missing data; bioinformatics pipeline ,Journal article,,,"Univ South Dakota, Dept Biol, 414 East Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",USA,Ancestral state reconstruction; bioinformatics pipeline; evolutionary morphology; fishes; inference; missing data; ontology; paired fins; phenotype,PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; GENETIC-BASIS; EVOLUTION; ONTOLOGIES; STICKLEBACKS; TAXONOMY; PERSPECTIVE; DIVERSITY; FAMILIES,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,University of South Dakota,x,USA,,University,Science

Here, we investigate whether genome size is positively correlated with latitude across 275 species of decapods, amphipods and copepods. We also test whether this relationship is independent of other factors that co-vary with genome size and latitude (body size, habitat and larval development) using phylogenetic generalized least-squares methods and model selection using Akaike’s information criterion. In amphipods, all well-supported models explaining genome size included latitude, whereas in copepods the supported models included body size, but not latitude. In decapods, there was a significant correlation between genome size and number of larval stages; however, model testing indicated that no single factor was most well supported in explaining genome size correlations. Although genome size generally increases with latitude across crustaceans, it is clearly a complex trait that differs among taxonomic groups.","Hultgren, K.M.; Jeffery, N.W.; Moran, A.; Gregory, T.R.",WOS:000423313000008,"Hultgren, K.M.","Seattle Univ, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98118 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/biolinnean/blx153,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,body size; crustacean; genome size; larval development; latitude;temperature; size rule,Journal article,,,"Seattle Univ, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98118 USA.",USA,body size; crustacean; genome size; larval development; latitude; temperature; size rule,BODY-SIZE; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT RATES; BERGMANNS RULE; METABOLIC-RATE; CLUTCH SIZE; DNA CONTENT; CELL-SIZE; EGG SIZE; TEMPERATURE,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,Seattle University,,USA,,University,Science

While the role of spatial scale in determining autocorrelation patterns in ecological populations has been noted, the effects of changing sampling effort (e.g., sample size) have rarely been explored; neither have the <i>nature</i> of any changes with sample size. Invertebrate assemblages were sampled from a single grid lattice comprised of 48 sampling stations at four sample sizes (0.0015, 0.0026, 0.0054 and 0.01 m<sup>2</sup>). Four metrics were investigated: assemblage abundance, frequency (species density), and numbers of the two most abundant species in the area <i>Simplisetia erythraeensis</i> and <i>Prionospio sexoculata</i>. Spatial autocorrelation was estimated for each sample size from the global Moran’s <i>I</i>. For a range of distance classes, Moran’s <i>I</i> correlograms were constructed, these plotted autocorrelation estimates as a function of the separation distance between point samples. Spatial autocorrelation was present in three of the metrics (assemblage abundance frequency and <i>Prionospio</i> abundance), but not for <i>Simplisetia</i> abundance. The estimated magnitude of spatial autocorrelation varied across sampling units for all four assemblage and species metrics (global Moran’s <i>I</i> ranged from 0.5 to − 0.07). Correlograms indicated that optimal sampling interval distances fell in the region of 8 m for <i>Simplisetia</i> and 19 m for the remaining three metrics. These distances indicate the dimensions of the processes (both biotic and abiotic) that determine spatial patterning in the microbenthic intertidal invertebrates sampled.","Hamylton, S.M.; Barnes, R.S.K.",WOS:000427080900018,"Hamylton, S.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-017-3491-x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Sampling effort, Sample size, Moran’s I correlogram, Moran’s I ",Journal article,,,"Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",Australia,Sampling effort; Sample size; Moran's I correlogram; Moran's I,BENTHIC MACROFAUNA; SEAGRASS; SCALE; PATTERN; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; RESOLUTION; SANDFLAT; BED,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Wollongong - School of Earth & Environment Sciences,x,,,,

As numerous land-based studies have shown that wind turbines can cause high fatality rates amongst bats Rijkswaterstaat started a bat monitoring programme for 2015 and 2016 in order to reduce uncertainties about possible impacts. At the same time Eneco commissioned a bat monitoring programme for 2015 and 2016 as part of the Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (MEP) for the offshore windfarm Luchterduinen. In 2016 Gemini conducted a bat monitoring campaign in windfarm Buitengaats and Wageningen Marine Research executed a bat monitoring programme at Wintershall platform P6-A and offshore research station FINO3 in the same year. The joint monitoring effort included 12 different offshore locations and 5 locations at the coast. The specific aims of these monitoring programmes are an assessment of : 1. The species composition at sea and at the coast. 2. The spatiotemporal pattern of occurrence, including the flight height. 3. The relation between environmental conditions and the occurrence of bats. 4. The function of the Dutch Territorial Sea for bats. The monitoring results at the coast showed that Nathusius’ pipistrelle is very common during both spring and autumn migration, but is also regular throughout the summer. It is also the most frequently recorded species at sea, albeit much less frequently recorded in comparison to the coast. At sea it was recorded from late August until late October (and one observation in November), and –to a lesser extent- from early April until the end of June. There were no records in July until mid-August. The observed pattern of occurrence matches previous offshore monitoring studies in the German and Dutch North Sea.","Lagerveld, S.; Gerla, D.; van der Wal, J.T.; de Vries, P.; Brabant, R.; Stienen, E.; Deneudt, K.; Manshanden, J.; Scholl, M.",,"Lagerveld, Sander, S.",,,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,Bats,,offshore wind energy; bat detector research,Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the present work was focused on the proteomic analyses of whole-body extract from the unexplored sea anemone <i>Bunodactis verrucosa</i>. The proteomic analyses applied were based on two methods: two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF and shotgun proteomic approach. In total, 413 proteins were identified, but only eight proteins were identified from gel-based analyses. Such proteins are mainly involved in basal metabolism and biosynthesis of antibiotics as the most relevant pathways. In addition, some putative toxins including metalloproteinases and neurotoxins were also identified. These findings reinforce the significance of the production of antimicrobial compounds and toxins by sea anemones, which play a significant role in defense and feeding.

Conversely, two Oedicerotidae regarded as separate morphospecies clustered together with divergences in the order of intraspecific variation.

This makes them excellent ecological indicators in rivers and lakes. They are routinely used to assess ecological quality of rivers and lakes using microscopy, which is time consuming. An alternative is to determine species in samples based on short DNA barcodes and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Former studies showed that community structure and water quality assessments based on diatoms deliver similar results with both methods. But, none evaluated if diversities were assessed in the same way despite the importance of this ecological metric. Based on littoral benthic samplings carried out in 56 pristine alpine lakes, we compared different diversity indices measured with microscopy and metabarcoding. Each lake was sampled in three different places of its littoral. We showed that α (diversity measured in a single sampling site of a given lake) and ϒ (total diversity in a lake where three independent samples were considered) diversities obtained with HTS were higher than those obtained with microscopy. This may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect morphologically cryptic species and to better detect rare taxa. On the other hand, β diversity obtained with HTS was smaller, which may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect very rare species and free-floating extracellular DNA. Nevertheless, diversity indices obtained with both methodologies were well correlated each other. This study validates the possibility to assess diatom diversity with HTS in a comparable way to the classical microscopic analysis.","Rimet, F.; Vasselon, V.; A.-Keszte, B.; Bouchez, A.",WOS:000427516200005,"Rimet, Frédéric, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13127-018-0359-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bacillariophyceae,,,Diatom; Diversity; Environmental DNA; Metabarcoding; OTU ,Journal article,,,"INRA, UMR CARRTEL, 75bis Ave Corzent, F-74203 Thonon Les Bains, France.",France,Diatom; Diversity; Environmental DNA; Metabarcoding; OTU,DIATOM COMMUNITIES; RDNA SEQUENCES; NITZSCHIA; RARE; IDENTIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; ALGAE,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,INRA French National Institute for Agricultural Research,x,France,,Research institute,Science

However, this diversity is threatened by an increasing population on the islands, ongoing destructive fishing techniques and lately by an increase in tourism. Protecting and managing the future use of BNP resources will require the assessment of both, local marine biodiversity through monitoring efforts and the identification and subsequent reduction of any threats or changes in the park. A high diversity in marine Heterobranchia indicates a high diversity of metazoan life forms and a diverse habitat structure. Surveying the complete biological diversity across taxonomic groups found in BNP would be an extensive undertaking, so focus on heterobranch diversity as an indicator of coral reef health was initiated and a model group on which future monitoring and conservation efforts can be based is provided. This study follows up the first investigation of marine Heterobranchia in BNP, conducted 12 years ago, while assessing molluscan diversity, and intends to present a base line for future monitoring programs.  Results  The diversity of marine heterobranchs around BNP was surveyed with an emphasis on Bunaken Island by diving and snorkeling at nearly 20 sites. Species are listed with photographic documentation (81 species) and results compared with the former study on molluscan species diversity in BNP. Taking these two studies into account 135 species are now recorded from BNP. The low overlap of described species (21) between the two BNP studies illustrates the gap of knowledge about overall species diversity in this particular area. A comparison with other studies from the region and Indo-Pacific also provides evidence for undersampling, but show similar taxa composition except of a somewhat higher cladobranch number in relation to Anthobranchia.  Conclusions  BNP is still under-sampled with regard to sea slug diversity. Thus conclusions as to whether or not a shift in species has occurred during the 12 years since the first study cannot be drawn. More and extensive studies are necessary to completely document the species richness in this area.","Kaligis, F.; Eisenbarth, J.-H.; Schillo, D.; Dialao, J.; Schäberle, T.F.; Böhringer, N.; Bara, R.; Reumschüssel, S.; König, G.M.; Wägele, H.",,"König, Gabriele, G.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s41200-018-0136-3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,BiodiversityBunaken national parkDivingHeterobranchiaIndonesiaMonitoring“Opisthobranchs”Tourism,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morpho-functional traits were investigated both singularly and together and showed significant differences related to these environmental factors. The greatest taxonomical and morpho-functional diversity was found in medium-coarse sand (M-CS) and at an intermedium energy level (IEL). The M-CS and IEL were probably richer in micro-habitats and subject to a low selective pressure, hosting nematodes with a wide range of adaptations. The mirroring of morpho-functional diversity with taxonomical diversity is crucial for the future growth of the use of nematodes in biomonitoring.

However, inferences on bathymetric ranges of marine invertebrates are usually based on a few taxa or on restricted regional scales. In this study, we present a comprehensive literature survey of hydroids for the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent Arctic and Antarctic seas for records deeper than 50 m. We used these records in bathymetrical analyses along latitude and compared major patterns under an evolutionary framework. Our results show that hydroids are frequent inhabitants of the deep sea with mainly eurybathic species that extend their distributions from shallower to deeper waters, being rarely exclusively bathyal or abyssal. We also found increasing bathymetric ranges with mean depths of occurrence of the species for both families and regions. Moreover, vertical distribution proved to be taxonomically and regionally dependent, with reduced eurybathy in “Antarctic” species but increased eurybathy in “Tropical” and “Subtropical North” regions. Data also support early colonization of the deep sea in the evolution of the group. Finally, the unequal number of records across latitudes, scant at Equatorial and southern Tropical latitudes, provides evidence to the historically uneven sampling effort in the different regions of the Atlantic.","Fernandez, M.O.; Marques, A.C.",WOS:000429293400004,"Fernandez, Marina, M.O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2018.01.008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Hydrozoa,,,Depth range; Deep-sea benthos; Eurybathy; Latitude; Hydrozoa; Atlantic Ocean,Journal article,,,"Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, R Matao,Trav 14,101, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",Brazil,Depth range; Deep-sea benthos; Eurybathy; Latitude; Hydrozoa; Atlantic Ocean,SEA INVASION; PRESSURE TOLERANCES; HYDROZOA CNIDARIA; MARINE HYDROIDS; DIVERSITY; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; ORIGIN; LIFE; TEMPERATURE,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of São Paulo (USP) - Institute of Bioscience,x,,,,

They have been studied for decades and a considerable number of papers reporting new halophilic species are being published every year. However, an extensive collection of these salt-loving organisms does not exist nowadays. Halophilic life forms have representatives from all three life domains, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya.

In the era of robust molecular evolutionary analysis, clock calibration is still one of the most basic steps needing attention. When fossil records are limited, well-dated geological events are the main resource for calibration. However, biogeographic calibrations have often been used in a simplistic manner, for example assuming simultaneous vicariant divergence of multiple sister lineages. Here, we propose a novel <i>iterative calibration</i> approach to define the most appropriate calibration date by seeking congruence between the dates assigned to multiple allopatric divergences and the geological history. Exploring patterns of molecular divergence in 16 trans-Bering sister clades of echinoderms, we demonstrate that the iterative calibration is predominantly advantageous when using complex geological or climatological events—such as the opening/reclosure of the Bering Strait—providing a powerful tool for clock dating that can be applied to other biogeographic calibration systems and further taxa. Using Bayesian analysis, we observed that evolutionary rate variability in the COI-5P gene is generally distributed in a clock-like fashion for Northern echinoderms. The results reveal a large range of genetic divergences, consistent with multiple pulses of trans-Bering migrations. A resulting rate of 2.8% pairwise Kimura-2-parameter sequence divergence per million years is suggested for the COI-5P gene in Northern echinoderms. Given that molecular rates may vary across latitudes and taxa, this study provides a new context for dating the evolutionary history of Arctic marine life.","Loeza-Quintana, T.; Adamowicz, S.J.",WOS:000426549300004,"Loeza-Quintana, Tzitziki, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00239-018-9831-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Echinodermata,,,Molecular dating; Clock calibration; Echinodermata; Bering Strait; DNA barcoding ,Journal article,,,"Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",Canada,Molecular dating; Clock calibration; Echinodermata; Bering Strait; DNA barcoding,ESTIMATING EVOLUTIONARY RATES; ARCTIC-OCEAN; ECHINODERMATA HOLOTHUROIDEA; SUBZERO TEMPERATURES; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; DIVERGENCE TIMES; GENERATION TIME; METABOLIC-RATE; BERING STRAIT; DNA EVOLUTION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Guelph,,Canada,,University,Science

Accordingly, its phylogeny should be considered for detailed analysis, namely by addressing molecular evidence for its different species. At the present time, a revisitation of Syndesmis is required and fully justified by the following lines of argument: (i) the body of knowledge on <i>Syndesmis</i> is large, but the information is scattered through many different works in the literature; (ii) for about 60 years, it was a common practice to assign the umagillids isolated from sea urchins as a single species, i.e. the type-species, <i>Syndesmis echinorum</i> François, 1886, which was later split into several species on morphological grounds; and (iii) the type-species - for which no molecular information is available - was redescribed and new species were described in recent years but the generic diagnosis of  <i>Syndesmis</i> was not emended accordingly. The present state of art additionally justifies the necessity of (i) an updated synopsis of species and (ii) an identification key to the 26 species described from different hosts and geographical locations.

This study documents foraminiferal diversity, abundance and incidences of test deformities in Salwa Bay, near the Saudi Arabia−Qatar Border. The total time-averaged (live + dead) benthic foraminiferal assemblage was dominated by porcelaneous taxa (85%). The three most abundant species were <i>Peneroplis pertusus</i> (24%), <i>P. planatus</i> (15%), and <i>Coscinospira hemprichii</i> (9%), accounting for nearly half of the total assemblage.

About a quarter of the specimens picked were living (rose Bengal stained) at the time of collection, and 43% of the tests of the most common taxa were mildly to severely deformed. Types of deformities included fusion of two adults or double tests, protuberances on the spiral side, abnormal chamber arrangement, abnormal shape of the proloculus, dents, re-positioning of the aperture, and modification of the coiling plane. Two genera accounted for three quarters of the observed test deformities: <i>Peneroplis</i> (58%) and <i>Coscinospira</i> (17%). The combination of elevated temperatures, high salinities, and the ecology of the taxa encountered is likely responsible for the abundance, relatively low diversity, and high incidence of deformities in foraminiferal tests from Salwa Bay.

High-throughput DNA sequencing methods provide valuable tools for examining these complex interactions, although this remains challenging, as many microorganisms are difficult to isolate, identify and culture. We use two species of planktonic foraminifera from the climatically susceptible, palaeoceanographically important genus <i>Neogloboquadrina</i>, as ideal test microorganisms for the application of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. <i>Neogloboquadrina dutertrei </i> and <i>Neogloboquadrina incompta</i> were collected from the California Current and subjected to either 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, fluorescence microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate their species-specific trophic interactions and potential symbiotic associations. 53±99% of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from two specimens of N. dutertrei were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) from a chloroplast of the phylum Stramenopile. TEM observations confirmed the presence of numerous intact coccoid algae within the host cell, consistent with algal symbionts. Based on sequence data and observed ultrastructure, we taxonomically assign the putative algal symbionts to Pelagophyceae and not Chrysophyceae, as previously reported in this species. In addition, our data shows that N. dutertrei feeds on protists within particulate organic matter (POM), but not on bacteria as a major food source. In total contrast, of OTUs recovered from three <i>N. incompta</i> specimens, 83±95% were assigned to bacterial classes Alteromonadales and Vibrionales of the order Gammaproteobacteria. TEM demonstrates that these bacteria are a food source, not putative symbionts. Contrary to the current view that non-spinose foraminifera are predominantly herbivorous, neither <i>N. dutertrei </i> nor <i>N. incompta</i> contained significant numbers of phytoplankton OTUs.

The sector now produces 44% of total food fish production. Increasing demand and consumption from a growing global population are driving further expansion of both inland and marine aquaculture (i.e., mariculture, including marine species farmed on land). However, the growth of mariculture is dependent on the availability of suitable farming areas for new facilities, particularly for open farming practices that rely on the natural oceanic environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll etc. In this study, we estimated the marine areas within the exclusive economic zones of all countries that were suitable for potential open ocean mariculture activities. To this end, we quantify the environmental niche and inferred the global habitat suitability index (HSI) of the 102 most farmed marine species using four species distribution models. The average weighted HSI across the four models suggests that 72,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ocean are to be environmentally suitable to farm one or more species. About 92% of the predicted area (66,000,000 km2) is environmentally suitable for farming finfish, 43% (31,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>) for molluscs and 54% (39,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>) for crustaceans. These predictions do not consider technological feasibility that can limit crustaceans farming in open waters. Suitable mariculture areas along the Atlantic coast of South America and West Africa appear to be most under-utilized for farming. Our results suggest that factors other than environmental considerations such as the lack of socio-economic and technological capacity, as well as aqua feed supply are currently limiting the potential for mariculture expansion in many areas.","Oyinlola, M.A.; Reygondeau, G.; Wabnitz, C.C.C.; Troell, M.; Cheung, W.W.L.",WOS:000422911300047,"Reygondeau, Gabriel, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0191086,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Nippon Fdn Nereus Program & Changing Ocean Res Un, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",Canada,,BASS DICENTRARCHUS-LABRAX; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SITE SELECTION; SHELLFISH AQUACULTURE; CARRYING-CAPACITY; GROWTH-RATE; FISH-MEAL; FOOD; ECOSYSTEM; IMPACTS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of British Columbia - Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries - Nippon Foundation Nereus Program,x,Canada,,Research institute,Science

Due to the harsh climate, shipping activities in Arctic waters have been limited compared to many parts of the world but will increase in the coming years due to climate changes. This will potentially affect the pristine Arctic marine ecosystems by introduction of NIS. In this chapter, we present the international ballast water regulations that have entered into force and the specific challenges of ballast water management in relation to the Arctic environment and marine ecosystems. We discuss the risk of NIS affecting the Arctic marine ecosystems including the impact of increased shipping activity, changes in living conditions of marine organisms because of climate changes and lack of knowledge of the eco-physiological boundaries and distributions of Arctic marine species. It is concluded that at present only a few marine NIS have been recorded in the Arctic area. Despite the existing and planned ballast water regulations, NIS establishment in the region will increase with an unknown magnitude due to lack of biological data.","Holbech, H.; Pedersen, K.L.",WOS:000467588800008,"Holbech, Henrik, H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-67365-3_7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Ship’s ballast water; Ballast water regulations; Nonindigenous invasive species; Climate changes; Arctic marine ecosystems; IMO; HELCOM/OSPAR; US Coast Guard ,Book chapters,,,"Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Odense, Denmark.",Denmark,Ship's ballast water; Ballast water regulations; Nonindigenous invasive species; Climate changes; Arctic marine ecosystems; IMO; HELCOM/OSPAR; US Coast Guard,RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTRODUCTIONS; RICHNESS; SHIPS,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Fisheries; Law,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Fisheries; Government & Law,Syddansk Universitet - Department of Biology,,Denmark,,University,Science

Nevertheless, most species distribution models (SDMs) still focus solely on environment-species relationships to predict the occurrence of species. Furthermore, the currently used indirect estimates of movement allow to assess habitat accessibility, but do not provide an accurate description of movement. Better proxies of movement are needed to assess the dispersal potential of individual species and to gain a more practical insight in the interconnectivity of communities. Telemetry techniques are rapidly evolving and highly capable to provide explicit descriptions of movement, but their usefulness for SDMs will mainly depend on the ability of these models to deal with hitherto unconsidered ecological processes. More specifically, the integration of movement is likely to affect the environmental data requirements as the connection between environmental and biological data is crucial to provide reliable results. Mobility implies the occupancy of a continuum of space, hence an adequate representation of both geographical and environmental space is paramount to study mobile species distributions. In this context, environmental models, remote sensing techniques and animal-borne environmental sensors are discussed as potential techniques to obtain suitable environmental data. In order to provide an in-depth review of the aforementioned methods, we have chosen to use the modelling of fish distributions as a case study. The high mobility of fish and the often highly variable nature of the aquatic environment generally complicate model development, making it an adequate subject for research. Furthermore, insight into the distribution of fish is of great interest for fish stock assessments and water management worldwide, underlining its practical relevance.","Bruneel, S.; Gobeyn, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.",WOS:000432462000092,"Reubens, Jan, J.",Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.026,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,Telemetry,,Species distributions; Fish movement; Environmental data collection,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Species distributions; Fish movement; Environmental data collection; Telemetry,CORAL-REEF FISHES; PIKE ESOX-LUCIUS; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; MECHANISTIC MODELS; UNDERWATER VIDEO; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; NEXT-GENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The autochthonous association, which originally lived in an environment located in the infralittoral and upper circalittoral stages of the benthic marine domain, is cyclically affected by inputs from the more superficial environments due to the presence of relatively well-developed lagoon and/or estuary environments in the surrounding coastal areas. Within the ostracod association, the presence of <i>Bythocythere turgida</i> – a true “northern guest” – is particularly significant. This species indicates that these sediments were deposited during the cold phases of the Early Pleistocene. Among the ostracods found, those belonging to the families Trachyleberididae, Hemicytheridae and Bythocytheridae, which are dominant and include particularly significant species from the environmental and paleoclimatic point of view, are systematically recorded and commented on.

Harvested organisms that die or are discarded before a point of sale are regularly not reported. For the global marine aquarium trade, identifying supply-chain losses is necessary to more accurately assess exploitation from trade data. We examined quality control rejections and mortality of marine invertebrates (Asteroidea, Gastropoda, Malacostraca, Ophiuroidea) moving through the Papua New Guinea marine aquarium supply-chain, from fisher to importer. Utilizing catch invoices and exporter mortality records we determined that, over a 160 day period, 38.6% of the total invertebrate catch (n = 13,299 individuals) was lost before export. Supply-chain losses were divided among invertebrates rejected in the quality control process (11.5%) and mortality of the accepted catch in transit to, and during holding at, an export facility (30.6%). A further 0.3% died during international transit to importers. We quantified supply-chain losses for the ten most fished species which accounted for 96.4% of the catch. Quality control rejections (n = 1533) were primarily explained by rejections of oversized invertebrates (83.2% of rejections). We suggest that enforceable size limits on species prone to size-based rejections and elimination of village-based holding of invertebrates would reduce losses along the Papua New Guinea supply-chain. This case study underscores that low mortality during international transit may mask large losses along supply-chains prior to export and exemplifies the limitations of trade data to accurately monitor exploitation.","Militz, T.A.; Kinch, J.; Southgate, P.C.",WOS:000427467900010,"Militz, Thane, T.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00267-018-1006-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Coral reefs, Aquarium fishery, Mortality, Quality control, Wildlife trade, Management ",Journal article,,,"Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Australia.",Australia,Coral reefs; Aquarium fishery; Mortality; Quality control; Wildlife trade; Management,POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MORTALITY; SUSTAINABILITY; FISHERY; STRESS; IMPACT; OPPORTUNITIES; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; NEMO,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of the Sunshine Coast,x,Australia,,University,Science

In all three species, the structure of the spermatozoon is biflagellate, with two incorporated trepaxonematan 9 + “1” axonemes and a posterior nucleus. However, unexpected structures were also seen. An alleged synapomorphy of the Polyopisthocotylea is the presence of a continuous row of longitudinal microtubules in the nuclear region. The sperm of <i>C. leptogaster</i> has a posterior part with a single axoneme, and the part with the nucleus is devoid of the continuous row of microtubules. The spermatozoon of <i>R. emarginata</i> has an anterior region with membrane ornamentation, and posterior lateral microtubules are absent.

Our main conclusion is that the synapomorphy “lateral microtubules in the principal region of the spermatozoon” does not define the Polyopisthocotylea but is restricted to the Mazocraeidea.","Justine, J.-L.; Poddubnaya, L.G.",WOS:000425084200001,"Poddubnaya, Larisa, L.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1051/parasite/2018007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Monogenea,,,"Monogenea, phylogeny, sperm ultrastructure",Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 51, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,Monogenea; phylogeny; sperm ultrastructure,2 MONOPISTHOCOTYLEAN MONOGENEANS; SPERM ULTRASTRUCTURE; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; AFLAGELLATE SPERMATOZOON; LEPTOGASTER LEUCKART; PARSIMONY ANALYSIS; FINE-STRUCTURE; PLATYHELMINTHES; SPERMATOGENESIS; PARASITE,Parasitology,Parasitology,"Joint Research Unit: Institue of Systematics, Evolution, Biodiversity (ISYEB) (UMR 7205)",x,France,,Research network,Science

Analyses reveal distinctive marks that are spread on the outer shell surface only. The marks are regular–unbranched–elongate, perpendicular to the outer shell growth lines, with deflections on the margins, never interconnected, without bifurcations, conforming bottom–up constructions. They occur in hundreds of specimens from many samples taken from sediments ranging in age from the late Pleistocene to the Recent. These marks have never been reported or described for this species and their origin and formation remain elusive. We describe these traces thoroughly and we propose an explanation for their preservation on about half the shells examined. Potential destructive boring structures (excavated from outside–in) or bioerosion activities by other macro- or micro-organisms are dismissed. These antimarginal asymmetric traces point instead to a process of constructive bioclaustrations (grown from the bottom–up) produced <i>in situ</i> during the life of the bivalve by unknown symbiont organisms. Additionally, the regular pattern observed for the marks exclude host growth as a consequence of abiotic/extrinsic causes.

In a previous study, we adapted AMBI for use in US coastal waters (US AMBI), but saw biases in salinity and score distribution when compared to locally calibrated indices. In this study we modified M-AMBI for US waters and compared its performance to that of US AMBI. Index performance was evaluated in three ways: 1) concordance with local indices presently being used as management tools in three geographic regions of US coastal waters, 2) classification accuracy for sites defined a priori as good or bad and 3) insensitivity to natural environmental gradients. US M-AMBI was highly correlated with all three local indices and removed the compression in response seen in moderately disturbed sites with US AMBI. US M-AMBI and US AMBI did a similar job correctly classifying sites as good or bad in local validation datasets (83–100% accuracy vs. 84–95%, respectively). US M-AMBI also removed the salinity bias of US AMBI so that lower salinity sites were not more likely to be incorrectly classified as impaired.

First appearing in the Lower Jurassic, there are now ~3500 species worldwide. Carideans experienced several independent transitions to freshwater from marine habitats, while many of the marine species have also evolved a symbiotic lifestyle. Here we use diversification rate analyses to test whether these ecological traits promote or inhibit diversity within a phylogenetic framework. We demonstrate that speciation rates are more than twice as high in freshwater clades, whilst symbiotic ecologies are associated with lower speciation rates. These lower rates amongst symbiotic species are of concern given that symbioses often occur in some of the most diverse, delicately balanced and threatened marine ecosystems.","Davis, K.E.; De Grave, S.; Delmer, C.; Wills, M.A.",WOS:000461126500016,"De Grave, Sammy, S.",Oxford University Museum of Natural History,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s42003-018-0018-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",England,,R PACKAGE; CRUSTACEA; DECAPODA; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; EXTINCTION; DIVERGENCE; PATTERNS; FASTER; SHIFT,Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Oxford - Museum of Natural History,,UK,,Museum,Science

Brooding females were analysed in terms of adult size, brood size and juvenile size with non-significant trends occurring with depth. Four brooding females were frozen straight after sampling and enabled the study of changes in elemental composition throughout embryo and early juvenile development with regard to their feeding mode. Morphological and elemental analyses indicate aseasonality of reproduction and lecithotrophic early ontogeny in this species. The most advanced juveniles found were significantly different from all earlier stages, with an increase in dry weight (DW) to 5.87 (± 1.08) mg suggesting growth, but a high C:N ratio of 8.60 (± 0.59) that would indicate lecithotrophy. However, as the increase in DW was attributed to an increase in carbon, but not to an increase in nitrogen, it was not possible for the food source to be of organic origin.","Thatje, S.; Steventon, E.; Heilmayer, O.",WOS:000434253800019,"Thatje, Sven, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00300-018-2285-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Asteroidea, ""Echinodermata""",,,"Echinodermata, Asteroidea, Reproduction, Brood protection, Cold adaptation, Southern Ocean ",Journal article,,,"Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",England,Echinodermata; Asteroidea; Reproduction; Brood protection; Cold adaptation; Southern Ocean,AMINO-ACID-TRANSPORT; BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES; ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; MCMURDO SOUND; BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; CALORIC CONTENT; EGG SIZE; REPRODUCTION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NOC (National Oceanography Centre),x,,,,

However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors facilitating invasion dynamics and their interactions are still largely unknown. This study compiles and inputs available data for the NIS bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis across the invaded biogeographic range in the Mediterranean basin into a species distribution model to predict future spread under a range of marine scenarios. Location:  Mediterranean Sea. Methods: A systematic review produced the largest presence database ever assembled to inform the selection of biological, chemical and physical factors linked to the spread of <i>B. pharaonis</i> through the Suez Canal. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to simulate current and future trophic and salinity scenarios. A species distribution model was run to determine key drivers of invasion, quantify interactive impacts arising from a range of trophic states, salinity conditions and climatic scenarios and forecast future trajectories for the spread of NIS into new regions under multiple-parameter scenarios (based on the main factors identified from the systematic review). Results:  Impacts on invasion trajectory arising from climate change and interactions with increasing salinity from the new opening of the canal were the primary drivers of expansion across the basin, the effects of which were further enhanced by eutrophication. Predictions of the current distribution were most accurate when multiple stressors were used to drive the model. A habitat suitability index developed at a subcontinental scale from model outputs identified novel favourable conditions for future colonization at specific locations under 2030 and 2050 climatic scenarios. Main conclusions:  Future expansion of B. pharaonis will be enhanced by climatefacilitated increased sea temperature, interacting with increasing pressures from salinity and eutrophication. The spatially explicit risk output maps of invasions represent a powerful visual product for use in communication of the spread of NIS and decision-support tools for scientists and policymakers. The suggested approach, the observed distribution pattern and driving processes can be applied to other NIS species and regions by providing novel forecasts of species occurrences under future multiple stressor scenarios and the location of suitable recipient habitats with respect to anthropogenic and environmental parameters.","Sara, G.; Porporato, E.M.D.; Mangano, M.C.; Mieszkowska, N.",WOS:000431734300012,"Mangano, Maria Cristina, M.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.13184,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",Mediterranean,Brachidontes pharaonis,Climate change,,habitat fragmentation; invasive species; sensitivity analysis; species distribution model,Journal article,,,"Marine Biol Assoc UK, Plymouth, Devon, England.",England,Brachidontes pharaonis; climate change; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; Mediterranean Sea; sensitivity analysis; species distribution model,SPECIES-RANGE SHIFTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; INVASIONS; PATHWAYS; IMPACTS; TRADE,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Marine Biological Association (MBA),,UK,,Research institute,Science

Among these, the silver-cheeked toad-fish <i>Lagocephalus sceleratus</i> (Gmelin, 1789) has rapidly colonised the eastern Mediterranean basin and is currently moving westwards. This pufferfish has a highly opportunistic behaviour, it attacks fish captured in nets and lines and seriously damages fishing gears and catch. It is a highly-toxic species with no immediate economic value for the Mediterranean market, although it currently represents 4% of the weight of the total artisanal catches. Consequently, the possible effects on Mediterranean fisheries and health require to enhance our understanding about the future geographical distribution of this pufferfish in the whole basin.  In this paper, an overall habitat suitability map and an effective geographical spread map for <i>L. sceleratus</i> at Mediterranean scale are produced by using cloud computing-based algorithms to merge seven machine learning approaches. Further, the potential impact of the species is estimated for several Mediterranean Sea subdivisions: The major fishing areas of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Economic Exclusive Zones, and the subdivisions of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Sea. Our results suggest that without an intervention, <i>L. sceleratus</i> will continue its rapid spread and will likely have a high impact on fisheries.

Here, we describe risk assessment for nineteen ascidian species and predict coastal regions that are more vulnerable to arrival and expansion. Location:  Global. Methods:  We used ensemble niche modelling with three algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and MaxEnt) to predict ecologically suitable areas and evaluated our predictions using independent (area under the curve—AUC) and dependent thresholds (true skill statistics—TSS). Environmental variables were maximum and the range of sea surface temperature, mean salinity and maximum chlorophyll. We used our niche modelling results and a modified invasibility index to compare invasion risk among 15 coastal regions. Results:  Currently, the most invaded regions are in temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and Temperate Australasia, which are regions most prone for new invasions. In the tropics, the West and Central Indo-Pacific are two regions of strong concern, the former with high risk of primary invasion by <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i> and <i>Didemnum perlucidum</i>. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Southwest and Southeast Atlantic are most at risk, both subject to invasion by <i>Botrylloides violaceus</i>, <i>Didemnum vexillum, Molgula manhattensis</i> and <i>Styela clava</i> among others. Regions most at risk of expansion of established invasive species are the Central Indo-Pacific, Northwest Pacific, Mediterranean and West Indo-Pacific. Main conclusions:  All regions studied have areas that are suitable and connected to receive new ascidian introductions or that may permit the spread of already established species. Risk comparison of primary introductions and expansion of established introduced ascidians among regions will allow managers to prioritize species of concern for each region both for monitoring future introductions or to enforce control actions towards established species to decrease the risk of regional expansion.","Lins, D.M.; Andrade, A.F.A.; de Marco Jr., P.; Rocha, R.M.",WOS:000430103900011,"Rocha, Rosana, R.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12711,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Tunicata,Risk assessment,,"ecological niche modelling; modelling, invasibility index; invasion debt; marine trade; Species distribution models ",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The decline of marine biodiversity worldwide has raised concerns about effects on ecosystems. To examine biodiversity trends of Narragansett Bay over time, a list was compiled of all benthic invertebrate species collected from the bay since 1834. The list covers 104 studies spanning 182 years and currently holds 1214 unique taxa from 21 phyla, the majority of all animal phyla on Earth. A permuted estimator of number of species suggested there are about 300 more yet to be discovered. Widely varying sampling gear and sieve mesh sizes precluded the use of abundance data. Instead, multidimensional scaling and taxonomic distinctness were used with presence-absence data to examine biodiversity trends. The changes in community composition and decline of benthic biodiversity (<i>p</i> < 0.01) since 1855 are what would be expected of a community that gradually deteriorated in the face of increasing anthropogenic stressors. Taxonomic distinctness had negative correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with human population in the watershed, total nitrogen inputs, and inputs of metals. This loss of benthic biodiversity has implications for ecosystem functions and services. As some of the stressors waned in the last two or three decades, following passage of environmental legislation in the 1970s, biodiversity appeared to show a partial recovery. An inventory of species, how it has changed over time, and understanding what caused those changes are important for assessing whether remediation programs are achieving improved water quality and ecosystem health.","Hale, S.S.; Buffum, H.W.",WOS:000439796200001,"Hughes, Melissa, M.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12237-018-0378-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Marine benthic invertebrates, Biodiversity, Taxonomic distinctness, Historical trends, Narragansett Bay ",Journal article,,,"US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Off Res & Dev, 27 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",USA,Marine benthic invertebrates; Biodiversity; Taxonomic distinctness; Historical trends; Narragansett Bay,NARRAGANSETT BAY; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SEDIMENT BIODIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY; NORTH-AMERICA; RHODE-ISLAND; WADDEN SEA; COMMUNITY; OCEAN,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA),x,USA,,Governmental body,Policy

We sampled communities during three seasons, i.e., in autumn, spring, and summer. Using classical taxonomy, 107 taxa/morphotypes were identified in the nine communities. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these individuals into 20 functional entities according to their values for 5 traits related to trophic adaptations (cell size, mobility, trophic regime, coloniality, and pelagic/benthic life). Some species (e.g., <i>Prorocentrum micans</i) emerged in multiple functional entities, showing the importance to consider intraspecific variability. The functional description of phytoplankton communities better reflected the hydrological functioning and the different eutrophication status of the lagoons than the taxonomic approach. Specific functional adaptations were identified in the nine communities. For example, phytoplankton organisms with heterotrophic and potentially mixotrophic abilities occurred when the availability of inorganic nutrient decreased, or when organic matter and small preys were potentially the main nutrient resources. The limitation has also favored small cells highly competitive for nutrients. Using functional indices together with taxonomic description has also helped revealing important aspects of community assembly, such as competitive exclusion in summer.","Leruste, A.; Villéger, S.; Malet, N.; De Wit, R.; Bec, B.",WOS:000428815800015,"Leruste, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-018-3565-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Classification,,Functional entity; Functional traits; Taxonomic diversity ,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, UMR Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, IRD, Ifremer,CNRS, Bat 24,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",France,Classification; Functional entity; Functional traits; Taxonomic diversity,MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; TRAITS; SIZE; CLASSIFICATION; DISTURBANCE; MICROSCOPY; FRAMEWORK,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,"Joint Research Unit: Biodiversité Marine, Exploitation et Conservation (MARBEC) (UMR 9190)",x,France,,Research network,Science

However, different tracking methods provide different data resolutions, ranging from < 10 m to > 100 km. To better understand the implications of this variation, we modeled the potential distribution of black-browed albatrosses <i>Thalassarche melanophris</i> from South Georgia that were simultaneously equipped with a platform terminal transmitter (PTT) (high resolution) and a global location sensor (GLS) logger (coarse resolution), and measured the overlap of the respective potential distribution for a total of nine different SDM algorithms. We found slightly better model fits for the PTT than for GLS data (AUC values 0.958 +/- 0.048 vs 0.95 +/- 0.05) across all algorithms. The overlaps of the predicted distributions were higher between device types for the same algorithm, than among algorithms for either device type. Uncertainty arising from coarse-resolution location data is therefore lower than that associated with the modeling technique. Consequently, the choice of an appropriate algorithm appears to be more important than device type when applying SDMs to seabird tracking data. Despite their low accuracy, GLS data appear to be effective for analyzing the habitat preferences and distribution patterns of pelagic species.","Quillfeldt, P.; Engler, J.O.; Silk, J.R.D.; Phillips, R.A.",WOS:000418276300006,"Silk, Janet, J.R.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jav.01238,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated genetic differentiation of species and populations of the free-living endobenthic nematode genera <i>Sabatieria</i> and <i>Desmodora</i> using nuclear 18S rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene sequences. Specimens were collected at continental shelf depths (200–500&nbsp;m) near the Antarctic Peninsula, Scotia Arc and eastern side of the Weddell Sea. The two nematode genera co-occurred at all sampled locations, but with different vertical distribution in the sediment. A combination of phylogenetic (GMYC, Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood) and population genetic (AMOVA) analyses were used for species delimitation and assessment of gene flow between sampling locations.  Results  Sequence analyses resulted in the delimitation of four divergent species lineages in <i>Sabatieria</i>, two of which could not be discriminated morphologically and most likely constitute cryptic species. Two species were recognised in <i>Desmodora</i>, one of which showed large intraspecific morphological variation. Both genera comprised species that were restricted to one side of the Weddell Sea and species that were widely spread across it. Population genetic structuring was highly significant and more pronounced in the deeper sediment-dwelling <i>Sabatieria</i> species, which are generally less prone to resuspension and passive dispersal in the water column than surface <i>Desmodora</i> species.  Conclusions  Our results indicate that gene flow is restricted at large geographic distance in the Southern Ocean, which casts doubt on the efficiency of the Weddell gyre and Antarctic Circumpolar Current in facilitating circum-Antarctic nematode species distributions. We also show that genetic structuring and cryptic speciation can be very different in nematode species isolated from the same geographic area, but with different habitat preferences (surface versus deeper sediment layers).","Hauquier, F.; Leliaert, F.; Rigaux, A.; Derycke, S.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000402641000001,"Derycke, Sofie, S.","Operational Directorate Taxonomy and Phylogeny, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS)",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s12862-017-0968-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Desmodora de Man, 1889, ""Nematoda"", ""Sabatieria Rouville, 1903""",,,Antarctica; Continental shelf; Cryptic species; Desmodora; Dispersal;Nematoda; Phylogeny; Population genetics; Sabatieria,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Antarctica; Continental shelf; Cryptic species; Desmodora; Dispersal; Nematoda; Phylogeny; Population genetics; Sabatieria,MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION; DISPERSAL; SPECIATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; INVERTEBRATES; BIODIVERSITY,Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,RBINS Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS),,,,,

Four species are currently recognised, all from fishes collected in Japanese waters but each from different perciform families: a labrid, a scarid, a sparid and pinguipeds. We report on a new species, <i>Choerodonicola arothokoros</i> n. sp., from the blue-barred parrotfish <i>Scarus ghobban</i> Forsskål (Scaridae) collected in subtropical waters of Moreton Bay, south-east Queensland, Australia. Using genetic sequence data for the ITS2 rDNA marker, we matched adult <i>C</i>. <i>arothokoros</i> to intramollsucan stages discovered in an intertidal gastropod <i>Herpetopoma atratum</i> (Gmelin) (Vetigastropoda: Chilodontidae) collected in close proximity to the fish hosts. Notably, the cercariae lack a penetration stylet and are among the smallest known in the Opecoelidae. We provide the first assessment of the phylogenetic position of <i>Choerodonicola</i> based on sequence data generated for the phylogenetically informative 18S and 28S rRNA coding regions, for <i>C</i>. <i>arothokoros</i> and also <i>C</i>. <i>renko</i> Machida, 2014, which we recollected from the yellowback seabream <i>Dentex hypselosomus</i> Bleeker from the fish market in Minabe, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan.

Margalef diversity appeared to be the best performing benthic index regarding these criteria, even better than several Multi-Metric Indices (MMIs) containing e.g. AMBI (AZTI Marine Biotic Index) and ITI (Infaunal Trophic Index). Therefore, this relatively simple and very practical index, including a new reference value estimation and modelling method, and BENMMI software were selected as a common OSPAR (Oslo Paris convention) method for the benthic fauna assessment of the Southern North Sea. This method was applied to benthic fauna data from the Southern North Sea collected during the period 2010–2015. The results in general show lower normalized Margalef values in coastal areas, and higher normalized Margalef values in deeper offshore areas. The following benthic indices were compared in this study: species richness, Margalef diversity, SNA index, Shannon index, PIE index, AMBI, ITI. For each assessment area, the least disturbed benthic dataset was selected as an adjacent 6 year period with, on average, the highest Margalef diversity values. For these datasets, the reference values were primarily set as the 99th percentile values of the respective indices. This procedure results in the highest stable reference values that are not outliers. In addition, a variable percentile method was developed, in which the percentile value is adjusted to the average bottom fishing pressure (according to data from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES) in the period 2009–2013. The adjusted percentile values were set by expert judgement, at 75th (low fishing pressure), 95th (medium fishing pressure) and 99th (high fishing pressure) percentile. The estimated reference values for Margalef diversity correlate quite well with the median depth of the assessment areas using a sigmoid model (pseudo-R2 = 0.86). This relationship between depth and Margalef diversity was used to estimate reference values in case an assessment area had insufficient benthic data .For testing the effects of bottom fishing pressure, normalized index values (NIV; index value divided by reference value) were used. The rationale for using NIVs is the assumption that, although a certain level of bottom fishing pressure will have a larger absolute effect on more biodiverse benthic communities in deeper waters than on more robust and less biodiverse coastal benthic communities, the relative effects (tested using NIVs) are comparable. A clear exponentially decreasing relationship (R2 = 0.26–0.27, p < 0.00001) was found between both bottom surface and subsurface fishing activity (penetration depth <2 cm and >2 cm, respectively) and normalized Margalef diversity values, with an asymptotic normalized Margalef value of 0.45 at a subsurface fishing activity >2.3 sweeps/year. This asymptotic value is predominantly found in coastal waters, and probably shows that the naturally more robust coastal benthic communities have been transformed into resilient benthic communities, which rapidly recover from increasing fishing pressure.","van Loon, W.M.G.M.; Walvoort, D.J.J.; Van Hoey, G.; Vina-Herbon, C.; Blandon, A.; Pesch, R.; Schmitt, P.; Scholle, J.; Heyer, K.; Lavaleye, M.S.S.; Phillips, G.; Duineveld, G.C.A.; Blomqvist, M.",WOS:000430760900066,"Duineveld, Gerard, G.C.A.",OCS,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.09.029,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,OSPAR;  MSFD;  Marine benthos;  Index;  MMI;  Multi-metric index;  Benthic assessment method;  Reference value estimation;  Model;  Margalef diversity;  Species richness;  AMBI;  ITI;  Shannon index;  PIE;  SN;  SNA;  Fishing pressure;  Organic enrichment;  Sedimentation,Journal article,,,"Rijkswaterstaat, Minist Infrastruct & Environm, Zuiderwagenpl 2, NL-8224 AD Lelystad, Netherlands.",Netherlands,OSPAR; MSFD; Marine benthos; Index; MMI; Multi-metric index; Benthic assessment method; Reference value estimation; Model; Margalef diversity; Species richness; AMBI; ITI; Shannon index; PIE; SN; SNA; Fishing pressure; Organic enrichment; Sedimentation,ECOLOGICAL QUALITY; FISHING IMPACTS; COMMUNITIES; INDEX; ECOSYSTEMS; RECOVERY; FISHERY; SHELF,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics (INOGS),,Italy,,Research institute,Science

Across the Arctic, loading of terrestrial/freshwater-derived organic carbon (C<sub>T</sub>) from watershed runoff and coastal erosion is predicted to increase with global warming, and may subsidize marine organic carbon as an energy source. To assess the importance of C<sub>T</sub>, we analyzed the trophic links and carbon assimilation pathways of twenty genera in five trophic guilds (suspension and filter feeders (Su/FF), surface and subsurface deposit feeders (Ss/De), epibenthic omnivorous invertebrates (Ep/Om), omnivorous fishes (Fish), and mammalian carnivores (Mam/Carn) as well as end-member organic matter (OM) sources.

This relationship is commonly attributed to preferential uptake of <sup>14</sup>N from sinking particulate organic matter (POM) by microbes, and suggests that relationships between δ<sup>15</sup>N and water depth may be affected by local POM sources and flux dynamics. We examined the relationships between δ<sup>15</sup>N and water depth (20–500 m) for six trophic functional groups using a mixed effects modelling approach, and compared relationships between two contiguous Arctic marine ecosystems with different POM sources and sinking export dynamics: the Canadian Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf. We demonstrate for the first time in the Arctic that δ<sup>15</sup>N values of mobile epifaunal carnivores increased as a function of depth when considered separately from benthopelagic and infaunal carnivores, which contrarily did not exhibit increasing δ<sup>15</sup>N with depth. The δ<sup>15</sup>N of suspension/filter feeders, infaunal deposit feeders and bulk sediment also increased with water depth, and the slopes of the relationships were steeper in the Amundsen Gulf than in the Beaufort Sea. We propose that regional differences in slopes reflect differences in POM sources exported to the benthos. In the Beaufort Sea, terrestrial POM discharged from the Mackenzie River quantitatively dominates the sedimentary organic matter across the continental shelf and slope, dampening change in δ<sup>15</sup>N of benthic POM with depth. In the Amundsen Gulf, we attribute a faster rate of change in δ<sup>15</sup>N of POM with increasing depth to larger contributions of marine-derived POM to the benthic sedimentary pool, which had likely undergone extensive biological transformation in the productive offshore pelagic zone. Differences in POM input regimes among regions should be considered when comparing food webs using stable isotopes, as such differences may impact the rate at which consumer δ<sup>15</sup>N changes with depth.","Stasko, A.D.; Bluhm, B.A.; Reist, J.D.; Swanson, H.; Power, M.",WOS:000432764000006,"Bluhm, Bodil, B.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2018.03.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pisces,,,Marine fish; Benthic invertebrates; Stable isotopes; Water depth; Arctic; Functional groups,Journal article,,,"Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",Canada,Marine fish; Benthic invertebrates; Stable isotopes; Water depth; Arctic; Functional groups,FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; CANADIAN BEAUFORT SHELF; STABLE-ISOTOPES; FEEDING ECOLOGY; FISH COMMUNITY; WATER MASS; SEA; CARBON; SLOPE; FLUXES,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Waterloo - Department of Biology,x,Canada,,University,Science

Most of these aquatic clades are larger bodied, on average, than their closest land-dwelling relatives, but the extent to which potential ecological, biomechanical, and physiological controls contributed to this pattern remains untested quantitatively. Here, we use previously published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in aquatic mammals through both comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record. Both methods indicate that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium.","Gearty, W.; McClain, C.R.; Payne, J.L.",WOS:000430191900070,"Gearty, William, W.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.1712629115,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,body mass; Ornstein–Uhlenbeck; metabolism; phylogenetic comparative methods; Mammalia,Journal article,,,"Stanford Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",USA,body mass; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck; metabolism; phylogenetic comparative methods; Mammalia,BENTHIC MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; BODY-SIZE; COPES RULE; STABILIZING SELECTION; TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; EXTINCTION RISK; BLUE WHALE; MASS; SPACE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Stanford University,x,USA,,University,Science

Here, we use GPS tracking to assess sex- and size-related variation in the spatial behaviour of adult Lesser Black-backed Gulls (<i>Larus fuscus</i>) throughout their annual cycle. We did not find sex- or size-dependent differences in wintering area or the timing of spring migration. Instead, sexual differences occurred prior to, and during, autumn migration, when females strongly focussed on agricultural areas. Females exhibited a more protracted autumn migration strategy, hence spent more time on stopover sites and arrived 15 days later at their wintering areas, than males. This shift in habitat use and protracted autumn migration coincided with the timing of moult, which overlaps with chick rearing and migration. Our results suggest that this overlap between energy-demanding activities may lead females to perform a more prolonged autumn migration, which results in spatiotemporal differences in foraging habitat use between the sexes.","Baert, J.M.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Heylen, B.C.; Kavelaars, M.M.; Buijs, R.-J.; Shamoun-Baranes, J.; Lens, L.; Müller, W.",WOS:000428618900034,"Buijs, Roland-Jan, R.-J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-018-23605-x,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,,LONG-DISTANCE MIGRATION; ANNUAL CYCLE; SATELLITE TRACKING; NONBREEDING SEASON; SPRING MIGRATION; BIRD MIGRATION; BODY-MASS; PERFORMANCE; FLIGHT; MORTALITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC) ,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Here, we sampled in a subtropical seagrass-seaweed mixed bed to elucidate the effect of the macrophyte phylogenetic diversity based on the taxonomic relatedness as well as the macrophyte species diversity on species diversity of mobile epi-benthic invertebrates. Using regression analyses for each macrophyte parameter as well as multiple regression analyses, we found that the macrophyte phylogenetic diversity (taxonomic diversity index: Delta) positively influenced the invertebrate species richness and diversity index (H′). Although the macrophyte species richness and H′ also positively influenced the invertebrate species richness, the best fit model for invertebrate species richness did not include them, suggesting that the macrophyte species diversity indirectly influenced invertebrate species diversity. Possible explanations of the effects of macrophyte Delta on the invertebrate species diversity were the niche complementarity effect and the selection effect.

Species diversity was estimated as species richness from samples comprising 20752 individuals representing 51 benthic invertebrate taxa. Genetic diversity was estimated for a single focal taxon, the polychaete <i>Pygospio elegans</i>, as mean allelic richness at 7 microsatellite loci. Combining all samples, a significant positive correlation between species richness and allelic richness was found. Median sediment grain size and mean temperature had significant effects on species richness, whereas only mean temperature had a significant effect on allelic richness of <i>P. elegans</i>. Our results show that both the benthic community as a whole and populations of <i>P. elegans</i> respond similarly to seasonal environmental variation at the study sites. The results suggest that seasonal timing of reproduction and dispersal in this temperate marine habitat might have a greater influence on diversity than spatially varying environmental variables and highlight the benefits of also investigating temporal SGDCs.

Our study is focused on a shallow coastal lagoon of Peloponnese, Gialova Lagoon, which for several years has attracted the scientific interest of archaeologists, geomorphologists as well as sedimentologists. Gialova lagoon is located near the ancient city of Pylos, the kingdom of king Nestor during the Mycenaean period (1600–1100 BC). The objectives of this study are: (a) to reconstruct the middle to late Holocene depositional environments of the lagoon and (b) to correlate our data to already existing publications, in order to shed new light on the Holocene evolution of the lagoon and the associated coastal palaeoenvironmental changes. An 8 m deep vibracore was drilled and a multi proxy analysis was carried out on the sediment sequence, including sedimentological (grain size analysis and moment measures, total organic carbon – TOC, total nitrogen – TN and total phosphorus – TP), high resolution geochemical (XRF-scanning) and palaeontological (micro- and macro faunal) analysis. The chronological framework is based on five <sup>14</sup>C datings forming the basis for an age depth model, calculated using the OxCal software. The radiocarbon dates from previous studies (6 cores, ∼20 dates) were also taken into account. The data synthesis and interpretation provided robust and coherent indications regarding the palaeoenvironment, shoreline changes and the rate of geomorphological changes of the coastal area of Gialova Lagoon, as well as useful information about the palaeonvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions that prevailed during the Mycenaean period. The interpretation, reveal a transition from a shallow marine environment (6500-5800 yr B.P.) to a brackish/lagoonal (5800-3300 yr B.P.), followed by a shift towards a freshwater/marsh environment (3300 yr B.P. to present).","Emmanouilidis, A.; Katrantsiotis, C.; Norström, E.; Risberg, J.; Kylander, M.; Sheik, T.A.; Iliopoulos, G.; Avramidis, P.",WOS:000432448600005,"Emmanouilidis, Alexandros, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.03.005,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Coastal geomorphology; Sedimentology; Geochemistry; XRF scanning; Palaeoecology; Pylos,Journal article,,,"Univ Patras, Dept Geol, Div Gen Marine Geol & Geodynam, Rion 26504, Greece.",Greece,Coastal geomorphology; Sedimentology; Geochemistry; XRF scanning; Palaeoecology; Pylos,RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; LAGUNA-POTROK-AIKE; LOS ESTADOS 54.4-DEGREES-S; LAST 2 MILLENNIA; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; BRONZE-AGE; GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SOUTHWESTERN PELOPONNESE; PLANKTIC FORAMINIFERA,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,University of Patras - Department of Geology,,Greece,,University,Science

Herbivory is a particularly interesting trophic niche because there are theorized trade-offs associated with diets comprised of low quality food that might prevent the evolution of herbivory in certain environments. Herbivory has also been identified as a potential evolutionary ""dead-end"" that hinders subsequent trophic diversification. For this study we investigated trophic niche evolution in Clupeoidei (anchovies, sardines, herrings, and their relatives) and tested the hypotheses that herbivory is negatively correlated with salinity and latitude using a novel, time-calibrated molecular phylogeny, trophic guilds delimited using diet data and cluster analysis, and standard and phylogenetically-informed statistical methods. We identified eight clupeoid trophic guilds: molluscivore, terrestrial invertivore, phytoplanktivore, macroalgivore, detritivore, piscivore, crustacivore, and zooplanktivore. Standard statistical methods found a significant negative correlation between latitude and the proportion of herbivorous clupeoids (herbivorous clupeoid species/total clupeoid species), but no significant difference in the proportion of herbivorous clupeoids between freshwater and marine environments. Phylogenetic least squares regression did not identify significant negative correlations between latitude and herbivory or salinity and herbivory. In clupeoids there were five evolutionary transitions from non-herbivore to herbivore guilds and no transitions from herbivore to non-herbivore guilds. There were no transitions to zooplanktivore, the most common guild, but it gave rise to all trophic guilds, except algivore, at least once. Transitions to herbivory comprised a significantly greater proportion of diet transitions in tropical and subtropical (<35°) relative to temperate areas (>35°). Our findings suggest cold temperatures may constrain the evolution of herbivory and that herbivory might act as an evolutionary ""dead-end"" that hinders subsequent trophic diversification, while zooplanktivory acts as an evolutionary ""cradle"" that facilitates trophic diversification.","Egan, J.P.; Bloom, D.; Kuo, C.-H.; Hammer, M.P.; Tongnunui, P.; Iglésias, S.P.; Sheaves, M.; Grudpan, C.; Simons, A.M.",WOS:000430138000014,"Egan, Joshua, J.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.03.011,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,Clupeoidei; Diet transition; Herbivory; Latitudinal gradient; Phylogenetics; Trophic niche,Journal article,,,"Univ Minnesota, Conservat Sci Grad Program, 135B Skok Hall,2003 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",USA,Trophic niche; Diet transition; Herbivory; Clupeoidei; Phylogenetics; Latitudinal gradient,GIZZARD SHAD; DOROSOMA-CEPEDIANUM; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; GUILD STRUCTURE; COASTAL WATERS; THREADFIN SHAD; R PACKAGE; MARINE; TELEOSTEI; DIVERSIFICATION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Minnesota,x,USA,,University,Science

Whilst whelk populations are known to be vulnerable to localised overexploitation due to inherent life-history parameters, fisheries remain relatively unrestricted by conservation measures in comparison to other fisheries operating in the area. With the exception of the northernmost fishing ground between the Isle of Man and Scotland (Point of Ayre), the size-at-maturity (L<sub>50</sub>) estimate for populations sampled during peak-aGSI (the months in which adjusted gonadosomatic index is highest) indicates that whelk are being fished before the time at first spawning throughout the study area. A correlation was detected between the size (total shell length) and depth, with smaller whelks found in deeper waters where there generally is greater fishing effort, although effort data is not available at a resolution to investigate this relationship quantitatively. No clear link between benthic infauna biomass and the average size (total shell length) or reproductive capacity (aGSI) of whelk sampled throughout ICES Area VIIa was found, indicating that the ecological energetics of whelk populations are more likely to be a function of scavenging opportunities than predation on benthic communities. A mixed cohort analysis utilized length-based data to infer a size-at-age relationship in the absence of direct age observations (<em>e.g.</em> statolith rings), with whelk recruiting into the Isle of Man fishery five years after hatching. The evidence presented in this study suggests that, prior to recommending a MLS that will adequately protect the spawning stock biomass, L<sub>50</sub> values should be adjusted for pre-spawning growth between the ideal time of assessment (when aGSI values are at a peak) and the spawning season (when aGSI values decrease).","Emmerson, J.A.; Haig, J.A.; Bloor, I.S.M.; Kaiser, M.J.",WOS:000432768000014,"Emmerson, J.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.015,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,"Gastropoda, ""Mollusca""",,,Commercial fishery; Size at maturity; Mollusc; Gastropod; Reproduction; Fisheries; Management; Gonadosomatic index,Journal article,,,"Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Sch Ocean Sci, Askew St, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales.",Wales,Commercial fishery; Size at maturity; Mollusc; Gastropod; Reproduction; Fisheries; Management; Gonadosomatic index,REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; SPATIAL VARIATION; IRISH SEA; SIZE; MATURITY; EXPLOITATION; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; JERSEY,Fisheries,Fisheries,Bangor University - School of Ocean Sciences,x,UK,,University,Science

PHYSTWO operates in the dimensionless plane composed by the first two EOF modes generated through the decomposition of a space–nLw matrix at seven wavelengths (412, 443, 469, 488, 531, 547, and 555 nm). PFT determination is performed using orthogonal models derived from the acceptable ranges of anomalies proposed by PHYSAT but adjusted with the available regional and global data. In applying PHYSTWO to study phytoplankton community structures in the coastal upwelling system off central Chile, we find that this method increases the accuracy of PFT identification, extends the application of this tool to waters with high Chl-a concentration, and significantly decreases (~60%) the undetermined retrievals when compared with PHYSAT. The improved accuracy of PHYSTWO and its applicability for the identification of new PFT are discussed.","Correa-Ramirez, M.; Morales, C.; Letelier, R.; Anabalón, V.; Hormazabal, S.",WOS:000435187500010,"Correa-Ramirez, Marco, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs10040498,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,, phytoplankton functional types (PFT); ocean color; modified PHYSAT method; empirical orthogonal functions (EOF); coastal upwelling waters,Journal article,,,"Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ciencias del Mar, Valparaiso 2340000, Chile.",Chile,phytoplankton functional types (PFT); ocean color; modified PHYSAT method; empirical orthogonal functions (EOF); coastal upwelling waters,OCEAN COLOR; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; CENTRAL CHILE; GLOBAL OCEAN; ATLANTIC; BIOMASS; SIZE; VARIABILITY; CONCEPCION,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,,Chile,,University,Science

Moreover, most studies addressing shrimp aquaculture focus either larval performance or juvenile grow-out, with the vast majority overlooking the potential existence of carry-over effects from one life stage to the next. Such effects in phenotypic traits may be expressed when species undergo dramatic shifts, such as at metamorphosis. The present study evaluated the existence of potential trade-offs between the timing of metamorphosis and the grow-out performance displayed by juvenile marine caridean shrimp using <i>Lysmata seticaudata</i>, a marine ornamental species, as model. Larvae that delayed metamorphosis for longer periods (termed as late settlers – LS) gave origin to significantly larger sized post-larvae (7.37 ± 0.25 mm total length), than that displayed by early or middle settlers (ES and MS, 6.95 ± 0.28 mm and 7.02 ± 0.24 mm, respectively). However, at the end of the grow-out period juvenile shrimp originating from LS postlarvae displayed a significantly smaller TL (10.38 ± 0.82 mm) than that displayed from conspecifics originating from ES and MS (11.20 ± 1.02 and 11.22 ± 0.62 mm, respectively). The larger size attained by L. seticaudata post-larvae originating from specimens that delayed metamorphosis (LS) is likely achieved by trading-off endogenous energetic reserves that, once allocated to delay the transition to benthic life will no longer be available to help fueling early juvenile growth. The present work suggests that a detailed record on the timing of metamorphosis can be a more reliable proxy to access the grow-out performance of juvenile marine caridean shrimp than postlarval size at metamorphosis. An optimal aquaculture of organisms with complex life-cycles, such as decapod crustaceans, relies on the detailed knowledge of each life stage performance, as the exposure to suboptimal conditions during early life stages may give origin to phenotypic traits that are carried-over and only displayed later in the life cycle (e.g. post-metamorphosis).","Carvalho, L.; Calado, R.",WOS:000432520900013,"Carvalho, Leina, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.04.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Lysmata seticaudata,,,Carry-over effects; Marine ornamentals; Metamorphosis delay; Phenotypic traits,Journal article,,,"Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",Portugal,Carry-over effects; Lysmata seticaudata; Marine ornamentals; Metamorphosis delay; Phenotypic traits,DECAPOD CRUSTACEAN LARVAE; LIFE-CYCLES; DELAYED METAMORPHOSIS; PALAEMONETES-VARIANS; LITOPENAEUS-VANNAMEI; LYSMATA-SETICAUDATA; ORNAMENTAL DECAPODS; PHENOTYPIC LINKS; REARING SYSTEM; SURVIVAL,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Aveiro - Department of Biology,,Portugal,,University,Science

University of Gothenburg, Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences: Gothenburg. ISBN 978-91-88509-18-5. 41 pp.","Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are leading to a gradual decrease in ocean pH and changes in seawater carbonate chemistry, a process known as ocean acidification (OA). Such changes in oceanic environmental conditions will have negative consequences for marine life and organisms producing calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) structures are amongst the most vulnerable due to the additional costs associated with calcification and maintenance of calcified structures under more acidic conditions. As calcifying animals of particular commercial and ecological relevance, bivalve molluscs have frequently been the object of OA research. In this thesis, responses to changes in seawater acidity in commercially important bivalve species were investigated with the aim of understanding their adaptation potential to OA. As the main focus was on blue mussels, the first part of the thesis provided an introduction to blue musselspecies complex in Europe which is characterized by the three species <i>Mytilus edulis, M. Galloprovincialis</i> and <i>M. trossulus</i>. An analysis of potential consequences of interspecies hybridization for the aquaculture industry, especially in the context of changing environmental conditions, was provided. Possible positive and negative effects of hybridization were identified, the complexity of the blue mussel-species complex was highlighted and the implications of hybridization for adaptation were discussed. In the following section of the thesis, responses of <i>Mytilus edulis</i> larvae from a Swedish west coast population to elevated seawater acidity were investigated. By exposing larvae to a wide range of seawater acidity, the physiological tolerance threshold for normal shell development was identified and corresponded to pHT (pH on the total scale) ~ 7.8 which approximates the lower extremes of the local pH range naturally experienced by the larvae. This suggests that these mussels are well adapted to their local environment characterized by considerable fluctuations in seawater pH. Additionally, this result allowed selecting an appropriate pH level (pHT ~ 7.5, beyond the present range of natural variability), representing a realistic OA scenario for the investigated population and driving enough biological response to further investigate adaptation potential. This was achieved by measuring genetic variance and heritability of larval fitness-related traits (i.e. size and malformation of shell) through a crossbreeding experimental design and quantitative genetic techniques. Results showed high trait heritability under elevated seawater acidity, an indication of the potential of adapting to OA. Finally, in order to understand what functions and genes may be targeted by natural selection in the context of OA, genes involved in the initial phases of shell formation in Pacific oyster (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) larvae were identified. With a genome available, the Pacific oyster was an ideal candidate for this task. The identified genes were attributed to four categories (metabolic genes, transmembrane proteins, shell matrix proteins and protease inhibitors) and are candidates for genes under selection in the context of an acidifying ocean. Altogether the results of this thesis contribute to a better understanding of bivalve adaptation potential to global changes and provide critical information for future work (e.g. investigation of allelespecific associated tolerance to changes in environmental parameters).","Ventura, A.",,"Ventura, Alexander, A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Crassostrea gigas, ""Mytilus edulis""",,,ocean acidification; CO2; adaptation; larvae ,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, assessing the vulnerability of endangered species to parasitic infections is important in developing appropriate conservation strategies. We conducted an intensive bibliographical search to synthesize the available information about the parasites of Neotropical primates. We analyzed the host and parasite taxonomic coverage of the available studies, examined the advantages and disadvantages of the diagnostic techniques employed, identified information gaps that need to be addressed, and recommend future directions in the parasitological research of Neotropical primates. Researchers have reported 276 parasite taxa, including endo- and ectoparasites, in 21 of the 22 genera of Neotropical primates. Of these, 42 parasite species have also been reported in humans, although this number may be inaccurate owing to misidentification. The parasites of 50% of Neotropical primate species are completely unknown, and 32% of the parasites recorded in these hosts have not been identified to the species level. Information regarding ectoparasites is particularly limited. We need to develop methods that enhance parasite diagnosis accuracy when using noninvasive samples, and the incorporation of molecular techniques in routine procedures should be a priority in parasitological studies of Neotropical primates. An integrative approach in which veterinarians, primatologists, and parasitologists collaborate in the identification and treatment of parasites of Neotropical primates is essential to achieve significant progress in this field.","Solórzano-García, B.; Pérez-Ponce de León, G.",WOS:000434792500001,"Solórzano-García, Brenda, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10764-018-0031-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Coverage; Literature search; Multidisciplinary approach; Neotropical primates;  Parasites,Journal article,,,"Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, AP 70-153, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",Mexico,Coverage; Literature search; Multidisciplinary approach; Neotropical primates; Parasites,ALOUATTA-PALLIATA-AEQUATORIALIS; RANGING HOWLER MONKEYS; HELMINTH-PARASITES; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES; OESOPHAGOSTOMUM-BIFURCUM; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; PINWORM PARASITES; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; INFECTION,Zoology,Zoology,National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) - Department of Zoology - Institute of Biology,x,Mexico,,Research institute,Science

In light of this paradox we used a metacommunity framework to study spatial turnover in free-living nematode distribution and assess the importance of local environmental conditions in explaining differences between communities in surface and subsurface sediments of the Southern Ocean continental shelf. We analysed nematode community structure in two sediment layers (0–3 cm and 3–5 cm) of locations maximum 2400 km apart. We first focused on a subset of locations to evaluate whether the genus level is sufficiently taxonomically fine-grained to study large-scale patterns in nematode community structure. We subsequently used redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to quantify the unique and combined effects of local environmental conditions and spatial descriptors on genus-level community composition. Macroecological patterns in community structure were highly congruent at the genus and species level. Nematode community composition was highly divergent between both depth strata, likely as a result of local abiotic conditions. Variation in community structure between the different regions largely stemmed from turnover (i.e. genus/species replacement) rather than nestedness (i.e. genus/species loss). The level of turnover among communities increased with geographic distance and was more pronounced in subsurface layers compared to surface sediments. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that both environmental and spatial predictors significantly explained variation in community structure. Moreover, the shared fraction of both sets of variables was high, which suggested a substantial amount of spatially structured environmental variation. Additionally, the effect of space independent of environment was much higher than the effect of environment independent of space, which shows the importance of including spatial descriptors in meiofauna and nematode community ecology. Large-scale assessment of free-living nematode diversity and abundance in the Southern Ocean shelf zone revealed strong horizontal and vertical spatial structuring in response to local environmental conditions, in combination with (most likely) dispersal limitation.","Hauquier, F.; Verleyen, E.; Tytgat, B.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000441489600001,"Tytgat, Bjorn, B.","Protistology and Aquatic Ecology, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.04.005,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Antarctica;  Free-living marine nematoda;  Community ecology;  Continental shelf;  Dispersal;  Environmental filtering;  Variation partitioning,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Sterrecampus Bldg S8,Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Antarctica; Free-living marine nematoda; Community ecology; Continental shelf; Dispersal; Environmental filtering; Variation partitioning,DEEP-SEA BIODIVERSITY; SPATIAL PROCESSES; DISPERSAL LIMITATION; BETA DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; MEIOFAUNA; TURNOVER; PATTERNS; NICHE; METACOMMUNITIES,Oceanography,Oceanography,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Protistology & Aquatic Ecology (PAE),x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

We constructed a time‐calibrated, 11‐gene, 1151‐taxon phylogeny of diatoms – the most inclusive diatom species tree to date. We used this phylogeny, together with a comprehensive inventory of first–last occurrences of Cenozoic fossil diatoms, to estimate ranges of expected species richness, diversification and its variation through time and across lineages.  Diversification rates varied with life history traits. Although anisogamous lineages diversified faster than oogamous ones, this increase was restricted to a nested clade with active motility in the vegetative cells.  We propose that the evolution of motility in vegetative cells, following an earlier transition from oogamy to anisogamy, facilitated outcrossing and improved utilization of habitat complexity, ultimately leading to enhanced opportunity for adaptive divergence across a variety of novel habitats.

Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood, and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a phylogenomic dataset including all major tunicate lineages, consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species. Results: Phylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: (1) Appendicularia, (2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, (3) Molgulidae, and (4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification (~ 450–350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow one to compare their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages. Conclusions: Our study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for the main tunicate lineages.

The mitogenome is 14,268 bp in length and contains 34 genes: 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA, 19 tRNA and a control region. Three tRNA genes (trnE, trnI and trnS1) are missing. Most of the tRNA genes show secondary structures which derive from the usual cloverleaf pattern except for trnC which is characterised by the loss of the DHU-arm. Compared to the isopod ground pattern and Eurydice pulchra Leach, 1815 (suborder Cymothoida Wägele, 1989), the genome of G. ovalis shows few differences, with changes only around the control region. However, the genome of G. ovalis is very different from that of non-cymothoidan isopods and reveals that the gene order evolution in isopods is less conservative compared to other crustaceans. Phylogenic trees were constructed using maxiumum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses based on 13 protein-coding genes. The results do not support the placement of G. ovalis with E. pulchra and Bathynomus sp. in the same suborder; rather, G. ovalis appears to have a closer relationship to Ligia oceanica (Linnaeus, 1767), but this result suggests a need for more data and further analysis. Nevertheless, these results cast doubt that Epicaridea Latreille, 1825 can be placed as an infraorder within the suborder Cymothoida, and Epicaridea appears to also deserve subordinal rank.

The ascidian family of Styelidae encompasses strictly sexually reproducing solitary forms as well as colonial species that combine sexual reproduction with different forms of NED. To date, the phylogenetic relationships between colonial and solitary styelids remain controversial and so is the pattern of NED evolution. In this study, we built an original pipeline to combine 8 genomes with 18 de novo assembled transcriptomes and constructed datasets of unambiguously orthologous genes. Using a phylogenomic super-matrix of 4,908 genes from these 26 tunicates we provided a robust phylogeny of this family of chordates, which supports two convergent acquisitions of NED.

While the pipeline and the datasets produced can be used for further phylogenetic reconstructions in tunicates, the phylogeny provided here sets an evolutionary framework for future experimental studies on the emergence and disappearance of complex characters such as asexual propagation and whole body regeneration.","Alié, A.; Hiebert, L.S.; Simion, P.; Scelzo, M.; Prünster, M.M.; Lotito, S.; Delsuc, F.; Douzery, E.J.P.; Dantec, C.; Lemaire, P.; Darras, S.; Kawamura, K.; Brown, F.D.; Tiozzo, S.",WOS:000441141400014,"Douzery, Emmanuel, E.J.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/molbev/msy068,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Polyandrocarpa, ""Tunicata""",Regeneration,,"asexual reproduction, Botryllinae, cross-contamination, tunicate",Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Lab Biol Dev Villefranche Sur Mer LBDV, F-06230 Paris, France.",France,asexual reproduction; Botryllinae; cross-contamination; Polyandrocarpa; regeneration; tunicate,STEM-CELLS; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; REGENERATION; EXPRESSION; COLONIALITY; TUNICATES; EVOLUTION; INSIGHTS; CHORDATE; CONTAMINATION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Sorbonne University - Villefranche-sur-Mer Developmental Biology Laboratory,x,France,,Research institute,Science

It is widely spread in aquaculture facilities and leads to economic losses every year. As it has developed resistances against many common treatments, new control methods must be established. Here we characterize a novel gene family of the salmon louse, consisting of two genes, which has not been described in other species before. We analyzed temporal expression patterns of both genes, the localization of mRNA and protein. An RNAi mediated gene knockdown lead to information about the function of the protein. Overall, these two genes are expressed only in sperm ducts of male sea lice. The mucin‐like proteins can additionally be found in the wall of spermatophores, which are responsible for sperm transfer to females. Knockdown showed that both genes are essential for successful fertilization of females. Overall, all results indicate that the two analyzed genes are necessary for reproduction in sea lice as they are essential for the formation of a wall surrounding the spermatophores, which is needed for fertilization. Therefore, we name them Mucin‐like spermatophore wall protein 1 & 2 (MLSWP1 & MLSWP2). Analysis of sequence data from other copepod species suggests that MLSWPs are present in many copepod species and may also play a similar role in reproduction in those species.

Here, we applied a range of ecological criteria to assess areas of biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle region, a priority region for marine biodiversity conservation because of its high species richness and endemicity. We used distribution data of three biogenic habitats to assess the criterion of sensitive habitat, modeled geographic distributions of 10,672 species ranges and occurrence records of 19,251 species to evaluate the criterion of species richness, distributions of 834 species of special conservation concern to examine the criterion of species of conservation concern, distributions of 373 reef fish species to assess the criterion of restricted-range species, and distribution of nesting sites and migratory route of six species of sea turtle to evaluate the criterion of areas of importance for particular life history stages. We identified areas of biodiversity importance by superimposing each of the different criterion. We performed two tiers of multi-criteria analysis: (1) a Coral Triangle regional level analysis to identify “clustered hotspots” (i.e., groups of cells) of biodiversity significance, and (2) a site-based analysis to identify the specific sites (cells) of greatest biodiversity importance. We found that approximately 13% of the Coral Triangle was clustered into hotspots of high biodiversity importance. These areas occurred along the southern part of the Philippines, the north-eastern part of Malaysian Sabah, central to eastern reaches of Indonesia, the eastern part of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By comparison, the site-based analysis identified seven sites of highest biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle include: (1) the northern tip of Sulawesi Island, (2) Ambon Island, (3) Kei Islands, (4) Raja Ampat Archipelago of Indonesian Papua, (5) the Verde Island Passage, (6) the southern part of Negros Island, and (7) Cebu Island.

We amplified and sequenced related retrotransposons from the genomic DNA of many other bivalve species, finding evidence of horizontal transfer of retrotransposons from the genome of one species to another. First, the phylogenetic tree of the Steamer-like elements from 19 bivalve species is markedly discordant with host phylogeny, suggesting frequent cross-species transfer throughout bivalve evolution. Second, sequences nearly identical to Steamer were identified in the genomes of Atlantic razor clams and Baltic clams, indicating recent transfer. Finally, a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence database revealed that Steamer-like elements are present in the genomes of completely unrelated organisms, including zebrafish, sea urchin, acorn worms, and coral. Phylogenetic incongruity, a patchy distribution, and a higher similarity than would be expected by vertical inheritance all provide evidence for multiple long-distance cross-phyla horizontal transfer events. These data suggest that over both short- and long-term evolutionary timescales, Steamer-like retrotransposons, much like retroviruses, can move between organisms and integrate new copies into new host genomes.","Metzger, M.J.; Paynter, A.N.; Siddall, M.E.; Goff, S.P.",WOS:000431119600013,"Metzger, Michael, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.1717227115,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,Retrotransposons; transposable elements; horizontal transfer; bivalves; cross-phyla horizontal transfer,Journal article,,,"Columbia Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",USA,retrotransposons; transposable elements; horizontal transfer; bivalves; cross-phyla horizontal transfer,REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE ACTIVITY; CLAMS MYA-ARENARIA; SOFT-SHELL CLAMS; ROOTED PHYLOGENETIC TREES; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; TRANSMISSIBLE CANCER; NEOPLASTIC HEMOCYTES; HEMIC NEOPLASIA; EVOLUTION; WIDESPREAD,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Colombia University - Department of Microbiology and Immunology,,USA,,University,Science

We found that the developmental trajectories of the nestlings were not affected, and there were no differences in skeletal size and body mass at the fledging stage. A lack of negative effects on offspring development strongly suggests that the parental behaviour, and thus likely the foraging behaviour, did not differ between tagged and non-tagged individuals.

However, their taxonomy and phylogeny remain unclear from genus to family level due to equivocal morphological and anatomical characters among some taxa. In this study, we inferred the deep phylogenetic relationships among 42 mytiloid species, 19 genera, and five subfamilies of the extant marine mussels by using two mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and three nuclear (18S and 28S rRNA, and histone H3) genes. Phylogeny was reconstructed with a combination of five genes using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood method, and divergence time was estimated for the major nodes using a relaxed clock model with three fossil calibrations. Phylogenetic trees revealed two major clades (Clades 1 and 2). In Clade 1, the deep-sea mussels (subfamily Bathymodiolinae) were sister to subfamily Modiolinae (represented by <i>Modiolus</i>), and then was clustered with <i>Leiosolenus</i> (subfamily Lithophaginae). Clade 2 comprised <i>Lithophaga</i> (Lithophaginae) and subfamily Mytilinae. Additionally, a <i>Modiolus</i> species and <i>Musculus senhousia</i> (subfamily Crenellinae) were positioned within the subfamily Mytilinae.

Here, we present data on sub-lethal effects of temperature (using molecular biomarkers), thermal tolerance, warming safety margins and body size shifts of a gastropod (<i>Stramonita haemastoma</i>) from tropical rocky shores, under an experimental setup of a climate warming scenario. Heat shock response, protein damage, antioxidant activity and lipid damage were all evaluated once a week during one month of exposure at a control temperature, and at an experimental temperature of plus 3 °C. Significant increase of heat shock protein response, lipid peroxides and catalase at the elevated temperature suggest the activation of cytoprotective pathways as response to an increased thermal load. Duration of exposure also had a significant influence in the animals’ responses, since whole body thermal tolerance only showed acclimation potential in the short-term, but not in the long-term. Thermal safety margin was low for this species, suggesting a narrow ability to tolerate further warming. Smaller body sizes were observed in specimens exposed to increased temperature, suggesting the occurrence of slower growth and possible changes in energy metabolism. Hence, enduring thermal stress, as predicted if present day warming trends are not reversed, may compromise populations of tropical marine snails.","Madeira, C.; Mendonça, V.; Flores, A.A.V.; Diniz, M.S.; Vinagre, C.",WOS:000444520600062,"Diniz, Mário, M.S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.04.044,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Gastropoda,,,Tropical gastropod; Ocean warming; Cellular stress response; Thermal tolerance; Rocky shore; Eco-physiology,Journal article,,,"Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",Portugal,Tropical gastropod; Ocean warming; Cellular stress response; Thermal tolerance; Rocky shore; Eco-physiology,HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; ECOLOGICAL RELEVANCE; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; STRESS RESPONSES; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ENERGY RESERVES; ANTARCTIC FISH; METABOLIC-RATE,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Lisbon,,Portugal,,University,Science

Spatial variations of CH<sub>4</sub> were related to sediment organic matter (OM) content and gassy sediments. In nearshore stations with fine sand or muddy sediments, the CH<sub>4</sub> seasonal cycle followed water temperature, suggesting methanogenesis control by temperature in these OM-rich sediments. In offshore stations with permeable sediments, the CH<sub>4</sub> seasonal cycle showed a yearly peak following the chlorophyll-<i>a</i> spring peak, suggesting that in these OM-poor sediments, methanogenesis depended on freshly produced OM delivery. This does not exclude the possibility that some CH<sub>4</sub> might originate from dimethylsulfide (DMS) or dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) or methylphosphonate transformations in the most offshore stations. Yet, the average seasonal CH<sub>4</sub> cycle was unrelated to those of DMS(P), very abundant during the <i>Phaeocystis</i> bloom.

The strong control of CH<sub>4</sub> by sediment OM content and by temperature suggests that marine coastal CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, in particular in shallow areas, should respond to future eutrophication and warming of climate.

Mine tailing particles are sharper than natural occurring sediments and could therefore cause more harmful effects. Cold-water coral ecosystems are among the habitats in danger of being affected by dumping of mine tailings. Cold-water corals have very slow growth rates but the habitats they provide support high levels of species richness and functional diversity. Two soft corals, cauliflower coral (<i>Duva florida</i>) and red tree coral (<i>Primnoa resedaeformis</i>), were chosen as model organisms to study the effects of excessive mine tailing sedimentation and the effect of particle shape in a three-month long experiment. The corals were exposed to a concentration of 8 mg<sup>−1</sup> of two types of sediment, rough edged mine tailings (MT) and smooth edged spherical glass beads (GB). Glass beads were mimicking natural, smooth sediment, and both sediment types had a particle size distribution of 0–63 μm. Sedimentation effects were investigated using <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C isotope ratio to assess food intake, time-lapse images to determine the effects on tissue and behavior, and histological samples to identify and quantify particles inside the polyps. When exposed to MT, food intake decreased significantly in <i>D. florida</i> and increased significantly in <i>P. resedaeformis</i>. <i>Duva florida</i> exhibited a behavioral response under MT treatment, being contracted for prolonged periods. <i>Primnoa resedaeformis</i> lost a significant proportion of polyps under both treatments. Histology showed mine tailing particles of sizes 10 μm embedded in the tissue of both species. The results suggest that sharp particles are more harmful than smooth edged particles to both species, in the size range studied.

Due to changing environmental conditions, in the last decades many subtropical/tropical taxa have reached the coasts of the Canary Islands. Comparing the carcinofaunal composition and their biogeographic components between the Canary and Cape Verde archipelagos would aid in: validating the appropriateness in separating both archipelagos into different ecoregions (Spalding et al. 2007), and understanding faunal movements between areas of benthic habitat. The consistency of both ecoregions is here compared and validated by assembling their decapod crustacean checklists, analysing their taxa composition, gathering their bathymetric data, and comparing their biogeographic patterns. Four main evidences (i.e. different taxa; divergent taxa composition; different composition of biogeographic patterns; different endemicity rates) support that separation, especially in coastal benthic decapods; and these parametres combined would be used as a valuable tool at comparing biotas from oceanic archipelagos. To understand/predict south-north faunal movements in a scenario of regional tropicalization, special attention is paid to species having at the Canaries their southernmost occurrence, and also to tropical African warm-affinity species.","González, J.A.",WOS:000430687800001,"González, José Antonio, J.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zootaxa.4413.3.1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Crustacea, ""Decapoda""","Benthic environment, ""Catalogues""",,biogeographic patterns; decapod crustaceans; Eastern Atlantic; marine ecoregions,Journal article,,,"Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, I UNAT, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",Spain,Benthic environment; biogeographic patterns; catalogues; decapod crustaceans; Eastern Atlantic; marine ecoregions,1ST RECORD; ANNOTATED CHECKLIST; FAMILIES CHIROSTYLIDAE; ATLANTIC DECAPODA; COASTAL FISHES; SP-NOV; ANOMURA; BRACHYURA; CRABS; PARAPAGURIDAE,Zoology,Zoology,University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria - I UNAT,x,Spain,,University,Science

Yet given the complexity of polar marine ecosystems, predicting the mode, direction and extent of these consequences remains challenging. Trait-based approaches are increasingly adopted as a tool by which to explore changes in functioning, but trait information is largely absent for the high latitudes. Some understanding of trait–function relationships can be gathered from studies at lower latitudes, but given the uniqueness of polar ecosystems it is questionable whether these relationships can be directly transferred. Here we discuss the challenges of using trait-based approaches in polar regions and present a roadmap of how to overcome them by following six interlinked steps: (1) forming an active, international research network, (2) standardizing terminology and methodology, (3) building and crosslinking trait databases, (4) conducting coordinated trait-function experiments, (5) implementing traits into models, and finally, (6) providing advice to management and stakeholders. The application of trait-based approaches in addition to traditional species-based methods will enable us to assess the effects of rapid ongoing changes on the functioning of marine polar ecosystems. Implementing our roadmap will make these approaches more easily accessible to a broad community of users and consequently aid understanding of the future polar oceans.","Degen, R.; Aune, M.; Bluhm, B.A.; Cassidy, C.; Kedra, M.; Kraan, C.; Vandepitte, L.; Wlodarska-Kowalczuk, M.; Zhulay, I.; Albano, P.G.; Bremner, J.; Grebmeier, J.M.; Link, H.; Morata, N.; Nordström, M.C.; Shojaei, M.G.; Sutton, L.; Zuschin, M.",WOS:000444520600071,"Albano, Paolo, P.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.04.050,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Functional traits;  Marine;  Polar regions;  Climate change;  Ecosystem functioning;  Trait database,Journal article,,,"Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Riooceanog, Vienna, Austria.",Austria,Functional traits; Marine; Polar regions; Climate change; Ecosystem functioning; Trait database,MACOMA-BALTHICA COMMUNITY; FUNCTIONAL-GROUP APPROACH; SPECIES TRAITS; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; LIFE-HISTORY; BARENTS SEA; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BENTHIC FAUNA; ECOLOGICAL TRAITS,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Vienna - Department of Limnology and Biooceanography,x,,,,

LocationThe shallow seas.MethodsWe applied a typical species distribution model (SDM), maximum entropy, to examine the utility of (1) two versions of habitat variables (habitat occurrences vs. proximity to habitats) and (2) three sources of species data: quality research‐grade (RG) data, quality‐unknown citizen science (CS) and museum‐collection (MC) data. We used the best combinations of species data and habitat variables to predict distributions and estimate species–habitat relations and threatened status for seahorse species. ResultsWe demonstrated that using “proximity to habitats” and integrating all species datasets (RG, CS and MC) derived models with the highest accuracies among all dataset variations. Based on this finding, we derived reliable models for 33 species. Our models suggested that only 0.4% of potential seahorse range was suitable to more than three species together; seahorse biogeographic epicentres were mainly in the Philippines; and proximity to sponges was an important habitat variable. We found that 12 “Data Deficient” species might be threatened based on our predictions according to IUCN criteria. Main conclusionsWe highlight that using proper habitat variables (e.g., proximity to habitats) is critical to determine distributions and key habitats for low‐mobility animals; collating and integrating quality‐unknown occurrences (e.g., CS and MC) with quality research data are meaningful for building SDMs for rare species. We encourage the application of SDMs to estimate area of occupancy for rare organisms to facilitate their conservation status assessment.","Zhang, X.; Vincent, A.C.J.",WOS:000435934800012,"Zhang, Xiong, X.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12741,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""EUROBIS ackn - indirect use"", ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Hippocampus,"Data quality, ""Rare species""",Species Distribution Model,citizen science; Maxent; museum collections; seahorse; species distribution model,Journal article,,,"Univ British Columbia, Project Seahorse, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",Canada,citizen science; data quality; Maxent; museum collections; rare species; seahorse; species distribution model,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SPATIAL SEGREGATION; BIODIVERSITY; SYNGNATHIDAE; DISPERSAL; NICHE; EXTINCTION; GUTTULATUS; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of British Columbia - Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries - Seahorse,x,Canada,,Research institute,Science

Top predators, such as penguins, are known to feed regularly on coastal juvenile/sub-adult cephalopods. Using eastern rockhopper penguins <i>Eudyptes filholi</i> as coastal biological samplers, we examined in detail the cephalopod component of their diet in Campbell Island (New Zealand) during two consecutive breeding seasons in order to evaluate (1) the relative importance of cephalopods (by frequency of occurrence, by number and by mass) to the diet of both adult and chick penguins, (2) the habitat and trophic levels of the cephalopods in the region and (3) the status of the juvenile/sub-adult cephalopod community in the waters around Campbell Island. Our results show that eastern rockhopper penguins feed on eight species of juvenile and sub-adult cephalopods, with <i>Onykia ingens</i>, <i>Martialia hyadesi</i> and <i>Octopus campbelli</i> being the most important species by frequency of occurrence, number and mass. Differences between the diets of adult and chick penguins and between breeding seasons were found.

Anticipating change in ecosystem services is a pressing challenge that requires understanding how species respond to an environmental change, and how they contribute to ecosystem services. Building on analogous efforts by plant ecologists, we propose a trait‐based framework that aims to predict the resistance and recovery of coral ecosystem services against both pulse and press disturbances. The framework involves identifying effect, resistance, and recovery traits across coral species and using these to ascertain how species might (1) contribute to a service, (2) resist disturbance, and (3) recover after the disturbance. By identifying trait functional overlaps and quantifying correlations among the trait types, the framework can yield a better understanding of the potential mechanistic links between community assembly, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem functioning. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a virtual scenario, implemented via simulation, in which habitat provisioning is the focal ecosystem service, and cyclones and bleaching events are the disturbances of interest. This demonstration required us to assemble an extensive dataset of relevant traits—a process that revealed key gaps in the coral trait database and in our understanding of coral functional ecology. The framework can provide predictive power for the resilience of ecosystem services and can also help identify crucial knowledge gaps, research objectives, and strategies for applying a trait‐based approach to advancing coral reef science and conservation.","Carturan, B.S.; Parrott, L.; Pither, J.",WOS:000435640100012,"Pither, Jason, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ecs2.2214,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"coral community; ecosystem service; effect, resistance and recovery framework; functional traits; resilience; trait correlations; trait functional overlap",Journal article,,,"Univ British Columbia, Inst Biodivers Resilience & Ecosyst Serv, Okanagan Campus,1177 Res Rd, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",Canada,coral community; ecosystem service; effect; resistance and recovery framework; functional traits; resilience; trait correlations; trait functional overlap,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; LONG-TERM; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MORTALITY; SUSCEPTIBILITY,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of British Columbia - Department of Biology,x,Canada,,University,Science

Arguably one of the most mobile or dynamic marine ecosystems is a sea turtle carapace, hosting tens to hundreds or even thousands of epibiotic organisms; and as the turtle breeds, feeds and migrates, provides an ecosystem that is continuously exposed to changes and potential colonizers. In this study we investigated the nematode communities associated with 19 Hawksbill sea turtle carapaces (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>), and compared nematode structural (composition, richness and diversity) and functional (trophic types and gender/life stages) community parameters with those of other comparable epibiotic substrates (macrophytes, natural and artificial hard substrates) to see whether turtle carapaces are hotspots of nematode diversity and function among substrates suitable for epifauna. We also addressed potential epibiotic macrofauna-nematode interactions by looking at the relationships between macrofauna richness and nematode richness, diversity and community composition. Results suggest that the macrofauna play a bioconstructing role, creating several microenvironments, and thereby enhancing the richness and diversity of the associated nematode assemblages. This was supported by a direct and positive relationship between macrofauna and nematode richness, and implies a genera enrichment process across size classes and phyla. All heterotrophic nematode feeding guilds were recovered from the carapaces, with dominance of predators/omnivores and epistrate feeders. Nematode juveniles dominated in terms of abundance, and a female/male ratio of 1.11 was observed. Nematode richness and diversity were higher than found on other substrates, but feeding guild, gender and life stage structure did not differ compared to nematode communities from all other epibiotic substrates. As a result, we argue that turtle carapaces can be seen as hotspots for nematode biodiversity compared to other epibiotic substrates, but this is not reflected in the function of the nematode community. This study is the first to investigate in detail sea turtle carapace nematode communities, their richness, diversity, trophic and life cycle structure, and potential interactions with their co-epibionts, the macrofauna.","dos Santos, G.A.P.; Corrêa, G.V.V.; Valdes, Y.; de Oliveira, D.A.S.; Fonŝeca-Genevois, V.G.; Silva, A.C.; Pontes, L.P.; Dolan, E.; Ingels, J.",WOS:000430034100015,"Silva, A.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.08.009,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Eretmochelys imbricata, ""Nematoda""",,,Nematode; Macrofauna; Hawksbill sea turtle; Ecological interactions andecosystem engineers,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Av Prof Moraes Rego S-N,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, Pe, Brazil.",Brazil,Nematode; Macrofauna; Hawksbill sea turtle; Ecological interactions and ecosystem engineers,LOGGERHEAD SEA-TURTLES; EAST PACIFIC RISE; LIVING AQUATIC NEMATODES; MARINE NEMATODES; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; CARAPACE EPIBIONTS; FOOD AVAILABILITY; CARETTA-CARETTA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MEIOFAUNA,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) - Department of Zoology,x,Brazil,,University,Science

The geological setting and the fluid geochemical characteristics of the ATI mud volcanoes are different from those located within the AWGC. The main aim of this study is to describe and compare the spatial and vertical distributions of the meiofauna and nematode assemblages from the ATI mud volcanoes, the Porto mud volcano located in the AWGC, and a non-seep site (Site 2) as reference. The pore-water on the uppermost sediment layers has compositions close to the near-bottom seawater. The meiofauna abundances were generally lower and the vertical distribution of the assemblages showed a typical pattern, gradually decreasing towards depth. The lack of spatial patterns of the standing stocks contrasts with the spatial variability of diversity and biomass, related to the differences in the nematode assemblages that are distinct between ATI, Site 2 and the Porto mud volcano. The ATI and Site 2 assemblages are similar to deep-sea non-seep habitats, and are clearly coupled with the environmental conditions of the bottom seawater.

For terrestrial environments, WorldClim has served this purpose since 2005, but equivalent marine data only became available in 2012, with pioneer initiatives like Bio-ORACLE providing data layers for several ecologically relevant variables. Currently, the available marine data packages have not yet been updated to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions nor to present times, and are mostly restricted to the top surface layer of the oceans, precluding the modelling of a large fraction of the benthic diversity that inhabits deeper habitats. To address this gap, we present a significant update of Bio-ORACLE for new future climate scenarios, present-day conditions and benthic layers (near sea bottom). The reliability of data layers was assessed using a cross-validation framework against in situ quality-controlled data. This test showed a generally good agreement between our data layers and the global climatic patterns. We also provide a package of functions in the R software environment (sdmpredictors) to facilitate listing, extraction and management of data layers and allow easy integration with the available pipelines for bioclimatic modelling.

This interdisciplinary article, written from the points of view of environmental science and cultural studies, proposes humans as simply another species when entering the ocean, presenting a decolonising shift in paradigm that supports an interspecies ethics of engagement in understanding shark-human interactions. The shifting environmental, political, social and cultural realities of shark-human interactions are examined from the point of view of an endangered species that is hunted by humans in the pursuit of making beaches ‘safe’ for human leisure activities. The human ‘right to leisure’ enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) raises philosophical and ethical implications in respect of human rights taking precedence over a species’ right to live in its environment. The article builds upon philosophical debates in environmental ethics, offering a point of cultural recognition of the profound imbalance that is being imposed upon Nature.

Differentially expressed genes (between control and damaged animals) were functionally enriched with processes relating to cellular stress, the immune response and biomineralisation. Comparative transcriptomics highlighted genes, and more broadly molecular mechanisms, that are likely to be pivotal in this lack of acclimation.

We performed a structural and crystallographic study of both materials, paying attention to the transitions between them. The morphology and crystallography of the laths comprising both microstructures are similar. The main differences were, in general, crystallographic orientation and texture. Whereas the foliated microstructure has a moderate sheet texture, with a defined 001 maximum, the chalk has a much weaker sheet texture, with a defined 011 maximum. This is striking because of the much more disorganized aspect of the chalk. We hypothesize that part of the unanticipated order is inherited from the foliated microstructure by means of, possibly,  {0118} twinning. Growth line distribution suggests that during chalk formation, the mantle separates from the previous shell several times faster than for the foliated material. A shortage of structural material causes the chalk to become highly porous and allows crystals to reorient at a high angle to the mantle surface, with which they continue to keep contact. In conclusion, both materials are structurally similar and the differences in orientation and aspect simply result from differences in growth conditions.","Checa, A.G.; Harper, E.M.; González-Segura, A.",WOS:000431955100012,"Harper, Elizabeth, E.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-018-25923-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Granada, Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra, CSIC, Armilla 18100, Spain.",Spain,,CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS; CALCITE; BIVALVES; CALCIFICATION; LAYERS; FORM,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Granada,,Spain,,University,Science

This chapter outlines those industries’ paths for marketing marine natural products (MNPs), from discovery and development up to final product marketing. Focus is given on compounds that successfully reached the market and, particularly, the approaches employed by the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical companies that succeeded in marketing those products. Some key failures in each market segment are analysed, allowing lessons to be learned and key hurdles to be avoided in MNP development. The main challenges faced during MNP programs are assessed and mapped in the market funnel of common product development routes.

Because the use of shipping canals by, and their effects on, migrating fish remain unknown, we assessed whether these canals can play a significant role in the migration of the critically endangered European eel. Only one third of 70 acoustically tagged silver eels completed migration through a shipping canal, and did so at a very low pace (average <0.06 m s<sup>-1</sup>) due to delays at shipping locks and most likely also due to the disruption of water flow. These delays may come at an energetic cost, hampering the chances of successful migration. Knowledge on the impact of shipping canals on diadromous fish is crucial for proper management regulations. For instance, the observation that eels mostly migrated at night and during spring and autumn can support water managers to define adequate measures to improve eel migration in shipping canals.","Verhelst, P.; Baeyens, R.; Reubens, J.; Benitez, J.-P.; Coeck, J.; Goethals, P.L.M.; Ovidio, M.; Vergeynst, J.; Moens, T.; Mouton, A.M.",WOS:000438005100017,"Benitez, Jean-Phillippe, J.-P.","Laboratory of Fish Demography and Hydroecology, UR FOCUS, University of Liège",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.05.013,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Diadromous; Canal; Migration; Water regulation; Shipping locks,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Diadromous; Canal; Migration; Water regulation; Shipping locks,DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; FRESH-WATER; SPAWNING MIGRATION; RIVER MEUSE; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; SEA; CONSERVATION; HYDROPOWER; ESCAPEMENT,Fisheries,Fisheries,University of Liège - Faculty of Sciences - Department of Sciences and Management of the Environment - Laboratory of Fish Demography and Hydroecology,x,Belgium,,University,Science

Changes in this community may impact a wide range of species (Capuzzo et al. 2018) ranging from zooplankton and fish to seabirds and marine mammals. Efficient monitoring of the phytoplankton community is therefore essential (Edwards et al. 2002). Traditional monitoring techniques are highly time intensive and involve taxonomists identifying and counting numerous specimens under the light microscope. With the recent development of automated sampling devices, image analysis technologies and learning algorithms, the rate of counting and identification of phytoplankton can be increased significantly (Thyssen et al. 2015). The FlowCAM (Álvarez et al. 2013) is an imaging particle analysis system for the identification and classification of phytoplankton. Within the Belgian Lifewatch observatory, monthly phytoplankton samples are taken at nine stations in the Belgian part of the North Sea. These samples are run through the FlowCAM and each particle is photographed. Next, the particles are identified based on their morphology (and fluorescence) using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision. This procedure requires learning sets of expert validated images. The CNNs are specifically designed to take advantage of the two dimensional structure of these images by finding local patterns, being easier to train and having many fewer parameters than a fully connected network with the same number of hidden units.In this work we present our approach to the use of CNNs for the identification and classification of phytoplankton, testing it on several benchmarks and comparing with previous classification techniques. The network architecture used is ResNet50 (He et al. 2016). The framework is fully written in Python using the TensorFlow (Abadi, M. et al. 2016) module for Deep Learning.Deployment and exploitation of the current framework is supported by the recently started European Union Horizon 2020 programme funded project DEEP-Hybrid-Datacloud (Grant Agreement number 777435), which supports the expensive training of the system needed to develop the application and provides the necessary computational resources to the users.","Lloret, L.; Heredia, I.; Aguilar, F.; Debusschere, E.; Deneudt, K.; Hernandez, F.",,"Deneudt, Klaas, K.",Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.2.25762,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,deep learning; phytoplankton; Convolutional Neural Networks; identification; machine learning; classification,Journal article,,,,,,,,,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Optimized plankton imaging, clustering and visualization workflows through integrative data management and application of artificial intelligence. <i>Geophys. Res. Abstr. 20(EGU2018-14458)</i>","Phytoplankton is a diverse group of photosynthesizing organisms which account for approximately fifty percent of the primary production on Earth. Increasing our knowledge on phytoplankton dynamics (and plankton in general) is therefore of major importance. In the present research, we aimed to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phyto- and zooplankton community in the Eastern English Channel, Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Thames estuary. To do so, we organized a JERICO-NEXT Lifewatch cruise in May 2017 on board of the RV Simon Stevin and sampled 44 stations, involving five research institutions from France (CNRS-LOG,), The Netherlands (RWS, NIOZ) and Belgium (UGENT, VLIZ). To quantify the biomass of the phytoplankton community we used a unique combination of three flow cytometers and two Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometerss that were coupled to the underway ferrybox system. These observations were complemented with Water Insight Spectrometer and water profile data (by means of a CTD) and samples for zooplankton, pigment and nutrient analysis. A dedicated data workshop was organized with all partners to conduct a joint analysis on both the biotic and abiotic data. A first exploration of the data, by means of regression-based models and multivariate statistics, suggested that mainly nutrient discharges from the rivers influence the plankton structure. Furthermore, water turbidity is controlling photosynthetic activity and horizontal and vertical variations of photosynthetic properties can be discriminated.","Debusschere, E.; Mortelmans, J.; Tyberghein, L.; Artigas, L.F.; Creach, V.; de Blok, R.; Everaert, G.; Kromkamp, J.; Lizon, F.; Louchart, A.; Rijkeboer, M.; Deneudt, K.",,"Louchart, Arnaud, A.",,,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Journal article,Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,
