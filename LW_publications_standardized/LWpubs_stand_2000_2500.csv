Here, biodiversity was valued using an ecological approach based on the intrinsic value incorporated in biodiversity per se, regardless of any human association. The Marine Biological Valuation protocol was drawn upon the methodology of terrestrial valuation maps, to support the European MSFD environmental status assessment (descriptor 1 – biodiversity) and national marine spatial planning approaches. To apply the protocol on the Portuguese continental shelf we compiled and analyzed national biological databases for a wide taxonomic range of ecosystem components (seabirds, demersal fish, macrobenthos, marine mammals and sea turtles) and assessed the spatial overlap with existing and proposed conservation areas (Natura 2000 network). The resultant maps described patterns of biological value consistent with the physical and biological oceanographic conditions as well as local hydrodynamics of the Portuguese continental shelf. The results of our approach confirm previously identified valuable areas for protection (particularly in the northern and central regions), but also highlights the value of currently unprotected sites, mainly in the southern region. Biological valuation maps showed to be comprehensive tool to compile and spatially analyze biological datasets. By drawing attention to subzones of biological importance, it constitutes a valuable instrument in making appropriate-scale decisions on the spatial allocation of human activities in the context of the Portuguese marine spatial planning, currently facing the pressure and impacts of increased maritime exploitation.","Gomes, I.; Pérez-Jorge, S.; Peteiro, L.; Andrade, J.; Bueno-Pardo, J.; Quintino, V.; Rodrigues, A.M.; Azevedo, M.; Vanreusel, A.; Queiroga, H.; Deneudt, K.; Gomes, I.",WOS:000452692600054,"Pérez-Jorge, Sergi, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.05.040,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Assessment tool; Intrinsic value; Biodiversity; Ecolical criteria; Conservation; Marine spatial planning ,Journal article,,,"Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",Portugal,Assessment tool; Intrinsic value; Biodiversity; Ecological criteria; Conservation; Marine spatial planning,ECONOMIC VALUATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA; PROTECTED AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; RESERVES; IMPACTS; CONTEXT; SPACE; BAY,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Aveiro - Department of Biology,x,Portugal,,University,Science

Previous isotopic (δ<sup>18</sup>O) evidence of seasonal seafloor temperatures from serial ontogenetic sampling of bivalve mollusk shells indicated cool temperate winter (<10 °C) and/or summer (<20 °C) conditions but was limited to nine profiles from two species, one ranging into and one occurring exclusively in cool temperate settings at present.

Prior to die-off during rearing trials for paralarvae, it could be observed that the food-capturing paralarvae tended to be carried downward in a current induced by the aeration system, eventually depositing the animals on the tank bottom. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of upwelling water-flow, that might support paralarval swimming and floating, on paralarval survival and growth. A new artificial upwelling rearing system using a strong downward flow in the center to the bottom of the tank was developed. The effects of the new system in combination with supplying natural zooplankton (mainly decapod crustacean zoeae) or <i>Artemia</i> were evaluated using three different broods hatched from three mothers (broods A, B, and C). As food items for zooplankton, n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (n-3 HUFA)-fortified rotifers and digestible microalgae <i>Nannochloropsis oculata</i> were supplemented. The hatchling dry weight was significantly different among broods, showing heavier weight in order of broods  A > C  > B. Use of the upwelling rearing system significantly improved the rate of paralarval survival as compared with using the standard system, and paralarval growth was significantly faster when reared in the upwelling system with zooplankton supplementation. Paralarvae in the upwelling + zooplankton group kept high survival rates over 80% until 18 days after hatching (DAH). The survival rate of the tank of brood A could achieve 80.8% at 20 DAH, however, those of broods B and C dropped to 8.2% and 54.4% at 20 DAH, respectively, presumably due to combined effect of small hatchling size and insufficient food supply. The octopuses of broods A and C reached benthic stage by 25 and 23 DAH, with survival rates of 51.0% and 45.3%, respectively. The overall results suggest that an inadequate water-flow environment in combination with poor food quality and quantity are major causes of paralarval mortality of the common octopus. For culturing paralarvae, the combined use of an upwelling rearing system and supplying decapod crustacean zoeae supplemented with n-3 HUFA fortified rotifers and digestible <i>N. oculata</i> was recommended.","Dan, S.; Iwasaki, H.; Takasugi, A.; Yamazaki, H.; Hamasaki, K.",WOS:000439123500012,"Hamasaki, Katsuyuki, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.05.036,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Octopus vulgaris,,,Common octopus; Paralarval rearing; Mortality causes; Upwelling system; Natural zooplankton; Hatchling size,Journal article,,,"Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biosci, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088477, Japan.",Japan,Common octopus; Paralarval rearing; Mortality causes; Upwelling system; Natural zooplankton; Hatchling size,FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; VULGARIS PARALARVAE; CEPHALOPODA OCTOPODIDAE; REARING SYSTEM; ARTEMIA; CUVIER; LARVAE; ZOEAE; CRAB; DIET,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology,x,Japan,,University,Science

Actin organization and microtubules assembly, which are essential for intracellular transport and cell motility, can be disrupted by high hydrostatic pressure. High hydrostatic pressure can also damage DNA. Nucleic acids exposed to low temperatures can form secondary structures that hinder genetic information processing. To study how deep-sea creatures adapt to such a hostile environment, one of the most straightforward ways is to sequence and compare their genes with those of their shallow-water relatives. We captured an individual of the fish species Aldrovandia affinis, which is a typical deep-sea inhabitant, from the Okinawa Trough at a depth of 1550&amp;nbsp;m using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). We sequenced its transcriptome and analyzed its molecular adaptation. We obtained 27,633 protein coding sequences using an Illumina platform and compared them with those of several shallow-water fish species. Analysis of 4918 single-copy orthologs identified 138 positively selected genes in A. affinis, including genes involved in microtubule regulation. Particularly, functional domains related to cold shock as well as DNA repair are exposed to positive selection pressure in both deep-sea fish and hadal amphipod. Overall, we have identified a set of positively selected genes related to cytoskeleton structures, DNA repair and genetic information processing, which shed light on molecular adaptation to the deep sea. These results suggest that amino acid substitutions of these positively selected genes may contribute crucially to the adaptation of deep-sea animals. Additionally, we provide a high-quality transcriptome of a deep-sea fish for future deep-sea studies.","Lan, Y.; Sun, J.; Xu, T.; Chen, C.; Tian, R.; Qiu, J.-W.; Qian, P.-Y.",WOS:000433330800004,"Sun, Jin, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s12864-018-4720-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Positive selection; High hydrostatic pressure; Cold shock; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule,Journal article,,,"Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Life Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Positive selection; High hydrostatic pressure; Cold shock; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule,HIGH HYDROSTATIC-PRESSURE; COLD-SHOCK; MOLECULAR ADAPTATION; GENOME DUPLICATION; LOW-TEMPERATURE; IN-VIVO; MICROTUBULE; PROTEINS; ANNOTATION; ACTIN,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,,China,,University,Science

We investigated their distribution based on shell morphology and internal anatomy of epigean species, troglophilic populations, and troglobitic species. Distribution patterns of Potamolithus were compared to those of other aquatic taxa from the region (such as crustaceans and fishes). Besides the three species already described for the region, we recorded 12 additional ones, for a total of 15 species/morphs (six troglobites, seven troglophiles, and two epigean). Potamolithus spp. are restricted to micro-basins and/or caves, showing small areas of distribution and probably a high degree of endemism. Geomorphology (irregular landscape, with limestone outcrops intercalated with insoluble rocks, which probably act as geographic barriers for cave populations), paleoclimatic evidence, and ecological/biological factors, such as the low degree of mobility of these gastropods (sedentary habit), explain the distributional patterns. We observed troglomorphisms such as reduction/absence of eyes and pigmentation (body and periostracum), and a coiled intestine. Apparently, there is no cause-and-effect between miniaturization and intestine coiling for Potamolithus, in contrast to observations for other cave snails.

The cone snail fauna of the Miocene Gatun Formation of Colón Province, Panama is especially important for understanding the temporal and biogeographic history of tropical American Conidae. Intensive, focused collecting from an exposure of the lower Gatun Formation (deposited ca. 11–10 Ma) resulted in the discovery of nearly 900 specimens of Conidae. Remarkably, many of these well-preserved specimens exhibit revealed coloration patterns when exposed to ultraviolet light. The fluorescing coloration patterns were used in conjunction with other features of shell morphology to differentiate species and, in most cases, evaluate their potential relationships to members of the extant tropical American fauna. Nine species are fully described from this locality, one of which is recognized as new: <i>Conus (Stephanoconus) woodringi n</i>. sp.

The diversity of this Conidae fauna is considered moderate relative to other recently analyzed tropical American fossil assemblages.

MPAs and the species they protect, however, are increasingly being impacted by climate change. Here we show that, despite local protections, the warming associated with continued business-as-usual emissions (RCP8.5) will likely result in further habitat and species losses throughout low-latitude and tropical MPAs. With continued business-as-usual emissions, mean sea-surface temperatures within MPAs are projected to increase 0.035 °C per year and warm an additional 2.8 °C by 2100. Under these conditions, the time of emergence (the year when sea-surface temperature and oxygen concentration exceed natural variability) is mid-century in 42% of 309 no-take marine reserves. Moreover, projected warming rates and the existing ‘community thermal safety margin’ (the inherent buffer against warming based on the thermal sensitivity of constituent species) both vary among ecoregions and with latitude. The community thermal safety margin will be exceeded by 2050 in the tropics and by 2150 for many higher latitude MPAs. Importantly, the spatial distribution of emergence is stressor-specific. Hence, rearranging MPAs to minimize exposure to one stressor could well increase exposure to another. Continued business-as-usual emissions will likely disrupt many marine ecosystems, reducing the benefits of MPAs.","Bruno, J.F.; Bates, A.E.; Cacciapaglia, C.; Pike, E.P.; Amstrup, S.C.; van Hooidonk, R.; Henson, S.A.; Aronson, R.B.",WOS:000433904400021,"Pike, Elizabeth, E.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41558-018-0149-2,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Species of this genus, which live almost exclusively in subterranean water, offer an interesting model system for basic and applied biodiversity science. Their use, however, is often limited due to the hitherto unresolved taxonomy within the whole genus. As a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the currently >425 Niphargus species is too demanding, it has been suggested that the taxonomy of the genus could be advanced in smaller steps, by reviewing regional faunas, that would eventually integrate into a global revision. In this study, we provide such a revision of <i>Niphargus</i> in Switzerland. First, we molecularly delimited, morphologically diagnosed, and formally described two new species, namely <i>Niphargus luchoffmann</i> sp. n. and <i>Niphargus tonywhitteni</i>i sp. n. Second, we updated and revised a checklist of <i>Niphargus</i> in Switzerland with new findings, and prepared a list of reference sequences for routine molecular identification, available at BOLD and GenBank. All available specimens of 22 known species from the area were morphologically examined, and their morphological variation was compiled in a data file of DEscription Language for TAxonomy, which can be used for automated generation of dichotomous or interactive keys. The data file is freely available at the World Amphipoda Database. Together, the checklist, the library of reference sequences, the DELTA file, but also a list of hitherto unresolved aspects are an important step towards a complete revision of the genus within a well-defined and biogeographically interesting area in Central Europe.","Fišer, C.; Alther, R.; Zakšek, V.; Borko, S.; Fuchs, A.; Altermatt, F.",WOS:000433179000006,"Fišer, Cene, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/zookeys.760.24978,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Amphipoda, ""Niphargidae""",Groundwater,,barcodes; DELTA; integrative taxonomy; web-taxonomy,Journal article,,,"Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, SubBio Lab, Vecna Pot 111, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",Slovenia,Amphipoda; barcodes; DELTA; groundwater; integrative taxonomy; Niphargidae; web-taxonomy,CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; CRUSTACEA-AMPHIPODA; MIDDLE-EAST; PERFORMANCE; PHYLOGENY; DISPERSAL; DELTA; FAUNA; WATER,Zoology,Zoology,University of Ljubljana - Faculty of Biotechnology - Department of Biology - SubBio Lab,x,Slovenia,,Research institute,Science

We mapped the geographic range of <i>Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas</i>, and <i>T. tridentatus</i> using recent data from field work, literature, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and unpublished data from our scientific network. The data were correlated with 23 different environmental variables of potential ecological importance for horseshoe crabs using the openModeller webservices, including new tidal variables. Ecological niche models were generated using two algorithms, Maximum Entropy and support vector machine, for the three species under present conditions, and projected into a climate change scenario of 2050. The niches of the Asian horseshoe crabs were mostly determined by tidal regime, chlorophyll A concentrations, depth, distance to land, and sea surface temperature. According to our predictions, horseshoe crabs in Southeast Asia are not expected to experience any severe change in extent and distribution of suitable habitat in the future. In order to conserve Asian horseshoe crabs, we suggest establishing Marine Protected Areas at locations where distinct populations and several species occur, such as northern Vietnam, China, Borneo, and southern Japan.","Vestbo, S.; Obst, M.; Quevedo Fernandez, F.J.; Intanai, I.; Funch, P.",WOS:000457147900001,"Vestbo, Stine, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2018.00164,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,"Carcinoscorpius, ""Tachypleus"", ""Xiphosura""","Climate change, ""Conservation""",,ecological niche modeling; marine protected area; Xiphosura,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work discusses some traits of the Saudi deep waters of the Red Sea between 23°N and 28°N. Macrobenthic samples were collected using a box corer (0.1 m<sup>2</sup> surface area) from 59 stations at depths ranging between 220 m and 1678 m. The stations were categorized into four depth zones (≤500 m, 501–750 m, 751–1000 m and >1000 m) and two latitudinal areas (northern and central) for data analysis. A total of 186 species have been identified including polychaetes (135), crustaceans (27), molluscs (18), echinoderms (3), echiuroid (1), sipunculoid (1), and oligochaete (1). While 114 species were present in only 1–3 stations, only 30 species were found to be widely distributed, being recorded in all depth zones from northern and central areas. The trophic structure analysis indicated high functional diversity with the presence of seven feeding levels represented mainly by surface deposit feeders, facultative detritivores, and benthic carnivores. In general, the density and biomass of the deep sea macrobenthic community studied herein are lower than those reported in other seas with similar depth zones. This is most likely due to the particular environmental factors of the Red Sea, represented mainly by its oligotrophic nature, high temperature, high salinity, and low food availability in the form of organic matter. It is worth noting that some ecological parameters considered showed a general decreasing pattern (density: 10–1666 ind. m<sup>−2</sup>; biomass: 0.02 – 10.98 g m<sup>−2</sup>; species richness S: 1–59; Shannon-Wiener diversity index <i>H'</i>: 0 – 5.1) in relation with the increasing depth in northern and central areas. The bathymetric trends of the macrobenthic communities were also demonstrated with findings of multivariate analyses. The distribution of benthic communities at all depth zones appeared to be controlled by the availability of organic matter and abiotic factors such as temperature and salinity. Pronounced latitudinal and longitudinal trends in the macrobenthic communities are not evident, most likely due to the limited latitudinal and longitudinal variation of the sampling stations of this study. No spatial variations were found with the feeding types, species evenness index, and species dominance index.

The extent to which these anthropogenic habitats are sustainable sources of propagules and influence the evolution of NIS in natural habitats was examined in the edible seaweed Undaria pinnatifida, native to Asia and introduced to Europe in the 1970s. Following its deliberate introduction 40 years ago along the French coast of the English Channel, this kelp is now found in three contrasting habitat types: farms, marinas, and natural rocky reefs. In light of the continuous spread of this NIS, it is imperative to better understand the processes behind its sustainable establishment in the wild. In addition, developing effective management plans to curtail the spread of <i>U. pinnatifida</i> requires determining how the three types of populations interact with one another. In addition to an analysis using microsatellite markers, we developed, for the first time in a kelp, a ddRAD‐sequencing technique to genotype 738 individuals sampled in 11 rocky reefs, 12 marinas, and 2 farms located along ca. 1000 km of coastline. As expected, the RAD‐seq panel showed more power than the microsatellite panel for identifying fine‐grained patterns. However, both panels demonstrated habitat‐specific properties of the study populations. In particular, farms displayed very low genetic diversity and no inbreeding conversely to populations in marinas and natural rocky reefs. In addition, strong, but chaotic regional genetic structure, was revealed, consistent with human‐mediated dispersal (e.g., leisure boating). We also uncovered a tight relationship between populations in rocky reefs and those in nearby marinas, but not with nearby farms, suggesting spill‐over from marinas into the wild. Finally, a temporal survey spanning 20 generations showed that wild populations are now self‐sustaining, albeit there was no evidence for local adaptation to any of the three habitats. These findings highlight that limiting the spread of <i>U. pinnatifida</i> requires efficient management policies that also target marinas.","Guzinski, J.; Ballenghien, M.; Daguin-Thiébaut, C.; Lévêque, L.; Viard, F.",WOS:000447131200009,"Viard, Frédérique, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/eva.12647,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,artificial habitats; rocky reefs; invasive species; gene flow; adaptation; Genotyping by Sequencing,Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, Lab Adaptat & Divers Marine Environm, UMR CNRS SU 7144, CNRS, Roscoff, France.",France,adaptation; artificial habitats; gene flow; genotyping by sequencing; invasive species; rocky reefs,CRAB CARCINUS-MAENAS; R PACKAGE; ST-MALO; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; BROWN ALGA; LOCI; LAMINARIALES; INFERENCE; INVASIONS; AQUACULTURE,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,Joint Research Unit: Roscoff Marine Station (SBR) (UMR 7144),x,France,,Research network,Science

Two synergistic efforts identify specific priority variables for monitoring: Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) through the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) from the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). Both systems support reporting against internationally agreed conventions and treaties. GOOS, established under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), plays a leading role in coordinating global monitoring of the ocean and in the definition of EOVs. GEO BON is a global biodiversity observation network that coordinates observations to enhance management of the world’s biodiversity and promote both the awareness and accounting of ecosystem services. Convergence and agreement between these two efforts are required to streamline existing and new marine observation programs to advance scientific knowledge effectively and to support the sustainable use and management of ocean spaces and resources. In this context, the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), a thematic component of GEO BON, is collaborating with GOOS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), and the Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR) project to ensure that EBVs and EOVs are complementary, representing alternative uses of a common set of scientific measurements. This work is informed by the Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM), an intergovernmental body of technical experts that helps international coordination on best practices for observing, data management and services, combined with capacity development expertise. Characterizing biodiversity and understanding its drivers will require incorporation of observations from traditional and molecular taxonomy, animal tagging and tracking efforts, ocean biogeochemistry, and ocean observatory initiatives including the deep ocean and seafloor. The partnership between large-scale ocean observing and product distribution initiatives (MBON, OBIS, JCOMM, and GOOS) is an expedited, effective way to support international policy-level assessments (e.g., the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services or IPBES), along with the implementation of international development goals (e.g., the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals).","Müller-Karger, F.E.; Miloslavich, P.; Bax, N.J.; Simmons, S.E.; Costello, M.J.; Sousa Pinto, I.; Canonico, G.; Turner, W.; Gill, M.J.; Montes, E.; Best, B.; Pearlman, J.; Halpin, P.; Dunn, D.; Benson, A.; Martin, C.; Weatherdon, L.; Appeltans, W.; Provoost, P.; Klein, E.; Kelble, C.; Miller, R.J.; Chavez, F.P.; Iken, K.; Chiba, S.; Obura, D.; Navarro, L.M.; Pereira, H.M.; Allain, V.; Batten, S.; Benedetti-Cecchi, L.; Duffy, J.E.; Kudela, R.M.; Rebelo, L.-M.; Shin, Y.; Geller, G.N.",WOS:000457164900001,"Iken, Katrin, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2018.00211,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Essential Ocean Variables (EOV);  Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON); Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS); Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS); Marine Global Earth Observatory (MarineGEO); Integrated Marine Biosphere Research (IMBeR); Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs),Journal article,,,"Univ South Florida St Petersburg, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",USA,essential ocean variables (EOV); essential biodiversity variables (EBV); marine biodiversity observation network (MBON); global ocean observing system(GOOS); ocean biogeographic information system(OBIS); marine global earth observatory (MarineGEO); integrated marine biosphere research (IMBeR),TIME-SERIES; EARTH OBSERVATION; TOP-DOWN; MANAGEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; ZOOPLANKTON; PUBLICATION; PRIORITIES; DIVERSITY,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,"University of South Florida, St Petersburg",x,USA,,University,Science

Our findings highlight the importance of inclusive participation by all states in international negotiations and the urgency of clarifying the legal regime around access and benefit sharing of marine genetic resources.

A regularly interspaced strategy with a sample of 20% of the coastline provided the best compromise between usefulness (in terms of sampling cost and effort) and accuracy. However, model performance was strongly depen upon habitat characteristics.

We present novel evidence for widespread regulation of biodiversity. For 59 plant and animal assemblages from around the globe monitored annually for a decade or more, the majority exhibited regulated fluctuations compared to the null hypothesis of an unconstrained random walk. However, there was little evidence for statistical artifacts, regulation driven by correlations with average annual temperature, or local-scale compensatory fluctuations in <em>S</em> or <em>N</em>. In the absence of major environmental perturbations, such as urbanization or cropland transformation, species richness and abundance may be buffered and exhibit some resilience in their temporal trajectories.

While it is widely accepted that kelps harbour significant biodiversity, our current understanding of spatiotemporal variability in kelp-associated assemblages and the key environmental drivers of variability patterns remains limited. Here we examined the influence of ocean temperature and wave exposure on the structure of faunal assemblages associated with the holdfasts of Laminaria hyperborea, the dominant habitat-forming kelp in the northeast Atlantic. We sampled holdfasts from 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites nested within four regions across the UK, spanning ~9° in latitude and ~2.7° C in mean sea surface temperature. Overall, holdfast assemblages were highly diverse, with 261 taxa representing 11 phyla recorded across the study. We examined patterns of spatial variability for sessile and mobile taxa separately, and documented high variability between regions, between sites within regions, and between replicate holdfasts for both assemblage types. Mobile assemblage structure was more strongly linked to temperature variability than sessile assemblage structure, which was principally structured by site-level variability in factors such as wave exposure. Patterns in the structure of both biogenic habitat and associated assemblages did not vary predictably along a latitudinal gradient in temperature, indicating that other processes acting across multiple spatial and temporal scales are important drivers of assemblage structure. Overall, kelp holdfasts in the UK supported high levels of diversity, that were similar to other kelp-dominated systems globally and comparable to those recorded for other vegetated marine habitats (i.e. seagrass beds), which are perhaps more widely recognised for their high biodiversity value.","Teagle, H.; Moore, P.J.; Jenkins, H.L.; Smale, D.A.",WOS:000438457400051,"Smale, Dan, D.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0200411,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Marine Biol Assoc UK, The Lab, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, Devon, England.",England,,WAVE EXPOSURE; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; MACROFAUNAL COMMUNITY; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; SECONDARY PRODUCTION; SPECIES RICHNESS; REEF TOPOGRAPHY; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; SEA-URCHINS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Marine Biological Association (MBA),x,UK,,Research institute,Science

Specifically, we aim to account for the effects of trophic interactions at broad scales in ecological niche models (ENMs) of sea kraits (Laticauda: Reptilia) by including the potential distribution of food resources as predictor variables.  Location:  Oceania and Southeast Asia. Methods: First, we outline a simple method to generate biotic interaction variables for ENMs. We then test whether ENMs that include biotic interactions perform better than ENMs based on abiotic variables only. Results:  The models based on biotic interactions (i.e. trophic interactions) and abiotic variables slightly outperformed the models informed only by abiotic variables. We found a strong relationship between prey species richness and probability of distribution of predator (sea kraits). The models that included potential distributions of prey species as predictor variables showed an increase in proportion of pixels predicted present and a decrease in omission error, compared with models based only on abiotic variables.  Main conclusions:  Distribution estimates of predator species at broad scales are more accurate if calibration of ENMs includes relevant biotic variables (prey species richness, in this study). Hence, when data are available, biotic variables should be included in ENMs.","Gherghel, I.; Brischoux, F.; Papes, M.",WOS:000443394200019,"Papes, Monica, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.13361,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Range limits, range shifts, and lower thermal tolerance in the tropical barnacle <i>Megabalanus coccopoma</i>. All Dissertations, 1390. PhD Thesis. Clemson University: Clemson.  135 pp.","Climate change and species introductions are leading to shifts in marine species' geographic distributions. However, few studies have examined range limits and range shifts in tropical marine species. The barnacle Megabalanus coccopoma is native to shorelines from Baja California to Peru and has been introduced to a number of locations worldwide including the Atlantic US SE coast, where its current introduced range extends from Ft. Pierce, FL to Cape Hatteras, NC with seasonal populations as far north as Kitty Hawk, NC. In order to understand the potential poleward range limit of M. coccopoma in the US SE under modern day climate regimes, the larval and adult lower thermal tolerances were examined and larval energy budgets were used to estimate the potential extent of larval dispersal. The distribution of M. coccopoma was then surveyed within the Atlantic US SE during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. Changes in the range documented during these surveys were used to test the predictive accuracy of the species distribution model MaxEnt using data from the global range, the native range and the Atlantic US SE range. In contrast to work done with temperate species, which suggests larval thermal tolerances often set range limits, adult thermal tolerances corresponded most closely to current range limits. Larval energetic reserves may limit the extent of the seasonal range. Surveys revealed that, following the cold winter months of 2010, the range of M. coccopoma retracted down to northern Florida, rapidly re-expanded during 2011 and was re-established in its previous range by the summer of 2012. This range re-expansion is the fastest documented for any marine invertebrate and is one of the few documented for any tropical marine organism. When MaxEnt was used to predict the range retraction and range limits of M. coccopoma, only the MaxEnt model trained on the US SE data was able to accurately predict both the range retraction and range limits prior to the range retraction. Consideration of the range limiting mechanism(s) and spatial variation in the mechanism(s) is fundamentally important in accurately predicting range limits and even more so in predicting range shifts. In many marine species, and particularly in tropical species, lower limits to functionality and cumulative chill damage are likely the mechanisms responsible for setting poleward range limits at above freezing temperatures. Limited selection in tropical marine species for the ability to acclimate to cold temperatures may result in more ephemeral range expansions when compared to temperate species when both are moving poleward.","Crickenberger, S.E.",,"Crickenberger, Samuel Ewing, S.E.",,,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the impact of a natural nematode assemblage on the biomass and microbial community structure of a multispecies diatom biofilm. Nematodes stimulated diatom biomass accumulation of the biofilm and caused a shift in diatom community structure. Higher diatom biomass accumulation in the presence of nematodes could be the result of increased diatom biomass production through nutrient regeneration resulting from grazing or bioturbation, and/or through shifts in interspecific interactions between diatoms (e.g. competition) through selective grazing.

In venomous organisms, such as spiders, insects, scorpions and sea anemones, pore-forming proteins are often secreted as key components of the venom. Coluporins are pore-forming proteins recently discovered in the Mediterranean hematophagous snail <i>Cumia reticulata</i> (Colubrariidae), highly expressed in the salivary glands that discharge their secretion at close contact with the host. To understand their putative functional role, we investigated coluporins’ molecular diversity and evolutionary patterns. Coluporins is a well-diversified family including at least 30 proteins, with an overall low sequence similarity but sharing a remarkably conserved actinoporin-like predicted structure. Tracking the evolutionary history of the molluscan porin genes revealed a scattered distribution of this family, which is present in some other lineages of predatory gastropods, including venomous conoidean snails. Comparative transcriptomic analyses highlighted the expansion of porin genes as a lineage-specific feature of colubrariids. Coluporins seem to have evolved from a single ancestral porin gene present in the latest common ancestor of all Caenogastropoda, undergoing massive expansion and diversification in this colubrariid lineage through repeated gene duplication events paired with widespread episodic positive selection. As for other parasites, these findings are congruent with a “one-sided arms race”, equipping the parasite with multiple variants in order to broaden its host spectrum. Overall, our results pinpoint a crucial adaptive role for coluporins in the evolution of the peculiar trophic ecology of vampire snails.","Gerdol, M.; Cervelli, M.; Oliverio, M.; Modica, M.V.",WOS:000452567200005,"Gerdol, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/molbev/msy156,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, UMR5247, Montpellier, France.",France,transcriptomics; Gastropoda; hematophagy; cytolysins,RNA-SEQ DATA; SALIVARY-GLAND; FORMING TOXIN; PROTEIN TOXINS; EQUINATOXIN-II; VENOM GLAND; EVOLUTION; ACTINOPORINS; WEB; PREDICTION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Montpellier - Centre de Recherche en Biologie cellulaire de Montpellier (CRBM),x,France,,Research institute,Science

In many studies, short DNA sequences are binned into consecutively lower Linnaean ranks, and ranked groups (e.g., genera) are the units of biodiversity analyses. These analyses assume that Linnaean ranks are biologically meaningful and that identically ranked groups are comparable. We used a metabarcode dataset for marine planktonic diatoms to illustrate the limits of this approach. We found that the 20 most abundant marine planktonic diatom genera ranged in age from 4 to 134 million years, indicating the non-equivalence of genera because some have had more time to diversify than others. However, species richness was largely independent of genus age, suggesting that disparities in species richness among genera were better explained by variation in rates of speciation and extinction. Taxonomic classifications often do not reflect phylogeny, so genus-level analyses can include phylogenetically nested genera, further confounding rank-based analyses.

Projection scenarios for the end of this century show that tropical intertidal ecosystems are particularly at risk. In this study we optimized and tested a holistic method for bio-monitoring present and projected thermal pressure in such ecosystems, in order to assess organism vulnerability to ocean warming. Several species representative of different animal groups (fish, crustaceans and gastropods) were collected from the field and subjected to an experimental trial for 28 days, testing two temperatures: control (present seawater summer temperature) and elevated temperature (+3 °C, projected seawater temperature anomaly for 2100). Muscle samples were collected weekly to quantify several biomarkers of: i) macromolecular damage (protein unfolding and denaturation, and lipid peroxidation), ii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (antioxidant enzymes), and iii) body condition (energy reserves and body mass). These biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices, either in three separate stress response categories (as previously defined) or in a unique combined analysis of overall physiological performance. Both approaches suggest that temperature affected IBRs, with increasing temperatures significantly impairing the overall health of individuals. Biomarkers of lower levels of biological organization indicated deleterious effects of temperature, whereas biomarkers of higher levels suggested maintenance of performance after chronic exposure. Overall indices combining the estimates of biomarkers across levels of biological organization are essential to predict the vulnerability of species, or populations, to climate warming. Such indices may assist managers and stakeholders in the establishment of monitoring programs and environmental policies toward the conservation of fragile coastal systems.","Madeira, C.; Mendonça, V.; Leal, M.C.; Flores, A.A.V.; Cabral, H.N.; Diniz, M.S.; Vinagre, C.",WOS:000444625900005,"Leal, Miguel, M.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.152,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Tropical rocky reef; Ocean warming; Physiological performance; Stress biomarkers; IBRs; Environmental health assessment,Journal article,,,"Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",Portugal,Tropical rocky reef; Ocean warming; Physiological performance; Stress biomarkers; IBRs; Environmental health assessment,CRITICAL THERMAL MAXIMA; HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACCLIMATION CAPACITY; BIOMARKER RESPONSE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ENERGY RESERVES; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; HSP70,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Lisbon - Faculty of Science - MARE (Marine and Environmental Science Centre),x,Portugal,,Research institute,Science

Known until recently as the “Thalassinidea,” modern classification divided Axiidea into six families and Gebiidea into five. Ghost shrimps are characterized by having the first and second pereiopod chelate and a soft and delicate body, whereas mud lobsters possess the first pereiopod chelate or subchelate and second pereiopod subchelate or simple with a hard and heavily calcified body. Among the main body adaptations of these organisms are distinguished: (i) carapace laterally compressed, (ii) pleon longer than the cephalothorax in ghost shrimps but usually shorter in mud lobsters, and (iii) anterior feet thrown directly forward. Current accounting of axiideans and gebiideans reaches around 781 and 240 extant species, respectively, with major number of species in Callianassidae and Upogebiidae within of each clade. Male reproductive system involves paired testes linked to the vas deferens that open in gonopores on the ventral coxal segment of the fifth pereiopod. In females, the reproductive system is composed of paired and colored ovaries, one ovary shorter than another, and a pair of short and translucent oviducts linking each ovary to the gonopore, this latter located on the ventral coxal of the third pereiopod. When present in males, the first pleopod is sexually dimorphic. Most ghost shrimps show distinct sexual dimorphism in body size and the major cheliped which become them in a promising group for growth studies. Hypertrophied chelipeds in males are often used to defend galleries against invasion from other shrimps from the same or opposite sex or during the intense male-to-male competition for sexual partners. Knowledge about sexual systems of these species remains limited; however, available information suggests that hermaphroditism might be commonly present in axiideans and gebiideans. Regarding mating systems, all species of ghost shrimp and mud lobster with solitary habits and remarkable sexual dimorphism in the major cheliped are expected to be polygamous. Finally, considerable variability among Axiidea and Gebiidea species in fecundity and egg size may indicate important differences in the reproductive strategy and may also reflect a latitudinal trend as observed in other decapods.","Hernáez, P.",,"Hernáez, Patricio, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5772/intechopen.75067,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Thalassinidea,,,"Thalassinidea, taxonomy, ecology, sexual systems, mating systems, sexual dimorphism",Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seasonal variations of the taxonomic composition were analysed with regard to weather conditions and the physical and chemical properties of the environment. Two different patterns of annual phytoplankton succession were revealed for the post-winter period from March to November. After cold winters a classical annual succession of diatoms → dinoflagellates → coccolithophores → dinoflagellates → diatoms was observed, whereas after regular winters another type of succession; dinoflagellates → dinoflagellates → coccolithophores → diatoms → diatoms, took place. These two successions corresponded to seasonal dynamics of nitrate concentration and its share in the total inorganic nitrogen. During cold years these parameters decreased from spring to summer with a subsequent increase in autumn, whereas in regular years they were unusually high in summer. The enigma of this summer nitrate enrichment is well explained by the hypothesis of increasing cross-shelf nutrient transport. During regular years, weak hydrodynamic forcing occurs throughout the year, resulting in a large number of mesoscale eddies along the shelf in summer–autumn that in turn cause the intense transport of coastal waters rich in nitrate to the Sea interior. Development of the large-celled diatom <i>Pseudosolenia calcar-avis</i> in the sea basin observed in summer is in line with this hypothesis. This mechanism was also confirmed by positive relationships between the high sea-surface temperature, and the low Ekman pumping velocity and mean kinetic energy of currents in winter on the one hand, and the contribution of diatoms to the total phytoplankton biomass in summer–autumn, on the other. A case study of mesoscale eddies in the open waters in summer–autumn demonstrated a shift in species composition to large-celled diatoms inside these structures. Climate warming observed during the last 25 years resulted in a decrease in the frequency of cold winters from 30% to 15%, which has led to a decline in the annual phytoplankton standing stock. Thus, in the Black Sea, climate warming affects phytoplankton not directly by an increase in temperature, but by a decrease in the frequency of cold winters.","Mikaelyan, A.S.; Kubryakov, A.A.; Silkin, V.A.; Pautova, L.A.; Chasovnikov, V.K.",WOS:000453491000004,"Pautova, Larisa, L.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2018.08.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nakhimovski Prosp, Moscow 117997, Russia.",Russia,,LONG-TERM VARIATIONS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MESOSCALE VARIABILITY; CHLOROPHYLL; GROWTH; NUTRIENT; DIATOMS; COCCOLITHOPHORIDS; ASSIMILATION; DYNAMICS,Oceanography,Oceanography,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - P.P.

The marine environment has been a prolific contributor towards the identification of novel therapeutic agents in the recent few decades. Added to this, glycans (or carbohydrate- or sugar-based compounds) have in very recent decades made outstanding contributions to the development of novel therapeutics. This review brings together these significant facets of modern drug discovery by presenting the reported literature on glycans derived from marine organisms that possess antiviral activity.  The glycans have been grouped together based on the marine organism they were isolated from, namely, (1) bacteria, (2) chromists, (3) plants and (4) animals. For chromists, glycans are further subsectioned into Ochrophyta (brown algae), Miozoa (according to www.algaebase.org; also called Myzozoa according to WoRMS, www.marinespecies.org) (dinoflagellates) and Bacillariophyta (diatoms). For plants, glycans are further subsectioned into Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Tracheophyta. Glycans isolated to date are reported as alginates, chitosan, extracellular polysaccharides, fucans (e.g. fucoidans), galactans (e.g. carrageenans), glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, glycosides, glycosylated haemocyanin, laminarans, mannans, polysaccharides (not defined), rhamnans and xylomannans. Interestingly, many of the glycans displaying antiviral properties are sulfated.  Reports indicate that marine-sourced glycans have exhibited antiviral activity against African swine fever virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Epstein-Barr virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, human papilloma virus, human rhino virus, influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, murine leukaemia virus, murine sarcoma virus, Newcastle disease virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Semliki Forest virus, tobacco mosaic virus, vaccinia virus, varicella zoster virus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus.

Although the frequency of gastropods (96.5%) was much higher than that of bivalves (3.5%), species diversity was higher in bivalves. Among the Gastropoda, <i>Olivancillaria urceus</i> (Gmelin, 1791) was the most abundant species, with 611 individuals. Among the bivalves, <i>Anadara brasiliana</i> (Lamarck, 1819) had the most significant occurrence, with eight individuals.

This group of invertebrates has received extensive attention from biologists for many years because of their unique biological characteristics, such as the primitive form of the central nervous system and notable capability to regenerate tissues. Using freshwater planarians as test animals in chemical toxicity studies has grown in popularity since the 1960s. Results from various toxicological experiments have collectively suggested that freshwater planarians can serve as not only alternative models for chemical toxicity screenings in laboratories but also as potential bioindicators for the quality of freshwater environments. However, thus far, no standardized battery of tests for conducting toxicological studies that includes freshwater planarians has been proposed. This paper comprehensively reviews the toxicological information obtained from chemically exposed planarians and proposes practical factors for consideration in toxicity experiments with freshwater planarians as test organisms.","Wu, J.-P.; Li, M.-H.",WOS:000439956700006,"Wu, Jui-Pin, J.-P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.05.057,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Animal model; Environmental pollutant; Freshwater planarian; Invertebrate; Toxicology,Journal article,,,"Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geog, Environm Toxicol Lab, Taipei, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Animal model; Environmental pollutant; Freshwater planarian; Invertebrate; Toxicology,ACUTE TOXICITY; IN-VIVO; POLYCELIS-FELINA; DUGESIA-JAPONICA; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; ANIMAL-MODEL; NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION; NEUROBEHAVIORAL TOXICITY; SCHMIDTEA-MEDITERRANEA; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION,Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU),,Taiwan,,University,Science

To investigate how physical gradients impact sub-Arctic planktonic protists (> 20 μm), a seasonal transect study was performed in 2013 during three periods of planktonic succession: spring, summer, and autumn. The samples were collected from the glacier-fjord-ocean transect in SW Greenland using two complementary sampling methods, i.e. net hauls (20-μm net) and Niskin bottles. The key drivers of the distribution of planktonic groups and dominant taxa were hydrographic properties (defined as ‘time’, salinity, and temperature) reflecting the area’s seasonally changing circulation system. Cold and relatively saline waters in spring favoured the single haptophyte species <i>Phaeocystis</i> cf. <i>pouchetii</i>, while in summer, fresher waters influenced by glacial discharge favoured diatoms, followed by dinoflagellates and predatory ciliates in autumn. Our findings reveal a monodominant structure among the planktonic protists observed in each key sub-region and in each season. (1) <i>Gedaniella boltonii</i> (spring) was associated with inner fjord upwelling, (2) <i>Chaetoceros</i> sp.

Among a total of 188 species, a limited number of echinoderms, cephalopods and occasionally ascidians dominated the bulk of the community, covering up to 95% of the total wet weight. Seasonal and bathymetric variations were found in the different biodiversity patterns, with higher values in summer and in shallower depths, regarding overall wet weight (>14,000 kg/km<sup>2</sup>), density (>1 million ind/km<sup>2</sup>), richness and diversity (143 species; H’=1.74). The statistical differences in density and wet weight between bathymetric strata reflected in particular groups of species typifying each environment, but without any exclusiveness in depth preferences, since generalist species were the main components of the community. Depth was the main driver of statistical differences in the community structure, but a combined influence of geographic location was also identified from an interaction effect. Sediment type may be influencing habitat preferences, with echinoderms (especially crinoids <i>Leptometra</i> and <i>Antedon</i>), dominating on sandy substrates, and cephalopod mollusks (especially cephalopods Illex, Eledone, <i>Octopus</i>) dominating on muddy substrates. Trawling activity may also influence the dominance of some target and non-target species. Several infrequent bivalves, opistobranchs and species from phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa and Sipuncula constituted an important understudied component of the richness of this community.

Here, reproductive traits and the likely time of spawning for 12 of the approximately 16 species that occur at Hall Bank were established using histology between March 2009 and March 2011 at 7 discrete time points. Peak reproductive activity most likely occurs in February, as 7 of the 10 species sampled in this month had colonies with mature gametes. The sexuality, mode of larval development and transmission of symbionts were, as expected, consistent with previous work.

We compiled bleaching response data for multiple warming events in which corals were identified to species and then quantified the relationship between species’ traits and their general bleaching response. Coral family explained more variation between species bleaching responses (11%) than any other individual trait. Other morphological and physiological traits explained between 6.7 and 10.5% of total variation; however, the majority of variation was attributed to differences rather than any coral trait. Some relationships between bleaching response and species traits (e.g., symbiont genotype) vary greatly by study, suggesting that plasticity among individuals related to their history and characteristics of the location or warming event are stronger determinants of bleaching response than species-level traits. Conversely, other traits (e.g., family and growth form) describe enough variation in bleaching responses among species to be useful as predictors of bleaching in species assemblages. Discriminating among higher level coral taxa (family) in conjunction with recording colony growth form would significantly improve the capacity to predict assemblage responses to warming events.","Mizerek, T.L.; Baird, A.H.; Madin, J.S.",WOS:000441845500017,"Mizerek, Toni, T.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00338-018-1702-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Bleaching response; Coral traits; Monitoring; Thermal stress; Growth form ,Journal article,,,"US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Hagana, GU 96910 USA.",USA,Bleaching response; Coral traits; Monitoring; Thermal stress; Growth form,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; SUSCEPTIBILITIES; ZOOXANTHELLAE; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,,USA,,Governmental body,Policy

However, kleptoplast diversity studies conducted on <i>Plakobranchus</i> to date most likely underestimated the full diversity of kleptoplast sources within the studied populations due to limitations of the molecular techniques employed. Here, we apply a high throughput sequencing technique to assess kleptoplast diversity of <i>Plakobranchus</i> cf. <i>ianthobapsus</i>’ from 10 sites across the Main Hawaiian Islands during winter and summer seasons. In so doing, we effectively used <i>P.</i> cf. <i>ianthobapsus</i> as a novel sampling tool to explore diminutive algal communities, including the current distribution of the invasive alga “<i>Avrainvillea amadelpha</i>.” Our results show that <i>P.</i> cf. <i>ianthobapsus</i> sequesters chloroplasts from 23 algal species from across the siphonous green algal order Bryopsidales. We identified “<i>Avrainvillea amadelpha</i>” and <i>Codium edule</i> as new host species for <i>P.</i> cf. <i>ianthobapusus</i>, but their rarity among the data suggests they were most likely less preferential as hosts and were possibly utilized due to low abundance or unavailability of more preferable species, and therefore a response to starvation risk. Additionally, the identification of the highly invasive siphonous green alga “<i>A. amadelpha</i>” as a kleptoplast source provides new fine-scale range and distribution data for this problematic species. Overall kleptoplast diversity does not differ among sites, except in a coral-dominated, (i.e. not algal dominated) environment, suggesting that siphonous algal assemblages are common in algal-dominated ecosystems in the Hawaiian Islands. Diversity dissimilarity among seasons was recovered from the majority of sites sampled, supporting the need for seasonal data collection in algal diversity assessments. This case study using metabarcoding of sacoglossan kleptoplasts provides deeper insights into these plant-animal interactions with a better understanding of host use than previous studies using traditional molecular methods and illustrates how algal diversity studies on the scale of plastids can have implications for understanding algal community structure and invasive species dynamics.","Wade, R.M.; Sherwood, A.R.",WOS:000446022200013,"Sherwood, Alison, A.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.07.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Avrainvillea; Hawai‘I; Metabarcoding; rbcL,Journal article,,,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",USA,Avrainvillea; Hawai'i; Metabarcoding; rbcL,OCELLATUS SACOGLOSSA; ELYSIA-TIMIDA; SEA SLUGS; OPISTHOBRANCHIA; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; FOOD; RETENTION; CHLOROPLASTS; BRYOPSIDALES; DELIMITATION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Hawaii at Manoa,x,USA,,University,Science

The biodiversity and conservation status of the marine gastropod (Mollusca; Gastropoda) in Pulau Bidong, Terengganu, Malaysia. <i>AACL Bioflux 11(4)</i>: 988-1000","Pulau Bidong is known for its history as a Vietnamese refugee settlement during the Vietnam War in the 1970s. By the 1990s, this island was under the jurisdiction of the state government of Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia. Now, Pulau Bidong is the marine research centre for the Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT MaReSt). It is a low-lying ecosystem harbouring flora and fauna not yet discovered. To date, there is no documented evidence on richness, diversity, and abundance of molluscan fauna found on the island. This study aims to identify diversity, distribution, morphological characteristics, and conservation status following the International Union for Conservation for Nature (IUCN) of marine gastropods. Sampling was done in August 2017 at two selected stations using the Smith-McIntyre grab and dredge. A total of 140 individuals representing three subclasses, 14 families, and 25 species were found. The highest number of individuals collected belonged to <i>Minolia ceraunia</i> (Solariellidae), with 27 individuals, followed by <i>Margistrombus marginatus</i> (Strombidae), with 20 individuals. Ecological indices, like the Shannon index (H’) and Simpson index (D), showed that species diversity was 2.67±0.20 and 0.90±0.02, respectively, indicating moderate to high diversity. In addition, Margalef (Ma) and Menhinick (Me) indices showed high variation scores of 4.61±0.44 and 2.16±0.09, indicating high species richness. Similarly, Evenness (J’) and Equitability (Ep) recorded 0.65±0.09 and 0.86±0.04, respectively, showing high homogeneity and distribution pattern of species in relation to other species. All marine gastropods were categorised as 'Not Evaluated’ following IUCN. This study provided baseline information for malacology communities and highlighted insufficient information, so a proper assessment of conservation status can occur. Extending the sampling period is recommended, so further surveying and monitoring of other benthic taxa, including algae, crustaceans, molluscs, and polychaetes, can provide a comprehensive study useful for scientists and members, for future follow-up and evaluation programmes.

We targeted 850 protein coding genes (678,322 base pairs) in ca. 120 samples, spanning all (except one) known families of Conoidea and a broad selection of non-Conoidea neogastropods. The capture was successful for most samples, although capture efficiency decreased when DNA libraries were of insufficient quality and/or quantity (dried samples or low starting DNA concentration) and when targeting the most divergent lineages. An average of 75.4% of proteins was recovered, and the resulting tree, reconstructed using both supermatrix (IQ-tree) and supertree (Astral-II, combined with the Weighted Statistical Binning method) approaches, are almost fully supported. A reconstructed fossil-calibrated tree dates the origin of Conoidea to the Lower Cretaceous. We provide descriptions for two new families. The phylogeny revealed in this study provides a robust framework to re-interpret changes in Conoidea anatomy through time. Finally, we used the phylogeny to test the impact of the venom gland and radular type on diversification rates. Our analyses revealed that repeated losses of the venom gland had no effect on diversification rates, while families with a breadth of radula types showed increases in diversification rates, thus suggesting that trophic ecology may have an impact on the evolution of Conoidea.","Abdelkrim, J.; Aznar-Cormano, L.; Fedosov, A.; Kantor, Y.; Lozouet, P.; Phuong, M.; Zaharias, P.; Puillandre, N.",WOS:000452566800002,"Abdelkrim, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/molbev/msy144,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 26, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,exon-capture; Conoidea; phylogeny; supertree,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; READ ALIGNMENT; SYSTEMATICS; EVOLUTION; INFERENCE; RADULA; GENUS; TREE; CLASSIFICATION; MORPHOLOGY,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,"Joint Research Unit: Institue of Systematics, Evolution, Biodiversity (ISYEB) (UMR 7205)",x,France,,Research network,Science

In 2013, SES experienced an unusual rainfall event followed by cloud burst event at upper Himalayan regime. Average meiobenthic abundance declined considerably in the study area from early phase of monsoon (EM) (699 ± 1569.4 ind. 10 cm<sup>−2</sup>) to later one (LM) (437 ± 949.9 ind. 10 cm<sup>−2</sup>) probably due to high annual rainfall which completely flushed the estuary. Free-living marine nematodes were the dominant group among all other meiobenthic taxa in both phases of monsoon. Nematode community was made up of 49 genera in 22 families. Comesomatidae, Chromadoridae, Linhomoeidae and Xylidae were the richest and most abundant families. During both phases of monsoon, stations, which were represented by fine sediments and high amount of organic carbon, harbored higher meiofaunal densities and nematode diversity with a strong dominance of 1B and 2B trophic guilds of nematodes. Different feeding guilds of nematode would be able to reveal anthropogenic-induced stress, which could be useful in assessing ecological quality of estuarine ecosystems. The present study indicates that climate change mediated unusual monsoonal precipitation may notoriously affect the meiobenthic assemblages in tropical estuaries like SES. Thus, this study could be an important first stepping stone for monitoring the future environmental impact on meiobenthic community in the largest mangrove region of the world.","Ghosh, M.; Mandal, S.; Chatterjee, M.",WOS:000452692500015,"Ghosh, Moumita, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.067,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Climate change; Estuarine system; Free-living nematodes; Meiobenthos; Monsoon; Organic carbon,Journal article,,,"Presidency Univ, Marine Ecol Lab, Dept Life Sci, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, India.",India,Climate change; Estuarine system; Free-living nematodes; Meiobenthos; Monsoon; Organic carbon,ECOLOGICAL QUALITY ECOQ; LIVING MARINE NEMATODES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FORAMINIFERAL ASSEMBLAGES; NORTH-SEA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM; ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAKE VARANO,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Presidency University - Department of Life Sciences - Marine Ecology Laboratory,x,India,,Research institute,Science

However, despite a large number of scientific cruises, few published data on the nematode biodiversity and community structure are available from the abyssal nodule fields of the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). It is well known that CIOB harbors one of the largest high-grade nodule reservoirs and has therefore gained the most attention from industries and governments. Therefore, to adequately assess the potential environmental impacts of deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining in CIOB, more quantitative samples are needed to better understand trends in nematode diversity, abundance, and community structure in the nodule fields. Recently, on the basis of detailed surveys and analysis, a Test Mine Site (TMS) and Reference Mining Site (TRS) have been identified within the First Generation Mine Site (FGM) for further detailed studies. According to ISA guidelines, the TMS and TRS need to be similar in faunal abundance, composition and diversity, nodule abundances, metal grade and environmental data. As per the deep-sea environment conservation point of view, particularly to plan mining operations, the study has been done to check whether TMS and TRS have a similar type of faunal assemblage so that impacts and the ensuing loss of biota are minimized. To address this, we compared the composition and distribution of nematode communities at genus/species level from TMS and TRS. The average nematode density ranged from 71.68 ± 1.7 inds/10 cm<sup>2</sup> in the TRS and 91.23 ± 1.3 inds/10 cm<sup>2</sup> in the TMS. A total of 63 nematode genera belonging to 24 families were identified from TMS. The TRS samples supported 52 genera belonging to 20 families. A homogeneous community was observed at family/genus level from the TMS and TRS, particularly dominated by cosmopolitan nematode genera like <i>Acantholaimus, Halalaimus, Thalasomonhystera</i> and <i>Leptolaimus</i>. The TRS and TMS samples did exhibit a similar evenness (J'), and diversity (H’) suggesting a homogeneous nematode community throughout the area. Taxon diversity and richness estimators revealed that the current sampling design was able to characterize the majority of the nematode genera present. It can be suggested that the entire area of sampling is inhabited by a single, uniformly distributed, nematode assemblage at the genus level.This study also addresses whether or not nematode assemblages at genus/ species level inhabiting the bare sediment (soft sediment without nodules) in abyssal nodule fields are unique and differ from those found in the crevices of polymetallic nodules. As expected, there were fewer numbers of total genera recorded from the crevices with the differences being found in the dominant genera and families. <i>Thalassomonhystera, Acantholaimus</i> and <i>Desmoscolex</i> were noted as characteristic of the bare sediment while <i>Leptolaimus</i> and <i>Camacolaimus</i> showed the highest likelihood in nodule crevices. Hard nodule crevice substratum does favor some species level morphotypes of the genus <i>Leptolaimus</i> and <i>Camacolaimus</i> since these morphotypes were found exclusively in nodule crevices. However, owing to the still limited sampling effort in the deep sea, it is premature to suggest that these species are endemic to nodules.

Nematodes were more abundant and diverse at the most marine site while low numbers and diversity characterized the most contaminated station.

Following a description of the magnitude of the sea bottom temperature (SBT) rise, the changes in the distribution and occupancy of 65 benthic invertebrate species were analysed by comparing data collected throughout the English Channel at more than 200 stations sampled during a cool period in the 1960s–1970s and at present in 2012–2014. A non-uniform rise in SBT for the last three decades was observed at the regional scale, varying from 0.07 to 0.54°C per decade. This rise differs from that reported for sea surface temperature (SST) in stratified areas suggesting that SBT should be used rather than SST to analyse responses of subtidal organisms to climate change. Despite shifts in both minimum and maximum sea bottom isotherms (2.5 and 3.2 km.year<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), the distribution centroid shift of most species remained <1.0 km.year<sup>−1</sup>, regardless of the average temperatures they usually experience. Conversely, decreases were observed in the occurrence of most cold-water species and increases were found in the occurrence of most warm-water species.

No single existing scheme suitably reflected lanternfish assemblage distributions, but parsimonious boundaries from existing schema were identified.

Here, we present the first test of live–dead mismatch as an indicator of human stress using ostracodes. On three islands along a gradient of human population density in the Bahamas, we compared the similarity of living and death assemblages in 10 lakes with relatively low levels of human stress to live–dead similarity in 11 physically comparable lakes subject to industrial, agricultural, or other human activities currently or in the past. We find that live–dead agreement in pristine lakes is consistently excellent, boding well for using death assemblages in modern-day and paleolimnological biodiversity assessments. In most comparison of physically similar paired lakes, sample-level live–dead mismatch in both taxonomic composition and species’ rank abundance is on average significantly greater in the stressed lakes; live–dead agreement is not lower in all samples from stressed lakes, but is more variable. When samples are pooled for lake-level and island-level comparisons, stressed lakes still yield lower live–dead agreement, but the significance of the difference with pristine lakes decreases—species that occur dead-only (or alive-only) in one sample are likely to occur alive (or dead) in other samples. Interisland differences in live–dead agreement are congruent with, but not significantly correlated with, differences in human population density. This situation arises from heterogeneity in the timing and magnitudes of stresses and in the extent of poststress recovery. Live–dead mismatch in ostracode assemblages thus may be a reliable indicator of human impact at the sample level with the potential to be a widely applicable tool for identifying impacted habitats and, perhaps, monitoring the progress of their recovery.","Michelson, A.V.; Kidwell, S.M.; Park Boush, L.E.; Ash, J.L.",WOS:000452141100010,"Michelson, Andrew, A.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/pab.2018.20,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"SUNY Maritime Coll, Sci Dept, 6 Pennyfield Ave, Bronx, NY 10465 USA.",USA,,SAN-SALVADOR ISLAND; COMPOSITIONAL FIDELITY; SPECIES COMPOSITION; MARGINAL MARINE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OSAKA BAY; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; RECORD,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,State University of New York (SUNY),,,,,

These environments supported a diverse hygrophytic-halophytic vegetation, as well as an array of diatoms and gastropods. Using a regional hydrological model, we estimate that recharge rates from 1.5 to 4 times present were required to activate and maintain these wetlands in the past. Activation in the late Pleistocene was part of a regional enhancement of water resources, extending from the Andes, downstream and through riparian corridors, to the lowest and most arid portions of the desert itself.

While many studies have been carried out on the first two organisms, much lesser is known about the latter one, notably in this region. The assessment is our first attempt to explore the tunicates found in northern coastal waters of Ambon Island, an area that is a part of the Banda Sea. Two types of tunicates were obtained during the survey, namely the violet-green and white-yellow variants of solitary tunicates <i>Polycarpa aurata</i> (15 specimens) and social ones of <i>Didemnum molle</i> (3 specimens). The <i>Polycarpa</i> specimens' heights ranged from 2.5 to 4.8 cm with wet weights from 9.4 to 28.03 g, and the <i>Didemnum</i> ones were of 1.2 - 2 cm and wet weights from 1.2 to 5 g.

Unfortunately, defining species and creating robust phylogenies remain a serious challenge due to simple body plans that reduce the number of available morphological characters, slow mitochondrial sequence evolution and a complete absence of nuclear markers in the actiniarian molecular toolkit other than the ribosomal cistron. Defining species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships is imperative for advancing our understanding of sea anemone taxonomy and systematics. Herein, we utilized EPIC (exon‐priming intron‐crossing) primers, in addition to non‐standard PCR profiling conditions, to obtain sequence data for seven nuclear introns located within Calmodulin, Calpain, Nck Associated Protein 1 Homolog, Pescadillo Homolog, Signal Recognition Particle 54‐kDa Subunit, Transferase and Vacuolar ATP Synthase Subunit B. These new markers were employed to evaluate whether morphological variability in marginal tentacle protuberances is indicative of intraspecific variation or cryptic species in the shallow‐water anemone <i>Phymanthus crucifer</i>. Variability within these nuclear introns was compared to mitochondrial 12S, 16S and <i>cox3</i>, and nuclear 18S and 28S. PCR products of all nuclear introns were cloned to determine copy number and the resulting variability among clones was consistent with single‐copy markers. We also amplified and sequenced six of the seven introns in a sister species, <i>Phymanthus loligo</i>, to determine the degree of interspecific variation.

Three mitochondrial genes (i.e. <i>atp6</i>,<i> cox1</i>, and <i>nad4</i>) and 6,398 genome‐wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from 110 individuals from four hydrothermal vents and two methane seeps. When using the three mitochondrial genes, nearly no genetic differentiation was detected for <i>B. platifrons</i> in the Northwest Pacific. Nevertheless, when using SNP datasets, all individuals in the South China Sea (SCS) and three individuals in Sagami Bay (SB) together formed one genetic cluster that was distinct from the remaining individuals. Such genetic divergence indicated a genetic barrier to gene flow between the SCS and the open Northwest Pacific, resulting in the co‐occurrence of two cryptic semi‐isolated lineages. When using 125 outlier SNPs identified focusing on individuals in the Okinawa Trough (OT) and SB, a minor genetic subdivision was detected between individuals in the southern OT (S‐OT) and those in the middle OT (M‐OT) and SB. This result indicated that, although under the influence of the Kuroshio Current and the North Pacific Intermediate Water, subtle geographic barriers may exist between the S‐OT and the M‐OT. Introgression analyses based on these outlier SNPs revealed that Hatoma Knoll in the S‐OT represents a possible contact zone for individuals in the OT‐SB region. Furthermore, migration dynamic analyses uncovered stronger gene flow from Dai‐yon Yonaguni Knoll in the S‐OT to the other local populations, compared to the reverse directions.

To better understand hyperbaric constraints on depth distributions, we explored responses to high pressure of adult echinoderms from eastern Canada. The sea urchin <i>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</i>, the sea star <i>Leptasterias polaris</i> and the sea cucumber <i>Cucumaria frondosa</i> were exposed to various pressures within and beyond their known bathymetric distribution (i.e. surface pressure; pressure at the midpoint in bathymetric distribution; pressure at twice the maximum depth in the species bathymetric distribution) for different durations (24 h, 72 h, 9 days). Survival was compromised by exposure to the highest pressure levels, with the sea urchin exhibiting the highest mortality. After 72-h exposure, mortality was observed for sea urchin and sea cucumber individuals while all sea star individuals survived. Following 9-day exposure of sea star individuals to high pressure, 100% mortality occurred. Exposure to pressures typical of natural distributions had little effect on the selected health and motor metrics. Pressures atypical of natural ranges negatively affected the motor functions of all species, irrespective of exposure duration. During and after 24-h exposure, feeding was reduced in sea urchin and sea cucumber individuals, but was unchanged in sea star individuals. Overall, there were no clear signs of acclimation to high pressure following sustained periods of exposure in any species. These results highlight constraints applied by hydrostatic pressure beyond current bathymetric ranges on life-sustaining behaviours in echinoderms. The potential of long-lived echinoderms to survive downward migration to greater depths is species-specific, suggesting there may be winners and losers in the face of near-future climate-driven migration patterns.","Ammendolia, J.; Hamel, J.-F.; Mercier, A.",WOS:000441931000001,"Ammendolia, Justine, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-018-3399-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Mem Univ, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada.",Canada,,DEEP-SEA INVASION; SHRIMP PALAEMONETES-VARIANS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE; TOLERANCE; ACIDIFICATION; ACCLIMATION; INSIGHTS; STARFISH; IMPACTS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Memorial University of Newfoundland - Department of Ocean Science,x,Canada,,University,Science

Therefore, it is particularly important to indicate the processes that condition Hg accumulation in marine organisms, especially those in the basal links of the food chain, which are rather poorly investigated compared to top predators. The aim of the study was to determine the seasonal variability of Hg concentrations in macrozoobenthic organisms and the factors that condition it. The research was conducted in 2012–2013 in a temperate coastal zone (Gulf of Gdańsk). The obtained results showed that both Hg concentrations within one trophic level, and their seasonal variation, may differ significantly if the organisms have different feeding habits. The research also indicated that the seasonal variability of Hg level in macrozoobenthos depended on a number of both biotic factors (primary production volume, biomass and rate of fauna metabolism) and abiotic factors (salinity and ionic composition of water, Eh). The variability of Hg concentrations in macrozoobenthos during the study period was different at the research stations, which were subjected to different land influence (e.g. surface run-off, coastal erosion), and consequently differed in the quantity and quality of organic matter. The increased load of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was also an important factor influencing the increase in Hg concentration in macrozoobenthos, regardless of their trophic status. This indicates that SPM is an important source of food for zoobenthos, even in species that prefer a different feeding strategies. The obtained results also showed the role of climate changes observed in the temperate zone - in particular, the warming of the winter season - in shaping the Hg level in macrozoobenthos. The accumulation of Hg in the bottom fauna occurred most intensively in spring immediately after a long period of icing - Hg concentrations were then much higher than those measured after a mild winter, during which the ice cover persisted for a short time. The warming of the winter season and the extension of the vegetation season contributed to an increase in macrozoobenthic biomass, and consequently to the biodilution of Hg, which could have had a negative effect on the Hg load introduced into the trophic chain.","Jedruch, A.; Beldowska, M.; Graca, B.",WOS:000449247600037,"Graca, Bozena, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.08.040,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Mercury; Macrozoobenthos; Coastal food web; Trophic groups; Baltic Sea,Journal article,,,"Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Pilsudskiego 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland.",Poland,Mercury; Macrozoobenthos; Coastal food web; Trophic groups; Baltic Sea,NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; INORGANIC MERCURY; BALTIC SEA; FOOD WEBS; SALINITY; BIOMAGNIFICATION; METHYLATION; WATER; SEDIMENT,Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,University of Gdansk - Institute of Oceanography,x,Poland,,Research institute,Science

However, respective evolutionary studies are very scarce and the often high number of species flocks in ancient lakes across multicellular taxa raises the question whether unicellular species, such as diatoms, may radiate as well. Here, we use an integrative approach that includes molecular data from benthic diatom species of the genus <i>Aneumastus</i> endemic to ancient Lake Ohrid, fossil data obtained from the sediment record of a recent deep‐drilling project and biogeographical information to test if this group, indeed, constitutes a species flock. Molecular‐clock and phylogenetic analyses indicate a young monophyletic group of several endemic species. Molecular, fossil and biogeographical data strongly suggest a rapid intralacustrine diversification, which was possibly triggered by the emergence of novel habitats. This finding is the first evidence for a species flock in diatoms and suggests that <i>in situ</i> speciation is also a relevant evolutionary process for unicellular eukaryotes in isolated ecosystems.","Stelbrink, B.; Jovanovska, E.; Levkov, Z.; Ognjanova-Rumenova, N.; Wilke, T.; Albrecht, C.",WOS:000452501800018,"Stelbrink, Björn, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jeb.13368,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",Germany,ancient lakes; Aneumastus; molecular clock; phylogenetic analyses; sediment record,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; ANCIENT LAKES; BACILLARIOPHYTA; EVOLUTION; FOSSIL; EXTINCTION; RESILIENCE; SPECIATION; MACEDONIA; PRESPA,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Giessen - Dept Animal Ecology & Systematics,x,,,,

Here, to assess the effects of eutrophication on macrobenthic communities in the northern Adriatic Sea, we account for mixing with dating of the bivalve <i>Corbula gibba</i> at two stations with high accumulation (Po prodelta) and one station with moderate accumulation (Isonzo prodelta). We find that, first, pervasively bioturbated muds typical of highstand conditions deposited in the early twentieth century were replaced by muds with relicts of flood layers and high content of total organic carbon (TOC) deposited in the late twentieth century at the Po prodelta. The twentieth century shelly muds at the Isonzo prodelta are amalgamated but also show an upward increase in TOC. Second, dating of <i>C. gibba</i> shells shows that the shift from the early to the late twentieth century is characterized by a decrease in stratigraphic disorder and by an increase in temporal resolution of assemblages from ~25–50 years to ~10–20 years in both regions. This shift reflects a decline in the depth of the fully mixed layer from more than 20 cm to a few centimeters. Third, the increase in abundance of the opportunistic species <i>C. gibba</i> and the loss of formerly abundant, hypoxia-sensitive species coincided with the decline in bioturbation, higher preservation of organic matter, and higher frequency of seasonal hypoxia in both regions. This depositional and ecosystem regime shift occurred in ca. a.d. 1950. Therefore, the effects of enhanced food supply on macrobenthic communities were overwhelmed by oxygen depletion, even when hypoxic conditions were limited to few weeks per year in the northern Adriatic Sea. Preservation of trends in molluscan abundance and flood events in cores was enhanced by higher frequency of hypoxia that reduced bioturbation in the late twentieth century.","Tomasovych, A.; Gallmetzer, I.; Haselmair, A.; Kaufman, D.S.; Kralj, M.; Cassin, D.; Zonta, R.; Zuschin, M.",WOS:000452141100002,"Tomasovych, Adam, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/pab.2018.22,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Slovak Acad Sci, Earth Sci Inst, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia.",Slovakia,,GULF-OF-TRIESTE; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; LONG-TERM CHANGES; ORGANIC-MATTER; PO PLAIN; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; DINOFLAGELLATE CYSTS; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Slovak Academy Of Science - Institute of Earth Science,x,Slovakia,,Research institute,Science

This study aims to test the monophyly of the present concept of the family Bougainvilliidae, assessing its phylogenetic position within Hydroidolina. Our working hypothesis is used as a context for inferring the evolution of certain morphological characters, focusing on the exoskeleton. Our results shed light on some phylogenetic uncertainties within Hydroidolina, delimiting eight well‐supported linages, viz.

Some of the genera typically considered in Bougainvilliidae, including <i>Bougainvillia</i>, fell into the clade Pseudothecata, which is consistently reconstructed as the sister group of Leptothecata. We formally suggest that <i>Dicoryne</i> be removed from Bougainvilliidae and placed in the resurrected family Dicorynidae. The exoskeleton was a key feature in the diversification of Hydroidolina, especially with the transition from the bare hydranth to one completely enveloped within the exoskeleton. In this context, bougainvilliids exhibit several intermediate states in the development of the exosarc.

El Rosario Archipelago, located on the Colombian Caribbean shelf (SW Caribbean) consists of a set of ancient and successive coralline formations, uplifted by tectonic and diapiric activity. We undertook an integrated analysis of instrumental climate records and sediment records from a beach ridge system, a reef lagoon and a mangrove lagoon in the Archipelago, to determine whether historical extreme weather events influenced the coastal geomorphology and reef sedimentation. Statistical analysis of historical extreme winds and waves was accomplished using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Extreme sea-level events were identified with calibrated data from the nearest tide gauge. Sediments from the reef and mangrove lagoon were dated using <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>14</sup>C. Beach ridges were dated indirectly thorough their relationship with the closure of the mangrove lagoon. The eroding capacity of the historical extreme waves (i.e. maximum grain size that could be entrained by the orbital velocity of the waves) was compared with the grain sizes present in the deposits, and foraminifera species helped to determine the provenance of those deposits. Storms typically occur during the dry season associated with cold fronts. Foraminifera and coral fragments indicated that beach ridges were supplied with sediment that eroded from ancient terraces. In the reef lagoon, a 56-cm-thick unit of coarse coral and shell debris, grading to a finer sediment, represents a major high-energy event that occurred after ca. 1655 CE. This event was also recorded by the beach ridges. The probable explanation for this high energy unit is that a strong event carried coarse sediments into the lagoon, with subsequent reworking by minor events, such as those reported in the historical record. Two tsunamis occurred in the Caribbean after 1655, but the associated waves reaching the area were not strong enough to deposit the coarser clasts of the unit. Thus, coarser material was probably delivered to the lagoon as a consequence of sudden diapiric and/or tectonic activity. Our data show that major storms and other high-wind, extreme-wave events shape the beach ridges on Rosario Island, every 70 years. The findings suggest that if global climate change increases the frequency and/or magnitude of major storms and other high-wind, extreme wave events that impact the Caribbean coast of Colombia, then El Rosario Archipelago will be susceptible to future, significant landscape transformations.","Puerres, L.Y.; Bernal, G.; Brenner, M.; Restrepo-Moreno, S.A.; Kenney, W.F.",WOS:000444927500008,"Brenner, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.07.002,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Foraminifera,,,South Caribbean storms; Beach ridges; Coastal sediment records; Foraminifera,Journal article,,,"Univ Nacl Colombia Sede Medellin, Fac Minas, Dept Geociencias & Medio Ambiente, Medellin, Colombia.",Colombia,South Caribbean storms; Beach ridges; Coastal sediment records; Foraminifera,INDIAN-OCEAN TSUNAMI; BEACH RIDGES; CORAL-REEFS; NORTH QUEENSLAND; ROSARIO ISLANDS; SEA; CLIMATE; DEPOSITS; AMERICA; ORIGIN,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,"Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellin - Faculty of Minas - Department of Geosciences & Environment",x,Colombia,,University,Science

The amphipod stygobiont genus <i>Pseudoniphargus</i> is distributed across the Mediterranean region but also in the North Atlantic archipelagos of Bermuda, Azores, Madeira and the Canaries. We used species delimitation methods and mitogenome phylogenetic analyses to clarify the species diversity and evolutionary relationships within the genus and timing their diversification. Analyses included samples from the Iberian Peninsula, northern Morocco, the Balearic, Canarian, Azores and Madeira archipelagoes plus Bermuda. In most instances, morphological and molecular-based species delimitation analyses yielded consistent results. Notwithstanding, in a few cases either incipient speciation with no involvement of detectable morphological divergence or species crypticism were the most plausible explanations for the disagreement found between morphological and molecular species delimitations. Phylogenetic analyses based on a robust calibrated mitochondrial tree suggested that <i>Pseudoniphargus</i> lineages have a younger age than for other thalassoid amphipods displaying a disjunct distribution embracing both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. A major split within the family was estimated to occur at the Paleocene, when a lineage from Northern Iberian Peninsula diverged from the rest of pseudoniphargids. Species diversification in the peri-Mediterranean area was deduced to occur in early Miocene to Tortonian times, while in the Atlantic islands it started in the Pliocene. Our results show that the current distribution pattern of <i>Pseudoniphargus</i> resulted from a complex admix of relatively ancient vicariance events and several episodes of long- distance dispersal.","Stokkan, M.; Jurado-Rivera, J.A.; Oromí, P.; Juan, C.; Jaume, D.; Pons, J.",WOS:000446021300086,"Stokkan, Morten, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.07.002,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, C Miguel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Balearic Island, Spain.",Spain,,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; GROUNDWATER CRUSTACEANS; BETIC CORDILLERA; ANCHIALINE CAVE; MITOCHONDRIAL; EVOLUTION; MODEL; DISPERSAL; CHEVREUX,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

Specifically, we assessed quantity, quality, and sources of organic matter and their influence on the associated infaunal community and food web structure (feeding guild composition) at the methane outcrop, as well as at sites 20 m and 600 m away. We found greater patchiness in food composition at the outcrop site (containing clam beds) than the more distant locations. Trophic diversity (ES<sub>[10]</sub>) was significantly greater at the outcrop compared to that at the 20 m site, suggesting that the outcrop added rather than replaced trophic niche opportunities. Diversity (ES<sub>[10]</sub>) was lower at the outcrop compared to the other two sites, although not significantly so. We re-analysed the community data at higher spatial resolution (5 to 10 m, and lower replication) to identify the distance of influence of the hydrates habitat and found a transition from outcrop to background at 9 and 15 m away from the most active site, with greater similarity in the communities at 28 m to those at 600 m than the outcrop itself. Food quality (i.e., nutritional value for benthic organisms) and source played a significant role in determining food web structure, outweighing the influences of food quantity and sediment type. However, our distance-based linear model (distLM) using all variables, food quality, or topography explained only 33.56%, 33.54%, and 33.18% respectively of the total variation in feeding guild composition, suggesting important roles for other environmental variables. We conclude that the higher food patchiness in Barkley Hydrates compared to ambient sediments likely contributed to increased trophic niche opportunities.

The region is also economically important, supporting valuable fisheries, aquaculture and ecotourism industries. Deep-sea (>200 m depth) exploration leases for oil and gas have also recently been activated. Characterising the environment of the GAB is a priority in light of these activities, but although areas of the GAB continental shelf have been well-studied, there is a paucity of data on benthos from depths > 200 m and a virtual absence of collated benthic ecological information. Predictive ecological modelling is increasingly being used for deep-sea benthic characterisation given the large areas involved and logistic challenges of sampling these environments. For example, species distribution models can be used to predict environmental suitability in unsampled areas, and to inform spatial management for data-poor regions. We explored options and selected the maximum likelihood implementation of the popular MaxEnt method to predict environmental suitability for 96 deep-water benthic species across temperate Australia. Occurrence records were obtained from a collation of historical museum records, online databases and recent sampling in the GAB at 200–3000 m. Aggregated predictions were used to identify patterns of suitability across species. The GAB continental slope had high relative suitability across all modelled species, particularly in the phyla Chordata and Cnidaria, while predicted suitability for species in the phyla Mollusca and Arthropoda was generally higher on the east than south coast of Australia. These patterns were influenced by the suite of species used; we found predicted suitability within the GAB to be negatively influenced by the proportion of east coast records per species. Average bottom temperature, which correlated with depth and a range of water quality variables, was the most important environmental predictor of suitability. The currently poorly-sampled upper mid-slope depths (500–800 m) of the GAB had the greatest predicted suitability across the suite of modelled species; hence recent sampling of the GAB benthos may have underestimated benthic faunal abundance and diversity in this region.","Wiltshire, K.H.; Tanner, J.E.; Althaus, F.; Sorokin, S.J.; Williams, A.",WOS:000454184200011,"Sorokin, Shirley, S.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2018.06.011,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,MaxEnt; Stacked Species Distribution Model; Great Australian Bight; Continental slope; Temperate Australia,Journal article,,,"South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Aquat Sci, POB 120, Henley Beach, SA 5022, Australia.",Australia,MaxEnt; Stacked Species Distribution Model; Great Australian Bight; Continental slope; Temperate Australia,VULNERABLE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; GREAT-AUSTRALIAN-BIGHT; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; MAXENT; BIAS; IMPLEMENTATION; ASSEMBLAGES,Oceanography,Oceanography,SARDI (South Australian Research & Development Institute) - Aquatic Sciences Research Division,x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

Recently, the family-level classification of these venomous predator snails has undergone substantial changes, on the basis of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed combining partial mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, and up to 16 families are now recognized. However, phylogenetic relationships among these families remain largely unresolved. Here, we sequenced 20 complete or nearly complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which were combined with mt genomes available in GenBank to construct a dataset that included representatives of 80% of the known families, although for some we had only one species or genus as representative. Most of the sequenced conoidean mt genomes shared a constant genome organization, and observed rearrangements were limited exclusively to tRNA genes in a few lineages. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using probabilistic methods. Two main monophyletic groups, termed “Clade A” and “Clade B”, were recovered with strong support within a monophyletic Conoidea. Clade A (including families Clavatulidae, Horaiclavidae, Turridae <i>s.s</i>., Terebridae, Drilliidae, Pseudomelatomidae, and Cochlespiridae) was composed of four main lineages, one of which was additionally supported by a rearrangement in the gene order. Clade B (including families Conidae, Borsoniidae, Clathurellidae, Mangeliidae, Raphitomidae, and Mitromorphidae) was composed of five main lineages. The reconstructed phylogeny rejected the monophyly of Clavatulidae, Horaiclavidae, Turridae, Pseudomelatomidae, and Conidae, indicating that several of the currently accepted families may be ill-defined. The reconstructed tree also revealed new phylogenetic positions for genera characterized as tentative (<i>Gemmuloborsonia</i>, <i>Lucerapex</i>, and <i>Leucosyrinx</i>), enigmatic (<i>Marshallena</i>) or challenging to place (<i>Fusiturris</i>), which will potentially impact the classification of the Conoidea.","Uribe, J.E.; Zardoya, R.; Puillandre, N.",WOS:000446021300079,"Zardoya, Rafael, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.06.037,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 26, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; MITOGENOMIC PHYLOGENY; DNA SEQUENCE; IQ-TREE; CLASSIFICATION; EVOLUTION; NEOGASTROPODA; NOMENCLATOR; INFERENCE; MRBAYES,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Sorbonne Université,,France,,University,Science

Despite being a dominant component in continental aquatic ecosystems and crucial for determining priority areas for conservation, broad‐scale data on gastropod total species, endemic and threatened species richness are limited. Based on these biodiversity indices, we identify global hotspots, extinction risk along the elevational gradient and the drivers of species richness patterns in the largest group of freshwater gastropods, the family Hydrobiidae.Given the strong dependency to a nonmarine aquatic environment, the observed richness patterns of extant hydrobiid species could be significantly influenced by large‐scale geography and dispersal processes as well as climatic conditions affecting continental ecosystems. Therefore, we tested several predictions for species richness derived from ecological and evolutionary hypotheses postulated for other freshwater groups.Based on a comprehensive literature and biodiversity database review, we compiled the number of total, endemic and threatened species per freshwater ecoregion. We classified ecoregions as hotspots if each biodiversity index was in the top 25% of its range and assessed the effect of 13 environmental and evolutionary factors on species richness using generalised linear models.We identified 906 species and 157 genera of Hydrobiidae showing mainly a Nearctic–Palearctic distribution and 19 biodiversity hotspots, most located across the Mediterranean Basin. In our data set, 83% of the species were endemic to a single ecoregion. Of the 43% non‐data deficient species, we found almost three times more threatened than non‐threatened species, and extinction risk peaked at 1,500 m a.s.l. Species richness was unequally distributed over biogeographic realms, increased with higher connectivity among ecoregions, and was negatively related with annual temperature range. Latitude and precipitation seasonality explained part of the richness variation by a nonlinear relationship.The identified hotspots correspond with those of other freshwater taxa. The hump‐shaped relationship of extinction risk with elevation is likely the consequence of decreasing natural and anthropogenic perturbations at higher elevations. Global hotspots of Hydrobiidae richness represent areas of climatic stability with medium precipitation and temperature seasonality that are well connected with other hydrological basins. Our results illustrate that both evolutionary and environmental factors determine these global patterns and that future changes of the latter factors may affect hydrobiid richness.","Miller, J.P.; Ramos, M.A.; Hauffe, T.; Delicado, D.",WOS:000448881700004,"Miller, Jonathan, J.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/fwb.13128,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CSIC, Muse Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain.",Spain,biodiversity; distribution; endemism; freshwater gastropods; threats,FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; CAENOGASTROPODA TRUNCATELLOIDEA HYDROBIIDAE; DIVERSITY PATTERNS; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; GREAT-BASIN; GENUS; CONSERVATION; GASTROPODA; MOLLUSCA,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,CSIC - National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

Among animals, 60% of the species are micro- and meiofauna though this faunal component is still insufficiently known. These figures are similar to records from the southern North Sea and therefore may by typical for temperate climate sedimentary coastal areas. A comparison with the total of marine species suggests that the small benthic fauna may be severely understudied over most of the world. Analysis of global change depends on sound baseline data and species inventories like this can assist in the detection of biodiversity changes.

In this work, we selected nine bacterial strains—five with demonstrated and four with predicted PhaZ activity—to compare their effectiveness at degrading PHB film provided as sole carbon source. Each of the strains with demonstrated activity were able to use the PHB film (maximum mass losses ranging from 12% after 2 days for <i>Paucimonas lemoignei</i> to 90% after 4 days for <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp.), and to a lower extent <i>Marinobacter algicola</i> DG893 (with a predicted PhaZ) achieved PHB film mass loss of 11% after 2 weeks of exposure. Among the strains with proven PhaZ activity, <i>Ralstonia</i> sp. showed the highest specific activity since less biomass was required to degrade the polymer in comparison to the other strains. In the case of <i>Ralstonia</i> sp., PHB continued to be degraded at pH values as low as pH 3.3–3.7. In addition, analysis of the extracellular fractions of the strains with demonstrated activity showed that <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i>, <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp., and <i>Ralstonia</i> sp. readily degraded both PHB film and PHB particles in agar suspensions. This study highlights that whole cell cultures and enzymatic (extracellular) fractions display different levels of activity, an important factor in the development of PHB-based applications and in understanding the fate of PHB and other PHAs released in the environment. Furthermore, predictions of PhaZ functionality from genome sequencing analyses remain to be validated by experimental results; PHB-degrading ability could not be proven for three of four investigated species predicted by the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) depolymerase engineering database.","Martínez-Tobón, D.I.; Gul, M.; Sauvageau, D.",WOS:000442570500031,"Martínez-Tobón, Diana, D.I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00253-018-9153-8,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Comamonas testosteroni, ""Cupriavidus"", ""Marinobacter algicola"", ""Ralstonia""",,,Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); PHB depolymerase (PhaZ); Comparative polymer biodegradation; Microbial and enzymatic activity; Comamonas testosteroni; Cupriavidus sp.; Ralstonia sp.; Marinobacter algicola DG893 ,Journal article,,,"Univ Alberta, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",Canada,Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); PHB depolymerase (PhaZ); Comparative polymer biodegradation; Microbial and enzymatic activity; Comamonas testosteroni; Cupriavidus sp.; Ralstonia sp.; Marinobacter algicola DG893,EXTRACELLULAR POLY(3-HYDROXYBUTYRATE) DEPOLYMERASE; MICROBIAL-DEGRADATION; PSEUDOMONAS-LEMOIGNEI; ENZYMATIC DEGRADATION; CLONING; GENE; SEQUENCE; FILM; POLY(3-HYDROXYBUTYRATE-CO-3-HYDROXYVALERATE); POLYHYDROXYALKANOATES,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,University of Alberta - Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering,x,Canada,,University,Science

We detail here a new archaeoacoustics method that cross-compares a sequence of human-performed sound sources along with a standard electronic acoustical test signal across survey points. This efficient and rigorous archaeological experiment produced extensible data and observations regarding Inca-designed site sonics and multi-directional communication dynamics. Our experiment design combines ecologically valid acoustical measurements with subjective researcher-observer data to chart sound transmission and reception of different classes of sound-producers, enabling the identification of environmental contingencies, and the estimation of site acoustical features. Calibrated, multiply repeated sonic test signals were measured from a strategically chosen set of geo-located and photo-documented source and receiver locations in absolute, relative, and subjective terms, simultaneously for each source-receiver pair. This method offers a systematic and comprehensive understanding of site-specific sonic dynamics via in-field observations and data recording, frequency-range comparison across test signals, attention to acoustical metrics and psychoacoustical precedents, and emphasis on practical repeatability for a range of archaeologically relevant sound sources. Our study posits the central platform at Huánuco Pampa as a strategic point for Inca elites to both observe and influence activities across the site, a finding extensible to other such platforms. The prominent architectural platform would serve as a tool for multi-directional communication, as well as to facilitate messaging about elite presence and imperial identity through the projection of sonic-visual displays. Beyond producing data about Huánuco Pampa and Inca architecture, our case-study implementation of this new method demonstrates an efficient and systematic approach to tracing the acoustical contingencies of architectural materials in archaeological contexts.","Kolar, M.A.; Covey, R.A.; Cruzado Coronel, J.L.",WOS:000436640900001,"Kolar, Miriam, M.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40494-018-0203-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Huánuco Pampa; Inca soundscapes; Inca administration; Inca platforms; Inca communication; Archaeoacoustics; Acoustical survey method; Archaeological soundscapes; Archaeoacoustical methodology; Pututu acoustics,Journal article,,,"Five Coll Inc, 97 Spring St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",USA,Huanuco Pampa; Inca soundscapes; Inca administration; Inca platforms; Inca communication; Archaeoacoustics; Acoustical survey method; Archaeological soundscapes; Archaeoacoustical methodology; Pututu acoustics,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Analytical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Spectroscopy",Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Chemistry; Materials Science; Spectroscopy,Five Colleges Inc,x,USA,,Company,Industry

In HPLC analysis, the control fish liver tissue showed no significant changes, whereas the diclofenac-exposed fish liver tissue showed a significant peak with a quicker run time. The studies confirmed that the diclofenac compound affects hepatocytes to a noteworthy extent. Therefore, this calls for reduction of diclofenac usage and also to have a checkpoint especially for diclofenac in the pharmaceutical effluent released into the water bodies.","Geetha, V.; Sujata, R.; Shreenidhi, K.S.; Sundararaman, T.R.",WOS:000439622000009,"Geetha, Vijaya, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.15244/pjoes/75829,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pangasius,,,pharmaceutical industry; diclofenac; Pangasius sp,Journal article,,,"Rajalakshmi Engn Coll, Dept Biotechnol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",India,pharmaceutical industry; diclofenac; Pangasius sp.,FATE,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Rajalakshmi Engineering College - Department of Biotechnology,x,India,,University,Science

Recently, a possible new <i>Beroe</i> species was suggested based on internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences from samples collected in Svalbard, Norway. Another species, <i>Beroe ovata</i>, was introduced to Europe from North America, initially in the Black Sea and subsequently (and possibly secondarily) into the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. In areas where ctenophores have been introduced, they have often had significant detrimental ecological effects. The potential for other cryptic and/or undescribed <i>Beroe</i> species and history of spread of some species in the genus give reason for additional study. When alive, morphological hallmarks may be challenging to spot and photograph owing to the animals’ transparency and near-constant motion. We sampled and analyzed 109 putative <i>Beroe</i> specimens from Europe, using morphological and molecular approaches. DNA analyses were conducted using cytochrome oxidase 1 and internal transcribed spacer sequences and, together with published sequences from GenBank, phylogenetic relationships of the genus were explored.

Based on a number of summer surveys (July to September, 2010, 2012 and 2014), macrobenthic communities and their spatial-temporal patterns are exhibited for the majority of the Bering Sea (53°59′–64°36′N). The results show that the macrobenthic communities were dominated by northern cold-water species and immigrant eurythermic species, and the communities assumed a dispersed and patchy distribution pattern. Polychaetes (<i>Scoloplos armiger</i>), crustaceans (<i>Ceradocus capensis</i>) and sea urchins (<i>Echinarachnius parma</i>) were the main dominant groups in the shallow shelves; the sea star (<i>Ctenodiscus crispatus</i>) and the brittle star (<i>Ophiura sarsii</i>) were the main dominant groups in the continental slope; whereas small polychaetes (<i>Prionospio malmgreni</i>) dominated the basin area. Sediment type, water depth, and currents were the major factors affecting the structure and spatial distribution of the macrobenthic communities. Compared with other seas, the shallow areas of the Bering Sea showed an extremely high-standing biomass. In particular, the northern shelf area (north of St. Lawrence Islands and west of 170°W), which is primarily controlled by Anadyr Water, is an undersea oasis. In contrast, a deficiency in the downward transport of particulate organic carbon has resulted in a desert-like seabed in the basin area. By comparing our results to previous studies, we found that macrobenthic communities of the Bering Sea have undergone significant structural changes in recent decades, resulting in a decrease in abundance and an increase in biomass. In addition, populations of amphipods and bivalves in the northern shelves have decreased significantly and have been gradually replaced by other species. These changes might be associated with advanced seasonal ice melting, changes in organic carbon input, and global warming, indicating that large-scale ecosystem changes have been occurring in the Bering Sea.","Lin, H.; Liu, K.; Wang, J.; Huang, Y.; Li, Z.; Lin, J.; He, X.; Zhang, S.; Mou, J.; Wang, Y.; Xing, B.",WOS:000434813500010,"Wang, Yu, Y.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13131-018-1192-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"macrobenthos, community structure, Arctic, Bering Sea, environmental drivers",Journal article,,,"State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 3, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,macrobenthos; community structure; Arctic; Bering Sea; environmental drivers,CHUKCHI SEAS; MACROFAUNAL PRODUCTION; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; BENTHIC ECOLOGY; ARCTIC-OCEAN; GREEN BELT; BOHAI SEA; PACIFIC; BIOMASS; PRODUCTIVITY,Oceanography,Oceanography,State Oceanic Administration (SOA) - Lab Marine Biol & Ecol,x,,,,

We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species (NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall, we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort, richness patterns were not, suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS, with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall, we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats. However, richness estimates and species assignments require caution.

Understanding the spatial structure and interrelationships of benthic communities and their underlying environmental drivers, therefore, is of great importance. The benthic community off the sub‐Arctic Lofoten‐Vesterålen islands was studied on multiple spatial scales, using the MEM (Moran's eigenvector maps) framework to identify spatial structure in broad‐scale (100s of km), meso‐scale (20 km), and small‐scale (1.5 km) epifaunal and infaunal communities. A combination of eigenvector‐based multivariate analyses and variation partitioning on multiple sets of explanatory variables was used to identify characteristic species and environmental drivers that have a high importance in structuring the communities. Community structure of both epifauna and infauna strongly reflected the boundary of warm‐Atlantic (> 0.5°C) and cold‐Arctic water masses (< 0.5°C), which coincides approximately with the 800 m isobath in this region. Apart from this dominant broad‐scale determinant, epifauna and infauna displayed different spatial patterns and drivers. Both components differ significantly across local marine landscapes, however, this characterization is not sufficient for infauna, where additional sediment characteristics play an important role in structuring the community across all spatial scales. Within marine landscapes (meso‐scale), epifauna displays a spatial structure that for the most part could not be attributed to any of the included environmental drivers. The case of the Lofoten‐Vesterålen region demonstrated that the used analysis is a valuable tool in spatial planning, as it allows for comparison of the relative importance of individual environmental drivers for the studied faunal components, without losing the information about spatial patterns associated with individual drivers.","Silberberger, M.J.; Renaud, P.E.; Buhl-Mortensen, L.; Ellingsen, I.H.; Reiss, H.",WOS:000457652200015,"Buhl-Mortensen, Lene, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ecm.1325,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Akvaplan Niva, Fram Ctr Climate & Environm, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",Norway,continental shelf; deep sea; environmental drivers; epifauna; infauna; Lofoten-Vesteralen region; multivariate multiscale spatial analysis; Norwegian Sea; spatial planning,MARGINAL ICE-ZONE; BARENTS SEA; ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS; SPECIES RICHNESS; NORTHERN NORWAY; MARINE; DIVERSITY; TEMPERATURE; CLASSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Akvaplan Niva - FRAM Centre (High North Research Centre for Climate and the Environment),x,Norway,,Consultancy,Industry

This collection represents 79% of the species which inhabit Scottish waters and is a greater number and proportion of extant species than any previous regional study. The study is also of significance globally where the data augment the growing database of mineralogical analyses and offers first analyses for 26 genera and four families. Specimens were collated through a combination of field sampling and existing collections and were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-XRD to determine wt% MgCO<sub>3</sub> in calcite and wt% aragonite. Species distribution data and phylogenetic organisation were applied to understand distributional, taxonomic and phylo-mineralogical patterns. Analysis of the skeletal composition of Scottish bryozoans shows that the group is statistically different from neighbouring Arctic fauna but features a range of mineralogy comparable to other temperate regions. As has been previously reported, cyclostomes feature low Mg in calcite and very little aragonite, whereas cheilostomes show much more variability, including bimineralic species. Scotland is a highly variable region, open to biological and environmental influx from all directions, and bryozoans exhibit this in the wide range of within-species mineralogical variability they present. This plasticity in skeletal composition may be driven by a combination of environmentally-induced phenotypic variation, or physiological factors. A flexible response to environment, as manifested in a wide range of skeletal mineralogy within a species, may be one characteristic of successful invasive bryozoans.","Loxton, J.; Spencer Jones, M.; Najorka, J.; Smith, A.M.; Porter, J.S.",WOS:000435090700016,"Smith, Abigail, A.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0197533,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",Scotland,,CALCIUM-CARBONATE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; MAGNESIUM; SHELL; CHEILOSTOMATA; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; DIFFRACTION; ECTOPROCTA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Edinburgh - School of Geoscience,x,UK,,University,Science

Anthropogenic changes to our planet are decreasing species diversity through the negative effects of pollution, habitat destruction, direct extirpation of species, and climate change. But major biotic changes – including those that have both increased and decreased species diversity – have happened before in Earth’s history. Biodiversity dynamics in past eras provide important context to understand ecological responses to current environmental change. The work of assessing biodiversity is woven into ecology, environmental science, conservation, paleontology, phylogenetics, evolutionary and developmental biology, and many other disciplines; yet, the absolute foundation of how we measure species diversity depends on taxonomy and systematics. The aspiration of this symposium, and complementary contributed talks, was to promote better understanding of our common goals and encourage future interdisciplinary discussion of biodiversity dynamics. The contributions in this collection of papers bring together a diverse group of speakers to confront several important themes.

Females of two new deep-water species of harpacticoid copepods belonging to the <i>Hase</i> gen. n. (Aegisthidae: Cerviniinae) are described. The first taxonomic description of marine copepod species based on the combined use of interference and confocal microscopy for the study of the habitus and dissected appendages is presented here. CLSM (Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy) is a non-destructive method, comparable in quality to SEM (scanning electron microscopy) at the same magnifications. To observe and reconstruct in detail the habitus and dissected appendages, whole specimens and dissected parts were stained with Congo Red, mounted on slides with glycerine for CLSM and scanned under three visible-light lasers. <i>Hase lagomorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n. and <i>Hase talpamorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n. were collected from the sediments of the Southern Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea, from 2270 m and 5468 m depths, respectively. <i>Hase</i> gen. n. is included within Cerviniinae based on the caudal rami which are relatively divergent. <i>Hase</i> gen. n. is the sister taxon of <i>Cerviniella</i> based on the following synapomorphies: sturdy body, exopodites 1–3 of pereopods 1–3 heavily built, transformed into digging limbs, with strong outer and distal spines/setae, two-segmented endopod on the pereopods 2 and 3, and a reduced pereopod 5. Compared to <i>Cerviniella, Hase</i> gen. n. exhibits a more developed armature on the pereopod 1, which has outer and distal elements transformed into strong and long spines vs. stiff setae on <i>Cerviniella. Hase</i> gen. n. has one or two strong and long spines on the inner margin of the exopodite 3 of pereopod 4 and pereopod 5 is fused to the somite, ornamented with three distal setae. The telson of <i>Hase</i> gen. n. is subquadratic, and the furca is among the shortest yet described for Aegisthidae. The new species differ in a number of diagnostic characters, three of which are: a) the somite bearing pereopods 3 and 4 with latero-distal spiniform processes in <i>H. talpamorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n. but smooth in <i>H. lagomorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n., b) antenna is armed with three stout spines on the lateral inner margin of the exopod in <i>H. talpamorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n. and two proximal setae in <i>H. lagomorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n., and c) pereopod 4 exopodite 3 has two long and strong spines on the inner margin in <i>H. lagomorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n. and one spine in <i>H. talpamorphicus</i> gen. et sp. n.

The usefulness of published optical micrographs of the early life-history stages of bivalves is limited because of the great morphological similarity of the imaged articulated shells, particularly at the early (straight-hinge) developmental stages. While a number of techniques have been refined in recent years and show promise for use in routine identifications of larval and post-larval bivalves (e.g., single-step nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction; in situ hybridization protocols through color coding with taxon-specific, dye-labeled DNA probes; coupled fluorescence in situ hybridization and cell sorting; and image analysis techniques using species-specific shell birefringence patterns under polarized light), no adequate comprehensive reference source exists that accurately depicts the morphology and morphometry of the shells of larval and post-larval stages of target bivalve species in a consistent format to assist in identification of such stages. To this end, scanning electron micrograph (SEM) sequences are presented of the disarticulated shell valves of laboratory-reared larval and post-larval stages of 56 species of bivalve molluscs from a wide spectrum of marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats. Emphasis is placed on the usefulness of the morphology and morphometrics of consistently-oriented, disarticulated shell valves and associated hinge structures in discriminating the early life-history stages of these various bivalve species. Although the scanning electron micrograph sequences presented accurately depict the gross morphologies/ morphometrics and hinge structures of the disarticulated shell valves of the larvae and/or postlarvae of the 56 species of bivalves, it is important to emphasize that a scanning electron microscope is not necessary to observe even fine hinge structures associated with the early ontogenetic stages of these species. Such structures are readily visible using a wide range of optical compound microscopes equipped with high-intensity reflected light sources, although the disarticulated shell valves must be viewed in several planes of focus to discern the often subtle details seen clearly in the scanning electron micrographs. These morphological characters provide researchers with invaluable aids for the routine identification of the early life-history stages of these species isolated from plankton and benthic samples.","Lutz, R.A.; Goodwin, J.D.; Baldwin, B.S.; Burnell, G.; Castagna, M.; Chapman, S.; Chestnut, A.; Dabinett, P.; Davis, C.; Eversole, A.G.; Fuller, S.C.; Gallager, S.M.; Goldberg, R.; Goodsell, J.; Grassle, J.; Gustafson, R.G.; Hidu, H.; Hu, Y.-P.; Jablonski, D.; Johnson, S.; Kennedy, V.S.; Pennec, M.L.; Mann, R.; Newell, C.; Pooley, A.S.; Tan, A.S.; Vrijenhoek, R.C.; Partridge, A.",WOS:000435219000002,"Johnson, Shannon, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.037.0202,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,"bivalve, larvae, postlarvae, identification, scanning electron microscopy",Journal article,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",USA,bivalve; larvae; postlarvae; identification; scanning electron microscopy,SEMIAUTOMATED IMAGE-ANALYSIS; EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES; NESTED MULTIPLEX PCR; CAPE-COD ESTUARY; NEW-ZEALAND; SHELL DEVELOPMENT; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; PALLET MORPHOLOGY; CHESAPEAKE BAY; OYSTER LARVAE,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Rutgers State University,x,USA,,University,Science

The aim of this study is to investigate the mollusc composition and diversity occurring within Spanish vermetid bioconstructions. During the late summer 2013, three distant sites along the Mediterranean coast of Spain were sampled by scraping off the vermetid shells to study their associated assemblages. A total of 600 molluscs were identified within the classes of Polyplacophora (four species), Gastropoda (35 spp.) and Bivalvia (18 spp.). Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in composition and trophic diversity of mollusc assemblages among the three sites, highlighting a clear geographical gradient. Overall, both herbivores (grazers and deposit feeders) and omnivores were the quantitatively dominant trophic groups, while carnivores (predators and ectoparasites) were very scarce. Our results point out that mollusc assemblages associated with vermetid bioconstructions are rich and diversified, both in populations structure and trophic diversity, confirming the important role of vermetid gastropods as ecosystem engineers and biodiversity enhancers in shallow coastal waters.","Donnarumma, L.; Sandulli, R.; Appolloni, L.; Sánchez-Lizaso, J.L.; Russo, G.F.",WOS:000448402500048,"Sandulli, Roberto, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d10030096,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Vermetidae,,,mollusc diversity; Vermetidae; trophic categories; intertidal; Mediterranean Sea ,Journal article,,,"CoNISMa Natl Interuniv Consortium Marine Sci, I-00196 Rome, Italy.",Italy,,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Scienze del Mare (CoNISMa),,Italy,,Other public authorities,Policy

However, despite their wide application there are potential biases, mainly due to imperfect detectability and the behavioral responses of fish to the observers.  Methods: The performance of two methods of UVSs were compared to test whether they give similar results in terms of fish population density, occupancy, species richness, and community composition. Distance sampling (line transects) and plot sampling (strip transects) were conducted at 31 rocky reef sites in the Aegean Sea (Greece) using SCUBA diving.  Results: Line transects generated significantly higher values of occupancy, species richness, and total fish density compared to strip transects. For most species, density estimates differed significantly between the two sampling methods. For secretive species and species avoiding the observers, the line transect method yielded higher estimates, as it accounted for imperfect detectability and utilized a larger survey area compared to the strip transect method. On the other hand, large-scale spatial patterns of species composition were similar for both methods.  Discussion: Overall, both methods presented a number of advantages and limitations, which should be considered in survey design. Line transects appear to be more suitable for surveying secretive species, while strip transects should be preferred at high fish densities and for species of high mobility.","Thanopoulou, Z.; Sini, M.; Vatikiotis, K.; Katsoupis, C.; Dimitrakopoulos, P.G.; Katsanevakis, S.",WOS:000435832400008,"Thanopoulou, Zoi, Z.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.5066,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Underwater visual census, Line transects, Strip transects, Rocky reefs, Bias, Mediterranean, Belt transects",Journal article,,,"Aegean Univ, Dept Environm, Mitilini, Greece.",Greece,Underwater visual census; Line transects; Strip transects; Rocky reefs; Bias; Mediterranean; Belt transects,REEF FISHES; GAS PLATFORMS; TRANSECT; CENSUS; ABUNDANCE; POPULATION; BEHAVIOR,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of the Aegean,,Greece,,University,Science

Anthracological analysis shows that the human groups selected mostly shrub species for their fires. Archaeozoological information indicates that hunting specialising in red deer predominated, while fishing salmonids and shellfishing (mostly limpets and periwinkles) were complementary activities to hunting and gathering plants. Other economic activities practiced in the cave were the fabrication of osseous implements and objects of adornment made with animal raw materials.

Results of BIOENV analysis showed that water depth and sediment silt-clay percentage were the most important factors contributed to the differences of biological traits of marine nematode assemblages in summer, while sediment phaeophorbide content best explained the differences of marine nematode assemblages in winter.

Sampling was done by R/V Ferdos 1 from 49 00E to 57 00E during January–March 2013.In this study, 130 stations within the 10-20 m, 20-30 m and 30-50 m depths were sampled. Abundance and biodiversity of demersal fish communities at different depth strata were evaluated by various indices. In summary, of 113 taxa identified, only 91 fish species were found typically demersal, 6 were pelagic and 16 were other marine organism groups. The results showed that 4.4% of 113 species have critically imperiled status, 5.3% are imperiled and 9.7% appear to be rare but not immediately imperiled. The indices value of Shannon for entire investigated area (10-50 m depths) were 3.14, Simpson 0.04 (D) and 0.96 (1-D), Pielou 0.72, Margalef 8.45 and Menhinick 0.15.Sorenson’s coefficient between depths was 0.97 that shows high similarity in the depth strata. In general, the results of abundance and biodiversity indices indicate that, the health score is fair but this region is under stress.","Niamaimandi, N.; Valinassab, T.; Daryanabard, R.",WOS:000437852500002,"Niamaimandi, Nassir, N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.4194/1303-2712-v18_12_02,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Species diversity,,demersal resources; Northern Persian Gulf,Journal article,,,"AREEO, IFSRI, Iran Shrimp Res Ctr, POB 1374, Bushehr, Iran.",Iran,Species diversity; demersal resources; Northern Persian Gulf,SEA; ASSEMBLAGES; DECLINE; FISH,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,"Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection - Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO) - Iranian Fisheries Science Research Institute (IFSRI) - Iran Shrimp Research Center",x,Iran,,Research institute,Science

Data from 101 dredging operations were analysed for contrasting spatial and seasonal variability of damage, with the use of a three-level damage scale. 4.5% of discarded individuals displayed intermediate damage, whereas 11.3% displayed severe damage. Echinoderms displayed the highest level of damage (~75% of total collected individuals) and <i >Echinocardium cf. mediterraneum</i> was the most susceptible discarded species (85% with severe damage), followed by bivalves (7.3%) and crustaceans (3.3%). The target <i>Chamelea gallina</i> showed a low proportion of damaged individuals, probably due to their thick protective shell, which promotes the survival of discarded undersized target individuals. Spatial differences in damage level on discards were linked to some gear characteristics, to the higher amount of gravels and to longer tow durations, whereas damage was generally higher in cold months and partly related to higher quantities of hard shelled molluscs, in both cases increasing the abrasion and damage to retained organisms. Data suggest that dredges with a lower number of narrower iron teeth and towed for a shorter time could decrease the damage rate in discards of this fishery. A spatial management plan based on the type of grounds would be useful in order to improve efficiency of these fisheries and minimize their impact to soft bottoms with different commercial catches and biological communities.","Urraca, J.L.; Garcia, T.; León, E.; Gallardo-Roldán, H.",WOS:000466568200003,"León, Estefanía, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315418000462,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Puerto Pesquero S-N, Fuengirola 29640, Spain.",Spain,Alboran Sea; artisanal fisheries; Chamelea gallina; damage; discards; dredging impact,PORTUGUESE CLAM; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS; NEPHROPS FISHERY; ADRIATIC SEA; MESH SIZE; DAMAGE; IMPACT; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO),,Spain,,Research institute,Science

Despite its considerable importance to fisheries, knowledge on this marine ecosystem is only limited. Here, parasites were used as indicators to gain insight into the host ecology and food web of two pelagic fish species, the commercially important species <i>Trichiurus lepturus</i> Linnaeus, 1758, and <i>Nealotus tripes</i> Johnson, 1865<i>.</i> Fish specimens of <i>T. lepturus</i> (<i>n</i> = 104) and <i>N. tripes</i> (<i>n</i> = 91), sampled from the Canary Current System off the Senegalese coast and Cape Verde Islands, were examined, collecting data on their biometrics, diet and parasitisation. In this study, the first parasitological data on <i>N. tripes</i> are presented. <i>T. lepturus</i> mainly preyed on small pelagic Crustacea and the diet of <i>N. tripes</i> was dominated by small mesopelagic Teleostei. Both host species were infested by mostly generalist parasites. The parasite fauna of <i>T. lepturus</i> consisted of at least nine different species belonging to six taxonomic groups, with a less diverse fauna of ectoparasites and cestodes in comparison to studies in other coastal ecosystems (Brazil Current and Kuriosho Current). The zoonotic nematode <i>Anisakis pegreffii</i> occurred in 23% of the samples and could pose a risk regarding food safety. The parasite fauna of <i>N. tripes</i> was composed of at least thirteen species from seven different taxonomic groups. Its most common parasites were digenean ovigerous metacercariae, larval cestodes and a monogenean species (Diclidophoridae). The observed patterns of parasitisation in both host species indicate their trophic relationships and are typical for mesopredators from the subtropical epi- and mesopelagic. The parasite fauna, containing few dominant species with a high abundance, represents the typical species composition of an eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem.","Alt, K.G.; Kuhn, T.; Münster, J.; Klapper, R.; Kochmann, J.",WOS:000441110900005,"Alt, Katharina, K.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.5339,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Nealotus tripes, ""Trichiurus lepturus""",,,Food-web; Subtropical East-Atlantic; Eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem; Canary Current ,Journal article,,,"Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Frankfurt, Germany.",Germany,Food-web; Nealotus tripes; Subtropical East-Atlantic; Trichiurus lepturus; Eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem; Canary Current,CUTLASSFISH TRICHIURUS-LEPTURUS; ANISAKID NEMATODES; LIFE-CYCLE; HYSTEROTHYLACIUM-ADUNCUM; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; METAZOAN PARASITES; NORTHWEST AFRICA; ATLANTIC; PACIFIC; ECOSYSTEM,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre,x,,,,

However, the chronic release of nutrients can cause a shift in local primary productivity and a chronic increase in the sedimentation of organic material at a large spatial scale which could be reflected in benthic ecosystems. In this context, the indirect effects of aquaculture on the benthic ecosystem were studied in a semi-closed bay (Cephalonia, Ionian Sea) where a relatively large fish farm has been operating since 1982. Results from the present sampling were compared to historical data obtained in 1996 and 2001, in order to detect if nutrient release that could impact phytoplankton dynamics in the bay could indirectly alter benthic communities, as well. Macrofaunal communities have not shown deterioration but rather a small, yet statistically significant, improvement in diversity indices and ecological status indicators, and no significant change regarding bioturbation potential. This indicated that processes involved in nutrient consumption and transfer are highly effective in such an oligotrophic environment.","Tsikopoulou, I.; Moraitis, M.L.; Tsapakis, M.; Karakassis, I.",WOS:000439227100001,"Moraitis, Manos, M.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10661-018-6846-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Long-term changes,,Aquaculture indirect impacts; Benthic ecology; Ecological status; Bioturbation potential  ,Journal article,,,"Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Marine Ecol Lab, Iraklion 70013, Greece.",Greece,Aquaculture indirect impacts; Long-term changes; Benthic ecology; Ecological status; Bioturbation potential,MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL AREAS; LONG-TERM; ORGANIC ENRICHMENT; ECOLOGICAL STATUS; SALMON FARM; QUALITY; IMPACT; EUTROPHICATION; ASSEMBLAGES; NUTRIENTS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Crete - Department of Biology - Marine Ecology Lab,x,Greece,,Research institute,Science

We examined the relative importance of density dependence, winter sea surface temperature (SSTW) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on polychaete dynamics. All species studied showed conspicuous abundance oscillations, consistent with negative density-dependent population feedbacks. Model selection across a suite of population dynamic models showed that for six species, the best model included the effect of environmental variables, SSTW in the previous year, while the SOI index was the relevant variable in two polychaete species. A pure density-dependent model best explained the population dynamics of the remaining five species.

Due to the lack of a comprehensive contourite database, the link between vigorous bottom water activity and drift occurrence has yet to be demonstrated on a global scale. Using an eddy-resolving ocean model and a new georeferenced database of 267 contourites, we show that the global distribution of modern contourite drifts strongly depends on the configuration of the world most powerful bottom currents, many of which are associated with global meridional overturning circulation. Bathymetric obstacles frequently modify flow direction and intensity, imposing additional finer-scale control on drift occurrence. Mean bottom current speed over contourite-covered areas is only slightly higher (2.2 cm/s) than the rest of the global ocean (1.1 cm/s), falling below proposed thresholds deemed necessary to re-suspend and redistribute sediments (10–15 cm/s). However, currents fluctuate more frequently and intensely over areas with drifts, highlighting the role of intermittent, high-energy bottom current events in sediment erosion, transport, and subsequent drift accumulation. We identify eddies as a major driver of these bottom current fluctuations, and we find that simulated bottom eddy kinetic energy is over three times higher in contourite-covered areas in comparison to the rest of the ocean. Our work supports previous hypotheses which suggest that contourite deposition predominantly occurs due to repeated acute events as opposed to continuous reworking under average-intensity background flow conditions. This suggests that the contourite record should be interpreted in terms of a bottom current susceptibility to experiencing periodic, high-speed current events. Our results also highlight the potential role of upper ocean dynamics in contourite sedimentation through its direct influence on deep eddy circulation.","Thran, A.C.; Dutkiewicz, A.; Spence, P.; Müller, R.D.",WOS:000430767500022,"Spence, Paul, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.02.044,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Contourites,,Contourite; sediment drift; ocean modelling; meridional overturning circulation; eddy; bottom current,Journal article,,,"Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, EarthByte Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Australia,contourite; sediment drift; ocean modelling; meridional overturning circulation; eddy; bottom current,WESTERN BOUNDARY CURRENT; NORTHERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; SOUTH CHINA SEA; DEEP-WATER; OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES; SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION; NEPHELOID LAYERS; CONTINENTAL RISE; BOTTOM CURRENTS; NEW-ZEALAND,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Geochemistry & Geophysics,University of Sydney - School of Geosciences,x,,,,

Statistical tests for phylogenetic signal show that coloured shells are not distributed evenly across the class. The phylogenetic distribution of colour is statistically significant, as are the distributions of individual shell and periostracal colours. Blue and green shells are rare, with non-iridescent blue and green coloration occurring on the outer side of the valve more commonly in the periostracum than in the shell matrix and on the inside of valves in species that produce proteinaceous sheets overlying calcareous shell. These findings suggest that these colours in bivalves are attributable to pigments that are more easily incorporated into organic material than into calcareous shell. Ancestral state reconstructions show that the ancestral bivalves likely had a coloured shell. Although similar colours can arise from different pigments or from structural elements, the broad-scale phylogenetic distribution of colour in Bivalvia, along with the co-occurrence of ‘sets’ of colours, probably reflects, in part, the distribution of classes of pigments. This confirms the idea that the major classes of pigments found in molluscan shells are evolutionarily ancient and continue to contribute to shell coloration, despite recent genomic evidence suggesting that protein moieties associated with pigments might be evolutionarily diverse.","Grant, H.E.; Williams, S.T.",WOS:000450042700015,"Grant, Heather, H.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/biolinnean/bly122,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,bivalve; colour; phylogenetic signal; pigment,Journal article,,,"Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",England,bivalve; colour; phylogenetic signal; pigment,HALIOTIS-DISCUS-HANNAI; PATINOPECTEN-YESSOENSIS; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; PACIFIC ABALONE; GENETIC-CONTROL; MYTILUS-EDULIS; PERIOSTRACUM; PIGMENTS; SCALLOP,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,Natural History Museum (NHM),,,,,

Here, we analysed the gamma-diversity (γ-diversity) partitioning of gobiid fishes to evaluate the additive and multiplicative components of α and β-diversity, species replacement and species loss and gain, at four spatial scales: sample units, ecoregions, provinces and realms. The richness of gobies from the realm Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is represented by 87 species. Along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, we found that the γ-diversity is explained by the β-diversity at both spatial scales, ecoregions and provinces. At the ecoregion scale, species are diverse in the north (Cortezian ecoregion) and south (Panama Bight ecoregion) and between insular and coastal ecoregions. At the province scale, we found that the species turnover between the warm temperate Northeast Pacific (WTNP), Tropical East Pacific (TEaP) and the Galapagos Islands (Gala) was high, and the species nestedness was low. At the ecoregion scale, historical factors, and phylogenetic factors have influenced the hotspots of gobiid fish biodiversity, particularly in the Cortezian, Panama Bight and Cocos Island ecoregions, where species turnover is high across both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. At the provincial level, we found that the contributions of the β-diversity from north to south, in the WTNP, TEaP and Gala were high, as result of the high number of unique species.

Large molecular datasets capable of providing sufficiently high phylogenetic resolution, such as mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes), are needed to infer their evolutionary history with confidence, but isopod mitogenomes remain remarkably poorly represented in public databases. We sequenced the complete mitogenome of <i>Cymothoa indica</i>, a species belonging to a family from which no mitochondrial genome was sequenced yet, Cymothoidae. The mitogenome (circular, 14484 bp, A+T = 63.8%) is highly compact, appears to be missing two tRNA genes (trnI and trnE), and exhibits a unique gene order with a large number of rearrangements. High compactness and the existence of palindromes indicate that the mechanism behind these rearrangements might be associated with linearization events in its evolutionary history, similar to those proposed for isopods from the <i>Armadillidium</i> genus (Oniscidea). Isopods might present an important model system to study the proposed discontinuity in the dynamics of mitochondrial genomic architecture evolution. Phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood) conducted using nucleotide sequences of all mitochondrial genes resolved Oniscidea and Cymothoida suborders as paraphyletic. <i>Cymothoa indica</i> was resolved as a sister group (basal) to all remaining isopods, which challenges the accepted isopod phylogeny, where Cymothoida are the most derived, and Phreatoicidea the most basal isopod group. There is growing evidence that Cymothoida suborder might be split into two evolutionary distant clades, with parasitic species being the most basal split in the Isopoda clade, but a much larger amount of molecular resources carrying a high phylogenetic resolution will be needed to infer the remarkably complex evolutionary history of this group of animals with confidence.","Zou, H.; Jakovlic, I.; Zhang, D.; Chen, R.; Mahboob, S.; Al-Ghanim, K.A.; Al-Misned, F.; Li, W.-X.; Wang, G.-T.",WOS:000444222400027,"Chen, Rong, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0203089,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,,TRANSFER-RNA GENES; TERRESTRIAL ISOPODS; DEEP-SEA; INVERTED REPEATS; CRUSTACEA; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCE; PERACARIDA; HETEROPLASMY; SELECTION,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Chinese Academy of Sciences - Minististry of Agriculture - Key Lab Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology,,,,,

It may remain unnoticed until it shows up on coral reefs, beaches and in other coastal habitats. Stony corals have fragile skeletons and soft tissues that can easily become damaged when they get in contact with lost fishing gear. During a dive survey around Koh Tao, a small island in the Gulf of Thailand, the impact of lost fishing gear (nets, ropes, cages, lines) was studied on corals representing six different growth forms: branching, encrusting, foliaceous, free-living, laminar, and massive. Most gear (>95%) contained plastic. Besides absence of damage (<i>ND</i>), three categories of coral damage were assessed: fresh tissue loss (<i>FTL</i>), tissue loss with algal growth (<i>TLAG</i>), and fragmentation (<i>FR</i>). The position of the corals in relation to the fishing gear was recorded as either growing underneath (<i>Un</i>) or on top (<i>On</i>), whereas corals adjacent to the gear (<i>Ad</i>) were used as controls. Nets formed the dominant type of lost gear, followed by ropes, lines and cages, respectively. Branching corals were most commonly found in contact with the gear and also around it. <i>Tubastraea micranthus</i> was the most commonly encountered coral species, either <i>Un</i>, <i>On</i>, or <i>Ad</i>. Corals underneath gear showed most damage, which predominantly consisted of tissue loss. Fragmentation was less common than expected, which may be related to the low fragility of <i>T</i>. <i>micranthus</i> as dominant branching species.

The objective of this study was to explore whether these relationships could be used to explain variation in the transfer of radiocaesium to a wide range of marine organisms. CR data for <sup>137</sup>Cs were classified in relation to taxonomic family, order, class and phylum. A Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) mixed-model regression modelling approach was adopted. The existence of any patterns were then explored using phylogenetic trees constructed with mitochondrial COI gene sequences from various biota groups and mapping the REML residual means onto these trees. A comparison of the predictions made using REML with blind datasets allowed the efficacy of the procedure to be tested. The only significant correlation between predicted and measured activity concentrations was revealed at the taxonomic level of order when comparing REML analysis output with data from the Barents Sea Region. For this single case a correlation 0.80 (Spearman rank) was derived which was significant at the 0.01 level (1-tailed test) although this was not the case once a (Bonferroni) correction was applied. The application of the REML approach to marine datasets has met with limited success, and the phylogenetic trees illustrate complications of using predictions based on values from different levels of taxonomic organization, where predicted values for the order level can mask the values at lower taxonomic levels. Any influence of taxonomy and phylogeny on transfer is not immediately conspicuous and categorizing marine organisms in this way is limited in providing a potentially robust prognostic extrapolation tool. Other factors may plausibly affect transfer to a much greater degree in marine systems, such as quite diverse life histories and different diets, which may confound any phylogenetic pattern.","Brown, J.E.; Beresford, N.A.; Hevrøy, T.H.",WOS:000446076500087,"Hevrøy, T.H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.343,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Transfer; Cs-137; Concentration ratio; Residual Maximum Likelihood; Taxonomy; Phylogeny,Journal article,,,"CERAD Ctr Excellence Environm Radioact, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",Norway,Transfer; Cs-137; Concentration ratio; Residual Maximum Likelihood; Taxonomy; Phylogeny,INTER-TAXA DIFFERENCES; RADIONUCLIDE TRANSFER; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; CONCENTRATION RATIOS; COASTAL WATERS; ERICA TOOL; CS-137; BIOACCUMULATION; ORGANISMS; ELEMENTS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Centre for Environmental Radioactivity (CERAD),,Norway,,Research institute,Science

Callyspongia (C.) pedroi sp. nov. consists of pinkish delicate cylindrical microconulose branches (3–6 mm in diameter, 10–14 cm long) that rarely anastomose, with relatively large oval oscules (1–3 mm in diameter), and a skeleton dominated by primary and secondary fiber reticulations, discretely cored by fusiform oxeas. Callyspongia (C.) alcoladoi sp. nov. consists of grayish, smooth thin branches (3–8 mm in diameter, 20–30 cm long), profusely dividing and occasionally anastomosing, with few spiny projections (2–4 mm wide, 2–4 cm long). Its skeleton includes a highly developed ectosomal tertiary reticulation within the secondary and primary reticulation, and fibers discretely cored by predominant mucronate oxeas.

The mapping of these ecosystem services enhances the flow of information from researchers to practitioners, contributing to a better management of ecosystem services. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, a screening and evaluation of available open source spatial databases was conducted to assess their usefulness to map European coastal and marine ecosystem services. Second, these spatial databases were classified according to the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, Status, Impacts, Responses) framework and the MSFD descriptors to assess how this information can inform decision-makers. The supply of explicit spatial information was used as main screening criteria and allowed to identify 581 existing databases. These databases were then categorised according to a set of criteria (including data collection methods and updating frequency) related with their usefulness to be applied to map ecosystem services. The databases that did not meet the selected criteria (e.g. no explicit spatial information) were discarded. This process allowed to identify 329 spatial databases useful for coastal and marine ecosystem services mapping in Europe. The databases were then distinguished based on the ability to work the data on a GIS software, identifying 193 databases that allowed further analysis (hereafter applicable), and 136 databases that do not allow the extraction of data (hereafter non-applicable). The applicable spatial databases were further linked to the i) CICES framework for ecosystem services classification, ii) DPSIR framework and iii) descriptors considered in the MSFD. The obtained results showed that 42% of the spatial databases can be useful to map regulation services, followed by provision (33%) and cultural (21%) services. Considering the DPSIR framework, more than half can be used as proxies to evaluate coastal and marine ecosystems status (66%), followed by proxies of pressures (18%), drivers (8%), responses (4%), and finally impacts (4%). The available databases represent in a better way MSFD descriptors related to Hydrogeological conditions (D7), Eutrophication (D5), and Biodiversity (D1), being the non-indigenous species (D2) and contaminants in seafood (D9) descriptors somehow underrepresented. The obtained findings highlight the spatial open data limitations and challenges when mapping coastal and marine ecosystem services and contribute to the identification of spatial data gaps and opportunities when aiming for the sustainable management of marine ecosystems.","Caro, C.; Pinto, R.; Marques, J.C.",WOS:000456907400005,"Caro, Claudia, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.070,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Spatial databases; Data accessibility; Coastal and marine ecosystem services; Marine Strategy Framework Directive,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we systematically reviewed, categorized and geo-referenced information from >1780 publications about threats affecting 121 marine mammal species worldwide between 1991 and 2016. We created risk maps by assigning threat to countries where they had been reported, further refining spatial allocation to specific ocean basins and Longhurst biogeographical provinces and subsequent intersection with mapped species' distributions. We superimposed risk maps for different taxa and threats to visualize geographic patterns of risks and quantify risk severity with respect to number of species affected. Almost all marine mammal species have been reported to face at least one threat. Incidental catch affected the most species (112 species), followed by pollution (99 species), direct harvesting (89 species) and traffic-related impacts (86 species). Direct human activities, mainly fisheries, urban development, whaling/hunting and tourism were the major source of threats affecting most species (>60 species). Risk areas were identified for 51% of marine mammal core habitat. Besides, the majority of local marine mammal communities are at high-risk in 47% of world coastal-waters. Hotspots were located mainly in temperate and polar coastal waters and in enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean or Baltic Sea. However, risk areas differed by threat types and taxa. Our maps show that human activities in coastal waters worldwide impose previously unrecognized levels of cumulative risk for most of marine mammal species, and provide a spatially explicit frame of reference for the assessment of mammals' species conservation status.","Avila, I.C.; Kaschner, K.; Dormann, C.F.",WOS:000431837800006,"Dormann, Carsten, C.F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.02.021,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Marine mammals; Threats; Risk map; GIS; Global; Conservation,Journal article,,,"Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",Germany,Marine mammals; Threats; Risk map; GIS; Global; Conservation,HUMAN IMPACT; CONSERVATION; HOTSPOTS; MANAGEMENT; CETACEANS; DRIVERS; BYCATCH; HUMANS; LAND,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Freiburg - Faculty of Environmental & Natural Resources - Department of Biometry & Environmental System Analytics,x,Germany,,University,Science

An application of the method reveals how interplay between temperature and plankton dynamics during 1970-2009 impacted a cold-water species (Atlantic cod <i>Gadus morhua</i>) and a warm-water species (European anchovy <i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>) in the North Sea. Larval fish growth rates were estimated by coupling models depicting trait-based foraging and bioenergetics of individuals, spatiotemporal changes in their prey field, and the biogeochemistry and hydrodynamics of the region. The biomass composition of modeled prey fields varied from 89% nano-, 10% micro-, and 1% mesoplankton to 15% nano-, 20% micro-, and 65% mesoplankton. The mean slope of the normalized biomass size spectrum was near -1.2, consistent with theoretical and empirical estimates. Median larval fish growth rates peaked in June for cod (24% d<sup>-1</sup>) and in July for anchovy (17% d<sup>-1</sup>). Insufficient prey resources played a substantial role in limiting the growth rates of cod larvae. Anchovy were consistently limited by cold temperatures. Faster median larval growth during specific months was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) positively associated with detrended (i.e. higher than expected) juvenile recruitment indices in cod (rank correlation Kendall’s tau = 22%) and anchovy (tau = 42%). For cod, the most predictive month was February, which was also when food limitation was most prevalent. The continued development of modeling tools based on first principles can help further a mechanistic understanding of how changes in the environment affect the productivity of living marine resources.","Huebert, K.B.; Pätsch, J.; Hufnagl, M.; Kreus, M.; Peck, M.A.",WOS:000441331700009,"Huebert, Klaus, K.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12615,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,"Engraulis encrasicolus, ""Gadus morhua""",,,Fish larvae · Plankton · Model · Bottom-up processes · Prey availability · Growth · Recruitment · Cod · Anchovy · North Sea,Journal article,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.",USA,Fish larvae; Plankton; Model; Bottom-up processes; Prey availability; Growth; Recruitment; Cod; Anchovy; North Sea,INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELS; EARLY-LIFE HISTORY; GADUS-MORHUA; ATLANTIC COD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; SPAWNING STOCK; GERMAN BIGHT; PLANKTON; CARBON,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of Maryland,,USA,,University,Science

Oceans & Lakes, Interuniversity Master in Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management: Antwerpen, Gent and Brussel. 13 [Literature review] + 32 [Manuscript] pp.","Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used more and more often to track trends in harbour porpoise populations and to study the influences of man-made structures or management plans. PAM has various advantages over aerial surveys, such as its ability to gather information at night and in a continuous matter, while being less dependent on good weather conditions and offering a more cost-effective approach. However, up till now, only indications of relative abundance are available, because detection functions of individual C-POD devices are unknown and single organisms cannot be distinguished from one another based solely on their acoustic characteristics. This study combined the two techniques and showed that acoustic variables from C-POD echolocation recordings are strongly correlated with visual detections of harbour porpoises obtained through well-established line transect sampling techniques. Using this relationship, a regression model was established, based on the acoustic variable of detection positive hours, which explains about 61% in the variation of the dataset. With this model, absolute estimates can be derived from PAM data, if corrections are applied for the availability and perception bias. However, aerial surveys are still necessary, because the model is based on the robustness of the line sampling method used in these surveys and because they can cover the entire area of the BPNS in one survey. The regression model also needs further improvements to be representative for the entire BPNS, such as more data points and the use of only one mooring type, but it can already be used to fill in data gaps and observe finer trends in abundance and distribution. This study is a step between monitoring of harbour porpoise density solely based on line transect sampling and a fully operational passive acoustic network that can be used to obtain direct absolute density estimates.","Buyse, J.",,"Buyse, Jolien, J.","Oceans & Lakes, Interuniversity Master in Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management",,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Interuniversity Master in Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management (Oceans & Lakes),,Belgium,o,International programme,Science

Scattered across the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, these formerly colonized territories are subnational jurisdictions of France. Through examining their greenhouse gas emissions, their ecological importance, their economic conditions, as well as their policies, I argue that understanding the Outre-mer climate change perspectives demands an epistemic shift characterized by two theoretical gestures. Firstly, the Outre-mer perspectives require moving beyond the single geographical imaginary of France that only represents its European mainland. Contributing very little to France’s greenhouse gas emissions, these territories are particularly exposed and particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, making the case for a subnational climate justice. Secondly, beyond their portrayal as foreign and voiceless victims, the Outremer perspectives also recognize the presence of postcolonial subjects as political and historical actors facing climate change, calling forcefully for postcolonial equality and social justice.","Ferdinand, M.",WOS:000441359900008,"Ferdinand, Malcom, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.24043/isj.49,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"climate change, climate justice, France, Outre-mer, postcolonial politics, subnational island jurisdictions (SNIJs)",Journal article,,,"KITLV Royal Netherlands Inst Southeast Asian & Ca, Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,climate change; climate justice; France; Outre-mer; postcolonial politics; subnational island jurisdictions (SNIJs),,"Geography; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Geography; Social Sciences - Other Topics,KITLV Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies,x,Netherlands,,Research institute,Science

Harbour porpoises in the Belgian Part of the North Sea: Using passive acoustic monitoring to determine spatio-temporal patterns in distribution and feeding behaviour. MSc Thesis. Faculty of Sciences, Biology Department, Research Group Marine Biology: Gent.  47 pp.","Harbour porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) are the most common cetacean in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS). They are marine top predators and indicators for the health of an ecosystem. This makes them very important to study, yet there is no high resolution data available on the seasonal abundance and distribution patterns as well as the most important foraging zones for these animals in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS). The biggest reason for this is that they are hardly seen because they spend most of the time below the surface. Previous studies used aerial and ship-based surveys in order to learn more about their distribution. The problem with this is that no high resolution long-term data can be obtained due to the limitations of this type of study. It is not possible to obtain data during night, during wind speeds of more than 2 Beaufort, in foggy weather… Because porpoises have high energetic demands they echolocate almost continuously to navigate and forage. Therefore we can use Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) devices to study the seasonal distribution and feeding patterns by recording the sound characteristics of the porpoises. The devices used are C-PODs, which are basically hydrophones that are placed in the sea and record the characteristics of underwater sound. With nine different stations in the BPNS, our main goals were to obtain more knowledge of the seasonal presence and distribution patterns of harbour porpoises, determine where their main feeding hotspots are and see if there is a diel pattern in feeding behaviour. We observed a seasonal pattern with the least detections made in May and June, while the highest peak in detections was in January-February and a second and lower peak around September-October. Midshore has significantly higher detections than coastal areas and offshore areas had more detections than coastal areas, although not significant. The feeding ratio (encounters indicating feeding behaviour subdivided by the total amount of encounters) also seemed to have a seasonal pattern with the lowest ratios in August. We were able to show that significantly more feeding takes place in offshore areas compared to midshore areas. Both the seasonal patterns and the feeding ratio showed a diel pattern with significantly more detections during night-time than during daytime. Our results showed that the peak in seasonal presence is earlier than found in the previous research based on aerial surveys and PAM in the BPNS, and contradicts results from the SCANS-surveys that say there were only porpoises present in offshore areas in the summer. Due to a lack of overlapping data we couldn’t see patterns over years, but in the close future the PAM network in the BPNS will be updated with a new mooring type so that both the data and the data-availability will be increased. There will also become more stations in the under-sampled offshore north-western part of the North Sea, an area where a lot of porpoises are found during aerial surveys. This will hopefully help us to find long-term trends besides seasonal trends and help us to link the presence and behaviour to environmental factors.","Augustijns, T.",,"Augustijns, Tom, T.","Biology Department, Research Group Marine Biology, Ghent University",,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,Phocoena phocoena,"Echolocation, ""Ecology"", ""Feeding behaviour""",,Harbour porpoise; PAM; Temporal and Spatial distribution; C-POD; Belgian Part of the North Sea,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The extent of seagrass meadows in Southeast Asia is ~36,762.6 km<sup>2</sup> but this is likely an underestimate as some ecoregions were not well-represented and updated information was lacking. There is a paucity of information from the Western Coral Triangle Province, with no areal extent data available for the Indonesian regions of Kalimantan, Central and Southeast Sulawesi, the Maluku Islands, and West Papua. Regional research output has increased in the last two decades, with a trend towards more experimental, rather than descriptive research. However, there are knowledge gaps in socio-cultural-economic themed research, despite growing awareness of the importance of seagrass-human relationships in this region. Obstacles to advancing seagrass research, knowledge and conservation are rooted in either lack of expertise and training or the failure of effective management and policies. We propose a roadmap for seagrass conservation, with suggested solutions, including 1) encouraging collaboration between research institutions and scientists in the region to build capacity and share knowledge; 2) engaging with policymakers and governments to encourage science-based policies; 3) engaging with communities to raise awareness and foster stewardship of seagrass in the region.","Fortes, M.D.; Ooi, J.L.S.; Tan, Y.M.; Prathep, A.; Bujang, J.S.; Yaakub, S.M.",WOS:000433904000010,"Fortes, Miguel, M.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1515/bot-2018-0008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,conservation challenges; developing states; marine ecoregion; research gaps,Journal article,,,"DHI Water & Environm Singapore, Environm & Ecol Dept, 2 Venture Dr 18-18, Singapore 608526, Singapore.",Singapore,conservation challenges; developing states; marine ecoregion; research gaps,GENUS HALOPHILA THOUARS; TROPICAL SEAGRASS; GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT; MARINE ECOREGIONS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; ZOSTERA-NOLTII; BIODIVERSITY; COASTAL; MANAGEMENT; CARBON,Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,DHI Water Environment Health,x,Global,,Company,Industry

However, our phylogenetic hypotheses are not conclusive in regard to the relationships of the genera <i>Trypanedenta</i> and <i>Trypanobia</i>, nor to the status of those to genera as distinctive, since they seem to be paraphyletic and they appear in low-supported clades. In contrast, our results shed light on the evolution of the reproductive modes within the group, showing that scissiparity (development of a single stolon each time) is the ancestral character for the entire group and gemmiparity (development of more than one stolon at the same time) then appeared twice in two independent clades.","Álvarez-Campos, P.; Taboada, S.; San Martin, G.; Leiva, C.; Riesgo, A.",WOS:000424753100012,"Álvarez-Campos, Patricia, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1071/is17011,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Syllinae,,,"ancestral reconstruction, phylogeny, reproduction, ribbon clade, Syllinae, taxonomy",Journal article,,,"Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Zool, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",Spain,ancestral reconstruction; phylogeny; reproduction; ribbon clade; Syllinae; taxonomy,HAPLOSYLLIS POLYCHAETA; PHILIPPINES ISLANDS; HARTMANN-SCHRODER; TRYPANOSYLLIS; PHYLLODOCIDA; ASSOCIATIONS; BRAZIL; TAXA,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) - Department of Biological Zoology,x,Spain,,University,Science

It is based on a combination of data (and metadata), which present a snapshot of both natural and socio-economic elements of coastal and marine regions in the European Union and its Outermost Regions. The first idea of a European Atlas of the Seas was set forward in 2007 with the launch of the Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union. Early work on the Atlas was conducted by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs of the European Commission, while further development of system architecture, data collection, map services and descriptive text was assigned in 2013 to the Joint Research Centre, with the aim to offer new services and features, as well as the interaction with other available information tools. The present European Atlas of the Seas consists of background data layers designed to be displayed as map backdrop, as well as a number of thematic data layers, classified under 8 main categories: geography, nature, tourism, security and safety, people and employment, transport and energy, governance and European policies, fisheries and aquaculture. These can be used to compose customized maps, as user-defined <i>ad hoc</i> indicators, and to probe them with tools such as product-to-product correlations, or time series visualisation. Non-specialist professional users can use such analysis and interpretation capabilities to couple data into ecological and socio-economic indicators for a wide range of applications. The thematic map collection provided a common baseline that can be used by Member States of the European Union in getting started with the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive requirements. As this is seen as a pre-requisite for Blue Growth, the European Atlas of the Seas will help the sustainable use of marine ecosystem services and resources.","Barale, V.",WOS:000452576300002,"Barale, Vittorio, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.026,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Marine/maritime atlas; Coastal/marine information system; European Seas; Maritime spatial planning,Journal article,,,"European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Sustainable Resources, 7P 270,Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",Italy,Marine/maritime atlas; Coastal/marine information system; European Seas; Maritime spatial planning,,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,EU - European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Directorate Sustainable Resources,x,Europe,,Research institute,Science

All taxonomic groups have been considered for this analysis, taking into account established NIS in European Seas (824 taxa in total). The vast majority of the European marine NIS have their native distribution in the Western and Central Indo-Pacific, being mostly associated with introductions into the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. However, this overall pattern is heavily influenced by the fact that 76% of all NIS primary introductions in Europe have been reported first from the Mediterranean Sea. A more detailed analysis revealed various patterns of the dominating native distributions of the primarily introduced NIS in Europe, depending on the European marine subregions where they have been initially introduced and their associated pathways. There seems to be a general decrease in NIS introductions in Europe, especially when it comes to NIS with native distribution in the Temperate Northern Pacific, although this trend should be treated with caution.

Species distribution modelling was used to understand how harmful algal species may respond in the future to climate change, by considering environmental preferences and how these may shift. Most distribution studies to date use low resolution global model outputs. In this study, high resolution, downscaled shelf seas climate projections for the north-west European shelf were nested within lower resolution global projections, to understand how the distribution of harmful algae may change by the mid to end of century. Projections suggest that the habitat of most species (defined by temperature, salinity, depth, and stratification) will shift north this century, with suitability increasing in the central and northern North Sea.

In the Southern Ocean, <i>Aequiyoldia eightsii</i> (Jay, 1839) was originally described from the Antarctic Peninsula and has also been reported in southern South America. The species <i>A. woodwardi</i> (Hanley, 1960) was reported for the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and Tierra del Fuego, but this taxon has been recently synonymised within the broadly distributed <i>A. eightsii</i> . <i>Aequiyoldia</i> has received little attention across its distribution in the Southern Ocean, and although its taxonomy and systematics remain uncertain, all the species have been grouped under a single and broadly distributed unit: <i>A. eightsii</i> . Nevertheless, preliminary mtDNA comparisons demonstrated a marked genetic divergence (>7%) between <i>A. eightsii</i> populations from South America and Antarctic Peninsula. In order to further understand the diversity and biogeography of <i>Aequiyoldia</i> , we analyzed <i>A. eightsii</i> populations from different provinces of the Southern Ocean including South America (SA), the Falkland/Malvinas Islands (FI), the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), and Kerguelen Islands (KI). Individuals were characterized according to typical diagnostic morphological measurements and phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed based on mtDNA (cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit I). Patterns of genetic divergence of nucDNA intergenic transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) were also estimated. The statistical analysis of external diagnostic characteristics revealed two morphotypes: (1) individuals with the morphology recorded for the nominal FI species, <i>A. woodwardi</i> , and (2) individuals from SA, AP, and KI, with the morphology recorded for <i>A. eightsii</i> . However, phylogenetic reconstructions based on mtDNA and nucDNA suggest the presence of at least five lineages within <i>A. eightsii</i> including: one lineage in Kerguelen Island, two lineages in the Antarctic Peninsula, one lineage in South America, and the last one restricted to the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Such results are evidence that the Antarctic Polar Front represents an historical biogeographic barrier for this group and that after the separation of these lineages, they followed independent evolutionary pathways in different provinces of the Southern Ocean. Estimates of divergence time suggest that KI separated from other <i>Aequiyoldia</i> lineages close to the middle Miocene. Following this, the separation between the AP and SA lineages occurred at the end of the Miocene around 7.5 Ma. Finally, <i>Aequiyoldia</i> diversified during the Pliocene in Antarctic Peninsula (∼4.5 Ma) and South America (∼3.0 Ma). Individuals from FI exhibited morphological differences, and 4% of divergence from South American individuals, suggesting that <i>A. woordwardi</i> could be revalidated. Similarly, the marked molecular divergence between the KI and the rest of the recorded lineages also support the validity of <i>A. kerguelensis</i> (Thiele, 1931).","González-Wevar, C.A.; Gerard, K.; Rosenfeld, S.; Saucède, T.; Naretto, J.; Díaz, A.; Morley, S.A.; Brickle, P.; Poulin, E.",WOS:000471364200006,"Rosenfeld, Sebastian, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.09.004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biogeography, ""Phylogeny"", ""Systematics""",,Southern Ocean; Antarctic-Magellan Connection; Kerguelen Islands; Antarctic Peninsula; South America,Journal article,,,"Univ Magallanes, Inst Patagonia, Ave Bulnes 01890, Punta Arenas, Chile.",Chile,Biogeography; Southern Ocean; Antarctic-Magellan Connection; Kerguelen Islands; Antarctic Peninsula; South America; Morphometry; Systematics; Phylogeny,LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; MITOCHONDRIAL LINEAGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROMACHOCRINUS-KERGUELENSIS; ASTROTOMA-AGASSIZII; GENETIC-DIVERGENCE; FALKLAND-ISLANDS; GLACIAL REFUGIA; VICTORIA LAND; DNA,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Magallanes,,Chile,,University,Science

Our six-gene phylogenetic analysis reveals that the genera <i>Fenestrulina</i> and <i>Microporella</i> are each monophyletic, with the sister clade to <i>Microporella</i> comprising non-microporellids. Our result hence supports the reinstatement of the family Fenestrulinidae Jullien, 1888 for <i>Fenestrulina</i> and genera with comparable frontal shield and ooecial morphologies. Our well-supported phylogeny, based on independent molecular data, lends credit to existing phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological observations but does not conform to the current classification of these bryozoans.

In addition, the structure itself could alter currents and thereby influence the deposition and erosion of the sediments in the wake of the platform. This study aims to assess the long-term effects of a gas platform in the southern North Sea on the surrounding benthic community by both morphological and molecular identification of benthic species. The species composition and a set of abiotic factors of the sediment around a gas platform were assessed along four transects. Differences for the abiotic factors were found in the closer vicinity of the platform in the direction corresponding to the predominant currents. The number of benthic fauna families found in the molecular approach were on average three times higher than for the morphological approach.

Some species, particularly in the Atlantic, seem to be very rare, while others are abundant, widely distributed, and having large lists of synonyms. <i>Corambe obscura</i> (A. E. Verril, 1870) is one of these species that has been considered to have many synonyms, which conferred it a vast range of distribution. The recent re-capture and reinstatement of <i>Corambe carambola</i> (Marcus, 1955) meant a severe restriction of the distribution of <i>C. obscura</i> and a reminder that a lot of questions are still to be answered regarding the Atlantic species of the genus. In this work, a rare species of <i>Corambe</i> Bergh, 1869 is described using a single specimen from Guadeloupe, Caribbean Sea. <i>Corambe osculabundus</i> Ortea & Caballer sp. nov. was collected during the expedition KARUBENTHOS coordinated by the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, in Paris. It is characterized by a pattern of red lipstick-shaped stains that cover the mantle, hemispherical spiculous tubercles, a posterior notch on the mantle, rhinophores with anterolateral expansions, a dorsal buccal pump, 14 gill leafs (central gill leaf absent), and a radular formula 42 × 1.1-2P.2.1.0.1.2.1-2P.1., with one or two smooth plates interspersed before the outermost lateral teeth.

An updated model for estimating the TMDL-related benefits of oyster reef restoration: A final report to: The Nature Conservancy and Oyster Recovery Partnership. Virginia Institute of Marine Science/University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Science: Harris Creek.  67 pp.","In 2014, a user-friendly, web-accessible model was developed that allowed restoration practitioners and resource managers to easily estimate the TMDLrelated benefits of oyster reef (Crassostrea virginica) restoration per unit area, run restoration scenarios in Harris Creek, MD to optimize restoration planning and implementation, and calculate the benefits of the chosen plan. The model was rooted in scientifically defensible data and was readily transferrable to systems throughout the Chesapeake Bay and Eastern Shore. The model operated in five vertically well-mixed boxes along the main axis of the creek. Exchanges among creeks were computed using a tidal prism approach and were compared to exchanges provided from a high resolution 3D hydrodynamic model. Watershed inputs for the model were obtained for the Harris Creek sub-watershed from the Phase V Chesapeake Bay Program Watershed Model. The base model simulated daily concentrations over an annual cycle of chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, the biomass of benthic microalgae, and the water column and sediment pools of labile organic carbon (C) and associated N and P. Water quality data for model forcing and calibration were obtained from the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Choptank Riverkeeper, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. An oyster sub-model was coupled to this base model to compute the volume of water filtered, removal of phytoplankton, suspended solids, and associated nutrients via filtration, recycling of nutrients and consumption of oxygen by oyster respiration, production of feces, N and P accumulation in oyster tissues and shell, oyster-enhanced denitrification, and N and P burial associated with restored reefs. The completed model was served online and operated through a web browser, enabling users to conduct scenario analysis by entering box-specific values for acres restored, restored oyster density, and restored oyster size, as well as the economic value of associated N and P removal. The updated model incorporates all aspects of the previous model but replaces oyster related data collected outside Harris Creek with site-specific data, and now includes restored oyster populations and water quality data through 2016. It also incorporates the impacts of two common, reef-associated filter feeding organisms: the hooked mussel Ischadium recurvum and the sea squirt Molgula manhattensis. Additional data collected in Harris Creek and incorporated into the model include: biomass of benthic microalgae, biogeochemical fluxes in relation to oyster biomass, and the biomass density and distribution of the dominant non-oyster reef filter feeders (I. recurvum, and M. manhattensis). The revised model incorporates an improved estimate of annual oyster growth, uses an improved method for estimating N and P sequestered in tissues and shells, and accounts for the prerestoration oyster population in Harris Creek. The model also incorporates data on the filtration capacity of <i>I. recurvum</i> and <i>M. manhattensis</i> in relation to <i>C. virginica</i> collected as part of a previous study (not in Harris Creek) by Kellogg and Newell (unpublished data).","Kellog, M.L.; Brush, M.J.; Cornwell, J.C.",,"Cornwell, Jeffrey, J.C.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Europe, this community lacks a formal network structure. The aim of this study is to review the use of acoustic telemetry in Europe and document the contribution of cross-boundary studies and inter-research group collaborations. Based on this, we explore the potential benefits and challenges of a network approach to identify future priorities and best practices for aquatic biotelemetry research in Europe.Results: Over the past decade, there was an approximately sevenfold increase in the number of acoustic telemetry studies published on marine and diadromous species in Europe compared to a sixfold increase globally. Over 90% of these studies were conducted on fishes and undertaken in coastal areas, estuaries, or rivers. 75% of these studies were conducted by researchers based in one of five nations (Norway, UK, France, Portugal, and Spain) and, even though 34% were based on collaborations between scientists from several countries, there was only one study with an acoustic receiver array that extended beyond the borders of a single country. In recent years, acoustic telemetry in European waters has evolved from studying behavioural aspects of animals (82.2%), into more holistic approaches addressing management-related issues (10%), tagging methods and effects (5%), and technology and data analysis development (2.8%).Conclusions: Despite the increasing number of publications and species tracked, there is a prominent lack of planned and structured acoustic telemetry collaborations in Europe. A formal pan-European network structure would promote the development of (1) a research platform that could benefit the acoustic telemetry community through capacity building, (2) a centralized database, and (3) key deployment sites and studies on priority species requiring research in Europe. A network may increase efficiency, expand the scope of research that can be undertaken, promote European science integration, enhance the opportunities and success of acquiring research funding and, ultimately, foster regional and transatlantic collaborations. It may also help address research priorities such as the large-scale societal challenges arising from climate change impacts and assist the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive via identification of good environmental status of endangered or commercially important species.","Abecasis, D.; Steckenreuter, A.; Reubens, J.; Aarestrup, K.; Alós, J.; Badalamenti, F.; Bajona, L.; Boylan, P.; Deneudt, K.; Greenberg, L.; Brevé, N.; Hernandez, F.; Humphries, N.; Meyer, C.; Sims, D.W.; Thorstad, E.B.; Walker, A.M.; Whoriskey, F.; Afonso, P.",,"Steckenreuter, Andre, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40317-018-0156-0,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,European tracking network; Acoustic telemetry; Flagship species; Acoustic arrays; Animal movement; Spatio-temporal movement; Biotelemetry,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such monitoring programs are based on a systematically selected set of survey locations that, while able to track trends at those locations through time, lack inference for the overall region being “monitored”. Advances in spatially-balanced sampling approaches offer alternatives but remain largely untested in marine ecosystems. This study evaluated the merit of using a two-stage, spatially-balanced survey framework, in conjunction with generalized additive models, to estimate epifauna cover at a reef-wide scale for mesophotic reefs within a large, cross-shelf marine park. Imagery acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle was classified using a hierarchical scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI). At a realistic image subsampling intensity, the two-stage, spatially-balanced framework provided accurate and precise estimates of reef-wide cover for a select number of epifaunal classes at the coarsest CATAMI levels, in particular bryozoan and porifera classes. However, at finer hierarchical levels, accuracy and/or precision of cover estimates declined, primarily because of the natural rarity of even the most common of these classes/morphospecies. Ranked predictor importance suggested that bathymetry, backscatter and derivative terrain variables calculated at their smallest analysis window scales (i.e. 81 m2) were generally the most important variables in the modeling of reef-wide cover. This study makes an important step in identifying the constraints and limitations that can be identified through a robust statistical approach to design and analysis. The two-stage, spatially-balanced framework has great potential for effective quantification of epifaunal cover in cross-shelf mesophotic reefs. However, greater image subsampling intensity than traditionally applied is required to ensure adequate observations for finer-level CATAMI classes and associated morphospecies.","Monk, J.; Barrett, N.S.; Peel, D.; Lawrence, E.; Hill, N.A.; Lucieer, V.; Hayes, K.R.",WOS:000444918300024,"Monk, Jacquomo, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0203827,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Australia,,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SAMPLE-SIZE; NATURAL-RESOURCES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; DISTRIBUTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS; ABUNDANCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Tasmania - Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS),x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

Our extensive literature survey and revisions resulted in the exclusion of 61 species, which were included in previous lists, and the addition of 41 new alien species reported in the 2016–2018 period plus ten old NIS records. The current number of introduced species in Greek waters whose presence is not questionable includes 214 alien species and 62 cryptogenic species. Approximately 80% of the introduced species in Greek Seas consists of the taxa—in decreasing order—Mollusca, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Fishes, and Macroalgae. Nevertheless, a considerable increase in the number of NIS Bryozoa and Ascidiacea was observed within the last decade. Unaided natural dispersal of Lessepsian immigrants (57%) and transport-stowaways (36.7%) are the major pathways of introduction reported for Greek waters. However, with few exceptions (6.8% of species), the confidence level in assigning a pathway was medium to low. Several species reported from adjacent marine areas are expected to reach Greek waters within the next years. The intensification of underwater observations by citizen scientists combined with further research in hot spot areas, understudied habitats and overlooked taxa will significantly raise the number of NIS species in Greek waters.

It is an abundant mollusc in some aquatic environment in South Africa. In this study, we investigated the potential of the molluscs harvested from the Buffalo, Swartkops, and Kowie estuaries in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa to serve as transient or maintenance reservoir of <i>Vibrio</i>) species. The mollusc and source water samples were collected monthly from the rivers between December 2016 and November 2017. The reservoir category of the limpet samples recovered was determined by employing the combination of MPN-PCR method and statistical analysis (comparison of mean and proportion tests). The densities of <i>Vibrio</i>) spp. in limpet and their source water samples were determined using MPN-PCR methods. Presumptive isolates were recovered by processing the samples with thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar and where necessary, samples were enriched with alkaline peptone water. The presumptive isolates were identified using PCR methods with emphasis on six <i>Vibrio</i>) species of public health importance. <i>Vibrio</i>) spp. were detected in all the limpet samples but not in all the water samples. The densities of <i>Vibrio</i>) spp. in the limpet samples were more than the densities of <i>Vibrio</i>) species in their source water and these were significant at <i>P</i>) &#x0003c; 0.05. In like manner, five out of the six key <i>Vibrio</i>) pathogens targeted in this study were more prevalent in limpet samples than in source water samples. Based on our findings, we concluded that our method though could be improved on, is efficient for the determination of reservoir types of bacterial-carrying organisms. We also concluded that the limpet found in the estuaries are not just a transient but a maintenance reservoir of <i>Vibrio</i>) spp. which could cause vibrio-related infections.","Abioye, O.E.; Okoh, A.I.",WOS:000443512700001,"Abioye, Oluwatayo, O.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00237,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Vibrio,,,public-health; MPN-PCR; reservoir types;  Vibrio species; limpet; prevalence; transient reservior; maintanance reservoir,Journal article,,,"Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Microbiol, Ife, Nigeria.",Nigeria,public-health; MPN-PCR; reservoir types; Vibrio species; limpet; prevalence; transient reservior; maintanance reservoir,HSP60 GENE-SEQUENCES; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL STRAINS; HALOPHILIC BACTERIA; VIRULENCE GENES; WASTE-WATER; PARAHAEMOLYTICUS; PCR; IDENTIFICATION; CHOLERAE,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Obafemi Awolowo University,,Nigeria,,University,Science

Carte paléontologique de Madagascar: inventaire et mise en valeur du patrimoine paléontologique. PhD Thesis. Université de Toulouse/Université de Mahajanga: Toulouse, Mahajanga.  488 pp.","Madagascar has been isolated from Gondwana during the Mesozoic : she separated from the African continent, ca. 180 Ma, and from the indian subcontinent, ca 150 Ma. Since then, biological evolution followed its own rythm, what Philibert COMMERSON had yet foreseen in 1771, writing that Madagascar was the ""laboratory of nature"" and that ""Madagascar was the true land of promise for naturalists"". After almost two hundred years of paleontological researches, it is time for a mapped balance sheet of Madagascar : it is the subject of this thesis. The literature on Madagascar is extremely abundant, and we brought together more than 2000 publications, printed between 1829 and 2014, in relation to the paleontology of the Island. They allowed to identify nearly 3500 fossil species, 3% of Plants (104 taxa), 89% of ""Invertebrates"" (231 Foraminifera, 183 Cnidarians, 14 Bryozoans, 56 Brachiopods, 6 Annelids, 392 Bivalves, 206 Gasteropods, 1746 Cephalopods, 129 Crustaceans, 60 terrestrial Arthropods and 85 Echinoderms) and 8% of Vertebrates (76 ""Fishes"", 7 Amphibians, 29 ""Reptiles"", 24 non avian Archosauromorphs, 52 Birds and 82 Mammals). These taxa are distributed in over 400 paleontological sites from the upper Paleozoïc (Permian) to the Quaternary (Holocen), distributed as follows : twenty Permian sites, 24 Triassic, over 110 Jurassic, over 130 Cretaceous, 16 Tertiary et 42 Quaternary sites. Some taxonomic groups are over-represented (eg ammonites), while others should promise new discoveries (archosaurs, mammals!…). The periods themselves have a different focus (Mesozoic vs. Cenozoic) and in the same vein, the paleontological sites are unevenly distributed in the territory (the Northwest is the most explored). The research potential is still very high. Fossils and paleontological sites are placed in a map database with comments. Thus we have achieved, at least we hope, an useful basic tool for scientists, also a ""global"" book for teachers and naturalists, and a support to reflection and decision for Madagascar administrators and politicians at both regional and national levels.","Rakotovao Andrianavah, M.",,"Rakotovao Andrianavah, Marius, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Madagascar; Geology; Paleontology; Heritage; Inventory,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

MoVIB reversed pain behavior in a rat neuropathic pain model, confirming that vermivorous cone snails are a new source of analgesic ω-conotoxins.

On account of the final suffix, the gender of the name Talitriator is masculine. Under Articles 31.2 and 34.2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature [hereafter “the Code”] (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 1999), a Latin adjective that is used as a species-group name must agree in gender with the generic name it is combined with.

Protecting areas of conservation importance may serve as a proxy for maintaining these functions, while also facilitating efficient use and management of limited resources. Biodiversity hotspots have been used as surrogates for spatial conservation importance; however, as many protected areas have been established opportunistically and under differing criteria, it is unclear how well they actually protect hotspots. We evaluated how well the current protected area network and priority areas selected through previous systematic conservation planning exercises preserve biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We also determined spatial congruence between biodiversity hotspots based on different criteria, which may determine their ability to be used as surrogates for each other. We focus on the Gulf of California because it is a megadiverse system where limited information regarding species diversity and distribution has constrained development of strategies for conservation and management. We developed a species occurrence database and identified biodiversity hotspots using four different criteria: species richness, rarity, endemism, and threatened species. We interpolated species occurrence, while accounting for heterogeneous sampling efforts. We then assessed overlap of hotspots with existing protected areas and priority areas, and between hotspots derived by distinct criteria. We gathered 286,533 occurrence records belonging to 12,105 unique species, including 6388 species identified as rare, 642 as endemic, and 386 as threatened. We found that biodiversity hotspots showed little spatial overlap with areas currently under protection and previously identified priority areas. Our results highlight the importance of distinct spatial areas of biodiversity and suggest that different ecological mechanisms sustain different aspects of diversity and multiple criteria should be used when defining conservation areas.","Morzaria-Luna, H.N.; Cruz-Piñon, G.; Brusca, R.C.; López-Ortiz, A.M.; Moreno-Báez, M.; Reyes-Bonilla, H.; Turk-Boyer, P.",WOS:000449112700015,"Morzaria-Luna, Hem Nalini, H.N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10531-018-1631-x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Marine Spatial Planning; Species richness; Rarity; Endemism; Threatened species,Journal article,,,"NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",USA,Marine Spatial Planning; Species richness; Rarity; Endemism; Threatened species,MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; RESERVE NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; REEF; FISHES; STRATEGIES; MODEL; SUSTAINABILITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NOAA National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration,,USA,,Governmental body,Policy

Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a process that aims to organize the use of the ocean space, as well as the interactions among human uses (e.g., fisheries, aquaculture, shipping, tourism, renewable energy production) and between users and the marine environment. Over the past 30 years, significant progress has been made by governments in their thinking about MSP. The MSP is currently under development in over 66 countries (44% of the nations with marine waters), encompassing six continents and four ocean basins, and the interest in MSP continues to grow. While most countries are still in the early phase of their MSP initiatives, others have already approved, implemented, or even revised marine spatial plans for many years. Despite its acceptance and use, development and implementation of MSP still faces several conceptual and practical challenges, from political to institutional, social, economic, scientific, and environmental sources. The present chapter provides a review on all these topics by addressing three main questions: what is MSP and why is it needed; what is the global distribution of MSP around the world, together with its state of development by region; and what are some of the most prominent and widespread challenges, present and future, that are linked to the development of MSP?","Frazão Santos, C.; Ehler, C.N.; Agardy, T.; Andrade, F.; Orbach, M.K.; Crowder, L.B.",,"Crowder, Larry, L.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-805052-1.00033-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Marine/maritime spatial planning; Ocean planning; Global status; Main challenges,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taxonomy is the part of the science of systematics that deals with identifying, describing, and categorizing organisms from species to higher taxa. Nomenclature is a system of giving names to organisms based on rules established for the process. Adoption of a system of binomial nomenclature by end of the 18th century helped standardize the process of naming the wealth of new organisms collected during the Age of Exploration, but before the middle of the 19th century, the turmoil resulting from differences in procedures and philosophies among practicing taxonomists necessitated the development of codes of nomenclature to regulate naming. By the early 20th century, codified sets of rules for the names of both plants and animals, nowadays usually abbreviated as International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Botanical Code) and ICZN (Zoological Code), were in place internationally. These codes worked reasonably well through most of the 20th century, under the aegis of various international bodies, in part because procedures exist to bypass them when their provisions threaten nomenclatural stability. They also inspired the development of other nomenclatural codes for specific groups of organisms like bacteria, and, alternatively, the proposal of unified codes for all organisms. The rapid development of electronic communications and various means of electronic publication at the end of the 20th century, combined with what may be the advent of a new age of biological extinction, resulted in pressure to revise the codes to allow at least some degree of electronic publication and speedier description of new taxa in the 21st century. Consistent and unambiguous names are the platforms on which biological research and conservation practices are built. As we pursue the goals of documenting and conserving biodiversity, for which a stable nomenclature is essential, we must do so without restricting the freedom of the science of systematics.","Winston, J.E.",WOS:000456584300010,"Winston, Judith, J.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icb/icy060,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Smithsonian Marine Stn, 701 Seaway Dr, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA.",USA,,CULTIVATED-PLANTS; TAXONOMY; HISTORY; CODE,Zoology,Zoology,Smithsonian Institution - Smithsonian Marine Station,x,USA,,Research institute,Science

There are many challenges associated with aggregating, validating, storing, querying, analyzing, and sharing information, as the amount of data and information increases nearly as fast as the advancements in computer hardware and processing power. In order to determine the types of data that are collected and shared, where and how those data are shared, which information systems are being accessed, and what information is being used from the information systems, a survey was sent out to representatives from federal agencies that are associated with invasive species programs. The respondents’ results and recommendations are summarized. Most agencies collected data that are relevant to their programs, research, and management needs, and they share data either through their own portals or directly with those who request it. The respondents all recommended that support needs to increase for invasive species programs so that data collection can spread to more areas of interest and towards prevention and proactive programs.

On average, over the 20 nights and all sites, 389 birds passed per 1 km transect per hour. The night with highest migration intensity showed an average of 1 621 birds per km per hour passing the radar stations, but there was considerable geographical and temporal variation in migration intensity. The highest intensity of migration was seen in central France. The overall migration directions showed strong southwest components. Migration dynamics were strongly related to synoptic wind conditions. A wind‐related mass migration event occurred immediately after a change in wind conditions, but quickly diminished even when supporting winds continued to prevail.

Known for their ability to secrete sulfuric acid, they use it to prey on a diversity of invertebrates, primarily echinoderms. Tonnoideans currently are classified in seven accepted families: the comparatively well known, shallow water Bursidae, Cassidae, Personidae, Ranellidae, and Tonnidae, and the lesser-known, deep water Laubierinidae and Pisanianuridae. We assembled a mitochondrial and nuclear gene (COI, 16S, 12S, 28S) dataset for ∼80 species and 38 genera currently recognized as valid. Bayesian analysis of the concatenated dataset recovered a monophyletic Tonnoidea, with <i>Ficus</i> as its sister group. Unexpectedly, <i>Thalassocyon</i>, currently classified in the Ficidae, was nested within the ingroup as the sister group to <i>Distorsionella</i>. Among currently recognized families, Tonnidae, Cassidae, Bursidae and Personidae were supported as monophyletic but the Ranellidae and Ranellinae were not, with Cymatiinae, <i>Ranella</i> and <i>Charonia</i> supported as three unrelated clades. The Laubierinidae and Pisanianuridae together form a monophyletic group. Although not all currently accepted genera have been included in the analysis, the new phylogeny is sufficiently robust and stable to the inclusion/exclusion of nonconserved regions to establish a revised family-level classification with nine families: Bursidae, Cassidae, Charoniidae, Cymatiidae, Laubierinidae, Personidae, Ranellidae, Thalassocyonidae and Tonnidae. The results reveal that many genera as presently circumscribed are para- or polyphyletic and, in some cases support the rescue of several genus-group names from synonymy (<i>Austrosassia, Austrotriton, Laminilabrum</i>, <i>Lampadopsis</i>, <i>Personella</i>, <i>Proxicharonia</i>, <i>Tritonoranella</i>) or conversely, support their synonymization (<i>Biplex</i> with <i>Gyrineum</i>).

Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and <sup>32</sup>P radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency.","Cozzoli, F; Ligetta, G.; Vignes, F.; Basset, A.",WOS:000445907400050,"Basset, Alberto, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0204448,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy.",Italy,,GIVING-UP DENSITIES; BODY-SIZE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; ASSESSMENT ABILITIES; HABITAT SELECTION; METABOLIC THEORY; TEMPERATURE; COEXISTENCE; PREDATION; GROWTH,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Salento - Department of Biological & Environmental Science & Technology - Ecology Lab,x,,,,

Chapter  3 focuses on the central significance of the intestinal microbiota, the forgotten ecosystem. Central in Chap.  4 is the message that dietary restriction and starvation are natural occurrences and do not necessarily kill the individuals which often respond with compensatory growth and improved Darwinian fitness – even of their offspring. Chapter  5 discusses the circadian rhythmicity of digestive and biotransformation gene transcription and questions the paradigm of ‘antinutritional factors’.

Although morphological systematics of the genus have been documented over the past century, characterization of molecular taxonomy has been attempted only recently. In the present study, we sequenced an 8,167 bp region, encompassing a single ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat unit, from <i>Chrysaora pacifica</i>, and used it for phylogenetic analyses. The tandemly repeated rDNA units turned out to consist of both coding and noncoding regions, whose arrangement was found to be the same as that of a typical eukaryote. None of the 5S rRNA sequences were found among the repeat units. Comparative analyses of jellyfish rDNA sequences showed that the 28S locus is highly informative and divergent compared to the 18S locus. Phylogenetic analyses of the 18S and 28S loci revealed that the Semaeostomeae order of jellyfish is separated into taxonomic groups by families and genera, with a few exceptions. The family Pelagiidae was in a clade separate from other groups, thus forming a monophyletic lineage. All <i>Chrysaora</i> included here formed a strongly supported clade within the family Pelagiidae, and Pelagiidae manifested a sister relationship with Cyanea. Nonetheless, <i>Chrysaora</i> was found to be paraphyletic in both 18S and 28S phylogenies.

A climate‐driven southward shift of the ACC and its frontal systems, the SAF and APF, in the vicinity of the PEIs is associated with a long‐term decline in the frequency of island‐associated phytoplankton blooms. These oceanographic perturbations coincide with significant declines in top predator populations attributed to shifts in the distribution and availability of prey, illustrating the interconnectedness between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the PEIs. This study investigated the influence of oceanographic variability on the marine ecosystem of the PEIs. A shift in phytoplankton and bacterial communities was observed that coincides with the position of the southern branch of the SAF, which was located to the north of the PEIs during 2014 and to the south during 2012, 2013, and 2015. These shifts in the diversity and structure of marine microbial communities correlate with significant perturbations in the position of the SAF relative to the islands leading us to conlclude that bacterial and phytoplankton communities in the PEI region are strongly influenced by shifts in the position of the SAF relative to the PEIs.

This work highlights the importance to take chronobiology into account in experimental marine biology to avoid faulty results, misinterpretation of results, and/or to strengthen observations and conclusion. A literature survey, based on 150 articles, was conducted and showed that, despite the pervasive imprint of biological rhythms in marine species, environmental cycles such as the 24 h-light/dark cycle and the seasonality are rarely considered in experimental designs.

These habitats are widespread but are threatened by increasing pressure from anthropo - genic activities. Greater knowledge of the consequences of biodiversity loss for the functioning of ecosystems can aid management, by identifying potential threats. Systematic searches of the Web of Science and SCOPUS identified 163 published datasets of essentially ‘pristine’ mudflat macrofaunal assemblages, comprising data on 448 taxa from 4 climatic zones and 10 biogeographic regions. Broad-scale patterns of trait distribution confirmed established patterns showing that taxa at low latitudes have smaller body sizes, shorter life spans and more taxa have exoskeletons, and that direct developmental modes are more prevalent at high latitudes. Greater occurrences of burrow dwellers in the temperate zone may support greater rates of sediment turnover, organic matter de com position and nutrient cycling, whereas in the tropics, tube dwellers provide more biogenic habitat. Despite these trait differences, the overall similarity in trait composition relative to taxonomic composition indicated that globally, mudflats are functionally similar. The functional redundancy observed across regional and climatic boundaries suggests that ecosystem functioning and service delivery will show some resilience in the face of perturbation. However, the growing anthropogenic pressures on coastal mudflats means the risk of system collapse, beyond resilience thresholds, is high. This study illustrates how an extensive body of published literature can provide a foundation for developing a global understanding of ecological functioning in mudflats to inform management responses.","Dissanayake, N.G.; Frid, C.L.J.; Drylie, T.P.; Caswell, B.A.",WOS:000446470100001,"Dissanayake, Navodha, N.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12728,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Functional redundancy; Biodiversity; Biogeographic trends; Biological traits; Latitudinal variations; Resilience; Environmental management,Journal article,,,"Univ Hull, Sch Environm Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",England,Functional redundancy; Biodiversity; Biogeographic trends; Biological traits; Latitudinal variations; Resilience; Environmental management,SPECIES RICHNESS PATTERNS; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; LATITUDINAL VARIATION; DIVERSITY PATTERNS; FRESH-WATER; MARINE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT; BIOTURBATION,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of Hull,,UK,,University,Science

Here, we used phylogenetic approaches to address the causes of richness patterns among global marine regions, comparing the relative importance of colonization time, number of colonization events, and diversification rates (speciation minus extinction). We estimated regional richness using distributional data for almost all percomorph fishes (17 435 species total, including approximately 72% of all marine fishes and approximately 33% of all freshwater fishes). The high diversity of the Central Indo-Pacific was explained by its colonization by many lineages 5.3–34 million years ago. These relatively old colonizations allowed more time for richness to build up through in situ diversification compared to other warm-marine regions. Surprisingly, diversification rates were decoupled from marine richness patterns, with clades in low-richness cold-marine habitats having the highest rates. Unlike marine richness, freshwater diversity was largely derived from a few ancient colonizations, coupled with high diversification rates. Our results are congruent with the geological history of the marine tropics, and thus may apply to many other organisms. Beyond marine biogeography, we add to the growing number of cases where colonization and time-for-speciation explain large-scale richness patterns instead of diversification rates.","Miller, E.C.; Hayashi, K.T.; Song, D.; Wiens, J.A.",WOS:000446864300006,"Wiens, John, J.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rspb.2018.1314,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Pisces,,,marine biodiversity; fish; time-for-speciation; diversification; freshwater; historical biogeography,Journal article,,,"Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",USA,marine biodiversity; fish; time-for-speciation; diversification; freshwater; historical biogeography,GEOGRAPHIC RANGE EVOLUTION; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; REEF FISHES; DIVERSIFICATION; EXTINCTION; SPECIATION; ORIGINS; TIME,Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,University of Arizona,x,USA,,University,Science

University of Exeter: Exeter.  303 pp.","This thesis comprises an empirical case study of scientific data production in oceanography and a philosophical analysis of the relations between newly created scientific data and the natural world. Based on qualitative interviews with researchers, I reconstruct research practices that lead to the ongoing production of digital data related to long-term developments of plankton biodiversity in the oceans. My analysis is centred on four themes: materiality, scientific representing with data, methodological continuity, and the contribution of non-scientists to epistemic processes. These are critically assessed against the background of today’s data-intensive sciences and increased automation and remoteness in oceanographic practices. Sciences of the world’s oceans have by and large been disregarded in philosophical scholarship thus far. My thesis opens this field for philosophical analysis and reveals various conditions and constraints of data practices that are largely uncontrollable by ocean scientists. I argue that the creation of useful scientific data depends on the implementation and preservation of material, methodological, and social continuities. These allow scientists to repeatedly transform visually perceived characteristics of research samples into meaningful scientific data stored in a digital database. In my case study, data are not collected but result from active intervention and subsequent manipulation and processing of newly created material objects. My discussion of scientific representing with data suggests that scientists do not extract or read any intrinsic representational relation between data and a target, but make data gradually more computable and compatible with already existing representations of natural systems. My arguments shed light on the epistemological significance of materiality, on limiting factors of scientific agency, and on an inevitable balance between changing conditions of concrete research settings and long-term consistency of data practices.","Halfmann, G.",,"Halfmann, Gregor, G.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative importance of the guild within the macrobenthic assemblage as a whole was spatially uniform but its abundance was significantly patchy at all spatial scales—a few stations supporting up to 170 times background levels of some species—and guild patchiness showed a relatively constant magnitude across those scales. Patches of individual species were independently distributed, showing no evidence of negative inter-specific interactions, the few significant spatial correlations between species being very weak and positive. Levels of syntopy (up to six species within a 0.0054 m2 area) did not differ from those expected under null models of independent assortment.

Since 2009, fifteen coastal countries in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans have opted to ban commercial shark fishing altogether, and have laws that prohibit the possession, trade or sale of sharks and shark products. These ‘shark sanctuaries’ collectively cover>3% of the world’s oceans, a similar coverage as all currently established marine protected areas combined. Despite their prominence, and an intense scientific debate about their usefulness, the condition of shark sanctuaries has not yet been empirically evaluated. Here, we report results from a global diver survey used to set baselines of shark populations, human use patterns, public awareness and threats in all 15 shark sanctuaries, and contrasted with observations from 23 non-sanctuary countries. Specific results varied by country, but there were some general trends: i) shark sanctuaries showed less pronounced shark population declines, fewer observations of sharks being sold on markets, and lower overall fishing threats compared to nonshark sanctuaries, ii) bycatch, ghost gear, marine debris and habitat destruction are significant threats that are often not addressed by sanctuary regulations and need to be resolved in other ways, and iii) participants in sanctuaries were more optimistic about the survival of shark populations in local waters, but also highlighted the need for further conservation efforts. These results suggest that shark sanctuaries, as seen through the lens of local experts, may be a helpful conservation tool but likely not sufficient in isolation. There is an urgent need for higher-resolution data on shark abundance, incidental catch, and markets to direct priority conservation needs and optimize the conservation benefits of existing and future shark sanctuaries.","Ward-Paige, C.A.; Worm, B.",WOS:000418392300017,"Ward-Paige, Christine, C.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.09.005,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Fisheries,,Protected areas; Fisheries; Shark conservation; Bycatch; Ghost gear; Marine debris; Citizen science   ,Journal article,,,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",Canada,Protected areas; Fisheries; Shark conservation; Bycatch; Ghost gear; Marine debris; Citizen science,NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS; ECONOMIC VALUE; CONSERVATION; HIDE,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,Dalhousie University - Department of Biology,x,,,,

An interdisciplinary oceanographic sampling strategy allowed us to solve mesoscale processes including current–bathymetry interactions. Subsurface fertilizing processes and elevated chlorophyll a concentrations were found at the front, seamount, and submarine canyons, turning an apparently oligotrophic area into a rich one. According to a horizontal tracking simulation, the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at the front is located above the pycnocline and travels fast offshore, transporting productivity from the fertilization process quickly from the region. The DCM at the seamount, in contrast, develops below the pycnocline and remains for almost three weeks in this area. In spite of the coastal marine protected areas (MPAs), a high surface nitrate concentration plume with its origin in a small coastal area without any protection was detected. Local circulation patterns and bathymetry–current interactions provide elevated productivity in surface water which is vertically connected to deep-sea fauna via the daily vertical migration of zooplankton, suggesting elevated biodiversity on the seamount and canyons of the area studied.

This is important in a world where species are lost at an alarming rate. Animal species can be identified during biomonitoring with various methods. One of these is metabarcoding which uses genetic markers isolated from a DNA extract from the biological community under study. These can then be sequenced with one of the many available platforms. Recently, the British company Oxford Nanopore Technologies has developed a revolutionary technology (MinION) has made sequencing much more accessible. In this research, it was investigated whether it is possible to use this MinION sequencer for metabarcoding of marine zooplankton communities. Each step of the protocol was optimised, after which it was applied to samples taken during a biomonitoring campaign on the North Sea. Different DNA extraction techniques are tested, after which PCR amplification and purification are optimized by selection of an optimal primer set, PCR master mix, inhibition prevention measures and purification protocols. The amplicons were then sequenced and subdivided into species using a reference database. Finally, a comparison was made with a ZooScan analysis in which species are determined based on their morphology. The results largely conform to ZooScan determinations and show no discrepancies from what was found in the literature. Although further research in data processing is required, it can be concluded that metabarcoding with MinION sequencing is a valuable innovation in the field of biomonitoring.","Willemse, S.",,"Willemse, Stijn, S.","Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Gent Univesity",,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering,,Belgium,x,University,Science

Yet, the knowledge base needed to identify gaps and priorities for NIS research and management is limited. Here, we reviewed primary introduction events to each ecoregion of the marine Arctic realm to identify temporal and spatial patterns, likely source regions of NIS, and the putative introduction pathways. We included 54 introduction events representing 34 unique NIS. The rate of NIS discovery ranged from zero to four species per year between 1960 and 2015. The Iceland Shelf had the greatest number of introduction events (n = 14), followed by the Barents Sea (n = 11), and the Norwegian Sea (n = 11). Twenty of the 54 introduction records had no known origins. The majority of those with known source regions were attributed to the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, each with 14 records. Some introduction events were attributed to multiple possible pathways. For these introductions, vessels transferred the greatest number of aquatic NIS (39%) to the Arctic, followed by natural spread (30%) and aquaculture activities (25%). Similar trends were found for introductions attributed to a single pathway. The phyla Arthropoda and Ochrophyta had the highest number of recorded introduction events, with 19 and 12 records, respectively. Recommendations including vector management, horizon scanning, early detection, rapid response, and a pan‐Arctic biodiversity inventory are considered in this paper. Our study provides a comprehensive record of primary introductions of NIS for marine environments in the circumpolar Arctic and identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities for NIS research and management.

Much of our understanding of long temporal-scale change in plankton communities in the North Sea has been provided by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, operating since 1931, with consistent time-series data available since 1958. This article further increases the temporal scale of our understanding of community change in the North Sea by combining the CPR dataset with a digitized collection of plankton surveys undertaken by ICES from 1902 to 1912. After steps taken to integrate the two disparate datasets, differences in overall community composition between time periods suggest that the multidecadal changes observed through the CPR survey time period may have occurred from a non-stable baseline that was already on a trajectory of change. Therefore, a stable historical time period in which plankton communities are assessed against for any impact of human pressures may be hard to define for the North Sea and instead underlying variation needs to be encompassed within any baseline chosen.

In this study, our aim was to test a number of commonly used structural (e.g. Shannon–Wiener, Average Taxonomic Diversity (Δ), M-AMBI) and functional indictors (e.g. BTA, BPc) currently used in benthic research and monitoring programmes on the Eden estuary (Scotland). Historically the estuary has a legacy of high nutrient conditions and was designated as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2003, whence major management measures were implemented in order to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms. We therefore collected data on intertidal macro-benthic communities over a sixteen year interval, covering a pre-management (1999) and post-management (2015) period to assess the effectiveness of the intended restoration efforts. In the post-management period, the results suggested an improvement in the structure and functioning of the estuary as a whole, but macro-benthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. The greatest improvements were noticed in the upper and central sites of the estuary with functional traits analysis suggesting an increased ability of these sites to provide ecosystem services associated with the benthic environment such as carbon and organic matter cycling. Generally, almost all of the structural and functional indicators detected the prevailing environmental conditions (with the exception of (Pielou’s index and Average Taxonomic Diversity (Δ)), highlighting the appropriateness of such methods to be used in monitoring the recovery of transitional systems. This research also provides a robust baseline to monitor further management actions in the Eden estuary and provides evidence that notable reductions in nitrate concentrations resulting from NVZ designations may result in significant improvements to benthic structure and functioning.","Watson, S.C.L.; Paterson, D.M.; Widdicombe, S.; Beaumont, N.J.",WOS:000449553500038,"Beaumont, Nicola, N.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.09.012,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Ecological indicators; Macro-invertebrates; Estuarine recovery; Ecological quality; M-AMBI; Biological traits analysis (BTA),Journal article,,,"Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Ctr Ecol Environm & Sustainabil, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",England,Ecological indicators; Macro-invertebrates; Estuarine recovery; Ecological quality; M-AMBI; Biological traits analysis (BTA),BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; NATURAL VARIABILITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; TEMPERATE ESTUARY; QUALITY; COASTAL; INDICATORS; ASSEMBLAGES,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Bournemouth University,,UK,,University,Science

Gut microbes, as well as the host animal, are involved in the process of polysaccharide degradation. To identify algal polysaccharide-digestion mechanisms and their origin, we analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of abalone visceral extracts. Microbial communities were characterized using the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the metagenome and our results differed significantly from those of previous studies using traditional microbiological methods such as bacterial cultivation and cloning. A greater diversity of bacterial taxa was identified here than was previously identified using cultivation methods. Furthermore, the most abundant bacterial taxa also differed from previous studies, which is not common when comparing the results of bacterial culturing with those of molecular methodologies. Based on the metatranscriptome, overall functions were identified and additional analyses were performed on the coding sequences of algal polysaccharide-digestive enzymes, including alginate lyase. Results of the transcriptomic analyses suggest that alginate lyase in the visceral extracts of <i>H. discus hannai</i> was produced by the host itself, not by visceral bacteria.

An earlier (2011) survey of then seagrass macrobenthic assemblages at 27 stations along over 1 km of that shore was exactly repeated in 2018 after this event. 2. After loss of seagrass, intertidal macrofauna became significantly less speciose (1:0.61), spatially and systematically more uniform (1:1.30 and 1:1.63), but more (not the usual less) abundant (0.62:1). Assemblage composition also changed, with polychaete numbers (small nereidids, spionids, fabriciids and an endemic paraonid) increasing from <50% of total macrofaunal individuals to >90% (although cirratulids decreased), whereas small malacostracan crustaceans (except the amphipod <i>Grandidierella</i> sp.) and microgastropods diminished to insignificant levels—microgastropods for reasons possibly unconnected with the green tide. 3. Comparison with areas not vegetated in 2014, however, indicated that although macrofaunal abundance was greater in the 2018 <i>Ulva</i>‐induced bare areas, levels of per unit area biodiversity (number of species, species and taxonomic diversity per station) were comparable. This suggests that the effect of local loss of seagrass cover is context dependent, particularly with regard to pre‐existing local seagrass versus adjacent bare‐sediment differentials, and does not necessarily lead to any “degraded” state. 4.

Twenty Mediterranean specimens of <i>L. guentheri</i> were collected and morphologically identified. <I>COI</I> and <i>cytb</i> reference sequences were then produced and included in two separate analyses (one for each gene) together with corresponding online sequences of <i>L. spadiceus</i> and <i>L. guentheri</i> from all the available localities. A high percentage of sequences with non-valid taxonomic identification was observed, involving 32.5% of the <I>COI</I> and 43.7% of the <i>cytb</i> sequences from GenBank and 30% of the <I>COI</I> sequences from BOLD. The majority of sequences deposited under <i>L. spadiceus</i>, mostly of Mediterranean origin, were genetically confirmed to be misidentified <i>L. guentheri</i>. Outcomes highlighted two main shortcomings: i) a low taxonomic accuracy of official databases due to the presence of sequences attributed to wrong species ; (ii) a significant underestimation of <i>L. guentheri</i> presence in the Mediterranean Sea. This study, therefore, underlines the necessity to improve the databases accuracy in term of deposited sequences reliability. In this specific case, accuracy is even more important, considering the involved toxic species and the potential concern for public health associated with their accidental entering in the seafood chain.","Giusti, A.; Guarducci, M.; Stern, N.; Davidovich, N.; Golani, D.; Armani, A.",WOS:000451934800002,"Guarducci, Marcella, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.10.003,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Lagocephalus, ""Lagocephalus guentheri"", ""Lagocephalus spadiceus""",,,Toxic pufferfish; Mediterranean environment; Genetic databases,Journal article,,,"Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, FishLab, Via Piagge 2, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",Italy,Toxic pufferfish; Lagocephalus guentheri; Lagocephalus spadiceus; Mediterranean environment; Genetic databases,SPADICEUS RICHARDSON; L.

However, knowledge of the reproductive biology is limited in scope, inhibiting best management practices and policies. In this thesis we determined the reproductive season, fecundity and sexual pattern. Samples were collected in 2012, 2015 and 2017 from three distinct landings in the southwestern region of the Gulf of California. The gonadosomatic index of each fish was calculated and their gonads were histologically analyzed to describe the gonadic and reproductive cycles. Partial fecundity of <i>C. colonus</i> was calculated using the hydrated oocytes method. To identify the sexual pattern, tissue structure from each gonad was analyzed and the size frequency distribution was compared by gender. A total of 484 samples were collected in this study, which were divided into 240 females and 242 males and 2 bisexual indivduals. Data from 2012 suggest a reproductive season from May to October, while data from 2015 indicated that reproduction started in February. Such differences may be related to variations in the sea temperature. Gonadic cycle was described with 6 and 7 phases for males and females respectively. It was found a partial fecundity value of 7.63*105±4.58*105 oocytes. There were no differences between the gender size distributions and no fish was observed undergoing sexual transition. These results suggest a gonocoric sexual pattern for <i>C. colonus</i> in the region.

After an exhaustive literature review, the available information of two centuries of scientific contributions is summarized. Thus, almost 3,100 valid species are currently recognized as living in the Argentine Sea. Part of this dataset was uploaded to the OBIS database, as a product of the Census of Marine Life-NaGISA project. A list of 3,064 valid species, grouped into 1,662 genera distributed in 808 families and 23 phyla, was assessed. The best represented taxa were Arthropoda and Mollusca, contributing approximately with the 50% of the mentioned species in the literature. Cumulative species curves were analyzed in order to estimate the percentage of marine invertebrate biodiversity that is currently known. However, no model fit to our data, showing that the recorded species represent less than 50% of the expected marine invertebrate biodiversity for the Argentine Sea. The great surface of the Argentine Marine Platform (6,581,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and the relative low effort in collecting and studying new species due to economical restrictions could explain the low fraction of described species.

We revisited two key sites at Great Inagua (GI) and San Salvador (SS) Island to test existing hypotheses about (1) the rate of sea level changes during the Last Interglacial period and (2) a possible gradient in peak sea level between these sites. Here, we provide precise elevation survey results for discrete stratigraphic horizons preserved at both locations, where two stages of reef growth are separated by a discontinuity that truncates corals in the lower reef. The discontinuity at Great Inagua manifests as a sharp wave-cut bench, with a maximum elevation of +1.14 m above mean sea level (MSL), that is sub-horizontal on the promontories and gradually slopes seaward in the embayments. At San Salvador, we observed a discontinuity that undulates between +0.85 and + 1.52 m. The uppermost surface of corals in growth position was measured at +1.94 m (GI) and +2.76 m (SS), although in situ collapse and truncation of large <i>Acropora palmata</i> colonies at the latter site implies that primary coral elevations were somewhat higher. Ultimately, assumptions regarding the amount of material truncated and paleowater depth of the observed reef facies at both sites dominate the uncertainty in calculating past sea level position and hence rates of sea-level change. Full consideration of errors associated with age and elevation data implies an ephemeral sea level drop of at least 1 m over a time frame of approximately one thousand years between two peaks in sea level.","Skrivanek, A.; Li, J.; Dutton, A.",WOS:000449900900010,"Skrivanek, Alexandra, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.09.033,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Quaternary,,Last interglacial; Coral; Bahamas; U-Th,Journal article,,,"Univ Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",USA,Quaternary; Last interglacial; Coral; Bahamas; U-Th,CORAL-REEFS; TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION; PROBABILISTIC ASSESSMENT; GRANITIC SEYCHELLES; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NORTH-ATLANTIC; ICE VOLUME; SERIES; MARINE; RISE,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,University of Florida,x,USA,,University,Science

The biogeographical pattern of lipids throughout the ocean delineates the marine “lipidscape,” which supports lipid‐rich fish, mammal, and seabird communities. While the importance of lipids is well appreciated, there are no synoptic measurements or biogeographical estimates of the marine lipidscape. Productive lipid‐rich food webs in the pelagic ocean depend on the critical diapause stage of large pelagic copepods, which integrate lipid production from phytoplankton, concentrating it in space and time, and making it available to upper trophic levels as particularly energy‐rich wax esters. As an important first step towards mapping the marine lipidscape, we compared four different modelling approaches of copepodid diapause, each representing different underlying hypotheses, and evaluated them against global datasets.Location: Global Ocean.Taxon: Copepoda.Methods: Through a series of global model runs and data comparisons, we demonstrated the potential for regional studies to be extended to estimate global biogeographical patterns of diapause. We compared four modelling approaches each designed from a different perspective: life history, physiology, trait‐based community ecology, and empirical relationships. We compared the resulting biogeographical patterns and evaluated the model results against global measurements of copepodid diapause.Results: Models were able to resolve more than just the latitudinal pattern of diapause (i.e. increased diapause prevalence near the poles), but to also pick up a diversity of regions where diapause occurs, such as coastal upwelling zones and seasonal seas. The life history model provided the best match to global observations. The predicted global biogeographical patterns, combined with carbon flux estimates, suggested a lower bound of 0.031–0.25 Pg C yr−1 of downward flux associated with copepodid diapause. Main conclusions: Results indicated a promising path forward for representing a detailed biogeography of the marine lipidscape and its associated carbon flux in global ecosystem and climate models. While complex models may offer advantages in terms of reproducing details of community structure, simpler theoretically based models appeared to best reproduce broad‐scale biogeographical patterns and showed the best correlation with observed biogeographical patterns.","Record, N.R.; Ji, R.; Maps, F.; Varpe, O.; Runge, J.A.; Petrik, C.M.",WOS:000452234900002,"Petrik, Colleen, C.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.13414,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Copepoda,,,copepod; diapause; global biogeography; ipidscape; model; trait,Journal article,,,"Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA.",USA,copepod; diapause; global biogeography; lipidscape; model; trait,NE NORWEGIAN SEA; CALANUS-FINMARCHICUS; LIFE-HISTORY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; RIGHT WHALE; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; CARBON FLUX; ZOOPLANKTON; CLIMATE; GROWTH,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences,x,USA,,Research institute,Science

Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts.

Difficulties in classification have hindered the understanding of oyster diversity and evolution. Recent molecular studies of living oysters have revealed high genetic diversity at species, population, and genome levels. New and cryptic species have been discovered, revealing surprisingly high species diversity under similar shell morphology. Genetic analyses have identified several species complexes where low genetic divergence indicates recent or ongoing speciation during the past 3–4 million years. Ongoing speciation is also supported by exceptionally high population divergence within some species. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and gene-rich, with extensive expansion of genes related to stress and immune responses. High levels of genetic diversity and gene expansion in oysters are likely adaptations to variable environments. Local adaptation in oysters may be pervasive but countered by strong gene flow and balancing or multidirectional selections that favor diversity. Oysters have experienced several expansion and contraction events because of climate change since their origin in Permian. Studies on molecular adaptations to recent and historic climate change may provide insights into the evolution and speciation of oysters.","Guo, X.; Li, C.; Wang, H.; Xu, Z.",WOS:000454313100007,"Wang, Haiyan, H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.037.0407,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Gryphaeidae, ""Ostreidae""","Climate change, ""Genetic diversity"", ""Speciation""",,oyster genome; local adaptation,Journal article,,,"Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, 6959 Miller Ave, Port Norris, NJ 08349 USA.",USA,genetic diversity; oyster genome; local adaptation; speciation; climate change; Ostreidae; Gryphaeidae,TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS REVEALS; BIVALVIA OSTREIDAE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; MORPHOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION; CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; MASS EXTINCTION; POPULATION-GENETICS; EASTERN OYSTER; CUPPED OYSTERS; SACCOSTREA,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Rutgers State University,x,USA,,University,Science

However, there is currently a lack of empirical research looking at host diet as a potential predictor of parasite diversity among different host species. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of several host diet features (including diet breadth, diet composition, and trophic level) on tapeworm diversity in sharks, relative to other key factors, including host size, habitat, phylogeny, latitude, and depth. Data on these host features were compiled from a comprehensive analysis of literature records including 91 different shark species, and 3 measures of tapeworm diversity were examined: tapeworm species richness, tapeworm taxonomic distinctness (TD), and variance in tapeworm TD. The diet breadth of a shark species was revealed to be a better predictor of tapeworm species richness than other host features examined to date. Host size, trophic level, diet TD, latitudinal range, and the mid-point of a shark’s depth range also significantly influenced tapeworm richness when analyses were adjusted to prevent confounding by phylogenetic relationships between hosts. The TD of tapeworm assemblages was influenced by diet breadth, diet TD, host size, and depth range when analysed independently of host phylogeny. Overall, our findings demonstrate that aspects of host diet have important consequences for parasite diversity in sharks. We emphasise that studies of parasite diversity in other systems should more seriously consider including aspects of host diet (particularly diet breadth) as potential key predictors of parasite diversity.","Rasmussen, T.K.; Randhawa, H.S.",WOS:000449165100001,"Randhawa, H.S.","Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Ecol Degree Programme, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12751,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Cestoda,"Sharks, ""Species diversity""",,Cestodes; Tapeworms; pecies richness; Diet; Taxonomic distinctness; Phylogenetically independent contrasts,Journal article,,,"Univ Otago, Ecol Degree Programme, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Sharks; Cestodes; Tapeworms; Species richness; Diet; Species diversity; Taxonomic distinctness; Phylogenetically independent contrasts,SPECIES RICHNESS; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; PHYLOGENIES; LARVAL; FISHES; SIZE; BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; HOTSPOTS,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of Otago - Department of Botany - Ecology program,,New Zealand,,University,Science

Most studies did not include sufficient metadata to be included in many of the analyses. For all analyses, there were differences among major groups of taxa in terms of response to the considered variables. Increased temperature was frequently correlated with decreased development time and increased growth but often not for the same taxa. Increased larval density was generally correlated with increased development time, but again, the patterns were not consistent across taxa. The most consistent pattern was the positive correlation between per capita food availability and larval growth. In all but two cases, patterns for the most studied species, <i>Crepidula fornicata</i>, were opposite those of other caenogastropods. This indicates that caution should be used when drawing general patterns among species based on studies of <i>C. fornicata</i>. Among lecithotrophs, the vetigastropod <i>Haliotis rufescens</i> was the most studied. In this case, patterns found for this species were similar to those for all other vetigastropods; however, few species outside the genus <i>Haliotis</i> have been studied. Increased temperature was associated with reduced survivorship and, in the most studied clade, the Vetigastropoda, reduced time to metamorphosis, which suggests that there may be an energetic cost to more rapid development or physiological mechanisms for coping with heat stress. Curiously, increased larval density was associated with increased survivorship for lecithotrophs. In several cases, however, there were too few studies, or the studies that were found did not provide enough metadata to be included in analyses. Although some patterns emerged from existing research on gastropod larvae, studies on a more diverse set of species that report all metadata are required for cross-study comparisons, which are crucial for drawing robust general conclusions.","Padilla, D.K.; Charifson, D.; Liguori, A.; McCarty-Glenn, M.; Rosa, M.; Rugila, A.",WOS:000454313100014,"Charifson, David, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.037.0414,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Crepidula fornicata, ""Haliotis""",,,lecithotrophic development; planktotrophic development; veliger,Journal article,,,"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 650 Life Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",USA,Crepidula fornicata; Haliotis; lecithotrophic development; planktotrophic development; veliger,ABALONE HALIOTIS-RUFESCENS; CONCH STROMBUS-GIGAS; POST-METAMORPHIC PERFORMANCE; SIBOGAE BERGH GASTROPODA; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID GABA; JUVENILE GROWTH-RATES; CREPIDULA-FORNICATA L; 2 MARINE GASTROPODS; QUEEN CONCH; FOOD LIMITATION,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,SUNY Stony Brook,x,USA,,University,Science

The aim of this work was to describe <i>Acanthaster planci</i> in the reef areas of the Gulf of California. The study was conducted through the collection of data (2004-2017) obtained from biological monitoring of reef invertebrates and photographic records from various institutions and civil organizations. The abundance of 1,075 band transects (25 x 2 m) was estimated. A record of the disc diameter of 493 individuals was made in the years 2008, 2015, 2016 and 2017 with a flexible measuring tape (1 mm precision) and by measurements with photographs. To describe the type of feeding of A. planci, a  photographic analysis was made, where the organisms from which it feeds were identified up to the possible taxonomic level. There were 2,680 individuals, with an average density of 0.050 + 0.001 ind / m<sup>2</sup>, where the minimum and maximum density were presented during 2016 and 2006, respectively. This density pattern of less than one organism per square meter is common among conspicuous reef echinoderms. The average disc diameter was 17.28 ± 0.22 cm. The smallest star (4.5 cm) was recorded at 27°N, while the largest (36 cm) at 24°N. The larger individuals are concentrated in the southern part (24°-26°N) of the Gulf, while in the North (26°-28°N) smaller individuals are presented, which indicates that as the latitude increases the size of the organisms decreases. A total of 66 individuals were identified feeding on a varied diet, with a greater preference for hermatypic corals such as <i>Pocillopora</i> spp. and <i>Porites panamensis</i>, followed by turf algae. In the Gulf of California <i>Acanthaster planci</i> is a reef echinoderm with densities that have remained relatively stable over time, with a general diet that consists mainly of hermatypic corals, but also of other invertebrates and even algae.

For many countries, the spatial extent and boundaries of fishing grounds are not completely known. We used satellite images at night to detect fishing grounds in the Philippines for fishing gears that use powerful lights to attract coastal pelagic fishes. We used nightly boat detection data, extracted by U.S. NOAA from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), for the Philippines from 2012 to 2016, covering 1713 nights, to examine spatio-temporal patterns of fishing activities in the country. Using density-based clustering, we identified 134 core fishing areas (CFAs) ranging in size from 6 to 23,215 km<sup>2</sup> within the Philippines’ contiguous maritime zone. The CFAs had different seasonal patterns and range of intensities in total light output, possibly reflecting differences in multi-gear and multi-species signatures of fishing activities in each fishing ground. Using maximum entropy modeling, we identified bathymetry and chlorophyll as the main environmental predictors of spatial occurrence of these CFAs when analyzed together, highlighting the multi-gear nature of the CFAs. Applications of the model to specific CFAs identified different environmental drivers of fishing distribution, coinciding with known oceanographic associations for a CFA’s dominant target species. This case study highlights nighttime satellite images as a useful source of spatial fishing effort information for fisheries, especially in Southeast Asia.","Geronimo, R.C.; Franklin, E.C.; Brainard, R.E.; Elvidge, C.D.; Santos, M.D.; Venegas, R.; Mora, C.",WOS:000448555800104,"Mora, Camilo, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/rs10101604,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,VIIRS; fisheries; maximum entropy; mapping,Journal article,,,"US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA.",USA,VIIRS; fisheries; maximum entropy; mapping,SMALL PELAGIC FISH; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; ECOSYSTEM APPROACH; FISHERIES; LIGHT; PACIFIC; HABITAT; PREDICTION; TRACKING; MAXENT,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,NOAA National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration,,USA,,Governmental body,Policy

However, there has been little work exploring their role with empirical data. In particular, the variation associated with species’ life cycles, which is prevalent and represents both trait variation and taxonomic identity, has received little attention. Here, we characterize the structural consequences of life stage variation in five food webs, including a newly compiled web from the Arabian Gulf. We show that making life stage variation explicit in food webs results in larger food webs that possess consistent structural changes that are separate from the changes in structure that come simply from increasing the number of nodes in the webs. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of these changes is related to ontogenetic specialism, the degree of overlap in the ecological niches of life stages. These results demonstrate the capacity of intraspecific variation to affect ecological networks and indicate the potential usefulness of stage‐structured food webs, which capture size and taxonomic information, to represent variation below the species level.","Clegg, T.; Ali, A.; Beckerman, A.P.",WOS:000451909200008,"Clegg, Tom, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ecy.2523,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,ecological network; empirical food web; ontogenetic niche shift; ontogeny; predator–prey; stage structure,Journal article,,,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",England,ecological network; empirical food web; ontogenetic niche shift; ontogeny; predator-prey; stage structure,TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; STAGE STRUCTURE; BODY-SIZE; NICHE; VISUALIZATION; FISHERIES,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Sheffield - Department of Animal & Plant Sciences,x,UK,,University,Science

These morphs are mainly considered the result of a differential food choice, with narrow heads feeding primarily on small/soft prey and broad heads on large/hard prey. Yet, such a classification implies that head-width variation follows a bimodal distribution, leading to the assumption of disruptive selection. We investigated the head morphology of 272 eels, caught over three consecutive years (2015-2017) at a single location in the Zeeschelde (Belgium). Based on our results, BIC favored a unimodal distribution, while AIC provided equal support for a unimodal and a bimodal distribution. Notably, visualization of the distributions revealed a strong overlap between the two normal distributions under the bimodal model, likely explaining the ambiguity under AIC. Consequently, it is more likely that head-width variation followed a unimodal distribution, indicating there are no disruptive selection pressures for bimodality in the Zeeschelde.

PhD Thesis. Universitat de Barcelona: Barcelona.  173 + bijlage 1-XLVI pp.","Benthic diatoms, photoautotrophic, silicate plated, single-celled aquatic organisms dwelling on substrates, have been used in bioindication, since they are good indicators of ecological water state. In this thesis, we have used a multi-scalar approach to observe how diatoms from Spanish Mediterranean rivers are affected by the characteristics of the habitats they live in. These organisms were observed under a taxonomic-indicative, functional-grouped and morphometric prism. The samples stem from Mediterranean rivers pertaining to either the Ebro Basin, or jurisdictions of the Catalan rivers or the Júcar authorities. Ebro samples have a fundamental importance, due to their temporal frame of 10 years, which has permitted the establishment and observation of changes in diatom communities and their characteristics. Two experimental setups, comparing differing water compositions and hydrological characteristics, were made in the other basins. The structure of this thesis takes a gradual decrease in observation range. The macro-scale: chapter studied benthic diatom communities from the Ebro River Basin taxonomically, based on samplings ranging 10 years. We studied if diatom communities were maintained in time, or what parameters could help to the establishment of ecoregions. This study showed that the ecotype division of rivers established by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) did not reflect diatom assemblages well. A double approach of physico- chemical and diatom-sociological aggregation can create a better mirror of diatom communities, thus improving ecoregions for diatoms. The meso-scale chapter investigated the Segre, Ebro tributary, observing the relationship between land use and diatom assemblages and indicator values. Land uses have a direct effect on river water composition. Thus, a link between upstream land cover and diatom assemblages was expected. The results show that only the predominant covers affect both the composition of the diatom community and indicator values. Structural Equation Modelling comparisons have established changes in the importance of physicochemical parameters through time and depending on diatom community structure. Diversity indices and bioindicator values were affected mostly by physicochemical composition, and tangentially by land cover. In the micro-scale chapter, the reaction of diatoms at each site was studied. To do this, we parted the chapter in three sections, two life form experiments to observe how physicochemical composition and hydrology affect life forms, and how morphometry can be affected through abiotic parameter variation in time. The first, made in the Llobregat Basin, was an experimental approach to ascertain the effect of intrinsically different sites on diatom life forms and ecological guilds and the change when these communities are translocated. This showed that, although the physicochemical parameters seemed to favour functional groups, changing the community into a different site could still maintain some of the characteristic life forms. Then, a comparison of functional structure of the diatom community in temporary rivers (that lose part or the totality of its surface water) of Mediterranean basins along the northeast coast was made. It showed that the hydrological regime (connectedness of the stream in total) had a bigger impact than aquatic state (water quantity present at time of sampling). The disconnection of streams also affected the use of conventional diatom bioindicators that will be addressed in the future. Finally, in this microscale prism, we automatically photographed samples from the Ebro River to extract diatom morphometry features. Relating these to physicochemical parameters of each site and their temporal variability, we saw that diatom sizes are affected by water composition. The surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) was highly correlated. An up to now neglected parameter, diatom width, was highly affected by physicochemical parameters. This thesis attempted to establish how diatoms and their traits are affected by their surroundings, observing the effect of abiotic parameters, such as physicochemical composition, land use, and substrate characteristics.","Burfeid Castellanos, A.M.",,"Burfeid Castellanos, Andrea Montserrat, A.M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,,"Aquatic ecology, ""Biodiversity"", ""Diatoms"", ""Rivers""",,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we have studied fouling communities from 10 port areas of south Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean) and Gulf of Lion (Mediterranean Sea). A total of 834 individuals were genetically barcoded and corresponded to 95 different species. A total of 76 native species 8 genera and 1 family were identified, 58 from the Bay of Biscay and 23 from the Gulf of Lion. Furthermore, 19 species were identified as non-indigenous or cryptogenic (18 from the Bay of Biscay and 4 from the Gulf of Lion). We found a high proportion of Antipode non-indigenous species (NIS) that represented the 19.3% of all sampled individuals and the 54.21% of NIS specimens of this study. A framework for inference of donor regions based on a phylogenetic screening of genetic sequences was proposed as a proof of concept and tested, as well as models for the relationship between NIS introductions, maritime imports and distance to NIS native range and inferred donor areas. Consistent generalized linear models (GLM) with positive association between NIS genetic diversity and distance, not with maritime growth weight imports, strongly suggest that distant NIS could pose higher invasion risk than closer species. Selection for wider tolerance ranges during the long travel –direct or stepwise, as well as environmental similarity between donor and receiving regions, may explain these results.","Miralles, L.; Ardura, A.; Clusa, L.; Garcia-Vazquez, E.",WOS:000448950500066,"Ardura, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-018-34447-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, C Julian Claveria S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",Spain,,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; MYTILUS-TROSSULUS; EUROPEAN SEAS; SPECIES INVASIONS; NEW-ZEALAND; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; ATLANTIC; POPULATION; DIVERSITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Oviedo,,Spain,,University,Science

Following bioassay guided fractionation, we assessed the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities of Holothuria polii (H. polii) extracts.  Methods: Sea cucumber ethanolic extract and the partially purified aqueous fractions were assessed for their antiproliferative activities. These latter bioactivities were evaluated in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures using trypan blue exclusion assay. The tumor-suppressive effects of sea cucumber ethanolic extract and aqueous fractions were assayed by measuring the trans-well invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and the expression of some epithelial mesenchymal transition markers using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The anti-inflammatory activity of the aqueous fraction was tested by measuring the secreted levels of interleukin-6, nitric oxide, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 in endotoxin-induced mammary epithelial SCp2 cells and interleukin-1β in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-activated human monocytic THP-1 cells.  Results: Sea cucumber ethanolic extract and the aqueous fraction significantly decreased the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells by more than 50% at similar and noncytotoxic concentrations and caused an arrest in the S-phase of the cell cycle of treated cells. In contrast, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol organic fractions did not show any significant activity. Furthermore, sea cucumber ethanolic extract and aqueous fraction reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in three-dimensional cultures by more than 60% at noncytotoxic concentrations. In addition, treatment with these concentrations resulted in the loss of stellate outgrowths in favor of spherical aggregates and a 30% decrease in invasive properties. Both sea cucumber ethanolic extract and aqueous decreased the transcription of vimentin and the protein expression levels of vimentin and N-cadherin in three-dimensional cultures. The aqueous fraction decreased the levels of inflammatory markers interleukin-6, nitric oxide, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 in the mouse mammary SCp2 cells, and the level of interleukin-1β produced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-activated THP-1 human monocytic cells.  Conclusion: The data reveal for the first time promising anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities in H. polii water extract in two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture models.

Here, we analysed the spatial distribution of 35,000 marine species (varying from copepods to sharks) to identify missing occurrences (gaps) across their latitudinal range. We find a latitudinal gradient of species absence peaking near the equator, a pattern observed in both shallow and deep waters. The tropical gap in species distribution seems a consequence of reduced sampling effort at low latitudes. Overall, our results suggest that spatial gaps in species distribution are the main cause of the bimodal pattern of marine diversity.

Sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (mtDNA <i>cox2</i>) gene were used to identify these nematodes to species level and to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship among various taxa. All the 15 third-stage larvae of <i>Anisakis</i> nematodes investigated in this study belonged to the same genetic lineage as the <i>A. typica</i> species complex (named here as <i>A. typica</i> sp. T – T for Thailand). Eight mtDNA <i>cox2</i> haplotypes were revealed in the 15 isolates of this <i>Anisakis</i> from Thailand. The mtDNA <i>cox2</i> haplotypes of <i>A. typica</i> sp. T from Thailand were genetically distinct from those of the A. typica sensu stricto. Taxonomic description of this <i>A. typica</i> sp.

The pesticides lead to pollution of the ground water, aquatic environments and also marine environment. It directly enters the food chains of the organisms, and it affects the marine ecosystems. The pesticides alter the regular functions of the marine organisms as well as the physiological structure. Results: The toxic effect of phorate on fertilization, early developmental stages of <i>H. elegans</i>, was examined, and it was found that the rate of successful development of embryonic development decreased when the concentration of phorate increased in sea water. The results present here strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of the pesticide probably acts on several intracellular targets based on EC50 values of the present study. It indicates that phorate was most toxic to the early developmental stages of <i>H. elegans</i>. Conclusion: The results indicate that the early development of <i>H. elegans</i> is highly sensitive to phorate. The sedentary polychaete, Hydroides elegans, can be routinely used as a test organism for eco-toxicity bioassays at tropical and subtropical regions","Vijayaragavan, S.; Vivek Raja, P.",,"Vijayaragavan, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s41936-018-0058-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Hydroides elegans, ""Hydroides elegans (Haswell, 1883)""",,,"Phorate; Hydroides elegans embryo, Fertilization; Blastula",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taxon: Marine benthic fauna (Arthropoda, Bryozoa, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Porifera, Sipuncula, and fishes).Methods: All available electronic records of fauna from the above taxa and ≥200 m depth off the southern Australian coastline, regardless of organism size, were collated from Australian museums and checked for geographic and taxonomic consistency. These records were then split into 40 geographic segments of roughly equal numbers, with each segment then treated as a sample in multivariate analyses of assemblage composition. Data from a recent (2015) systematic beam trawl survey along five north–south transects in the central Great Australian Bight were also included for comparison.Main conclusions: The systematic survey data grouped with the associated geographic segments despite differences in sampling technique (single gear compared to multiple gears), with subsequent differences in taxonomic biases, and the use of a 25 mm mesh, which would undersample some smaller organisms present in the museum data. Thus, the museum data and the survey data provided the same results for the central Great Australian Bight at the level of the whole assemblage. The main biogeographic break occurred off southeastern Tasmania, with a second substantial break occurring at around the border between New South Wales and Victoria. This indicates the potential for unused museum data to describe biogeographic patterns over regional spatial scales, especially in the deep sea where the expense of collecting new data is relatively high.","Tanner, J.E.; Althaus, F.; Sorokin, S.J.; Williams, A.",WOS:000454107200005,"Sorokin, Shirley, S.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.4565,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pisces,"Continental slope, ""Deep sea""",,demersal fish; epifauna; marine megafaunal invertebrates; southern Australia,Journal article,,,"South Australian Res & Dev Inst Aquat Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",Australia,continental slope; deep sea; demersal fish; epifauna; marine megafaunal invertebrates; southern Australia,BIODIVERSITY,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,SARDI (South Australian Research & Development Institute) - Aquatic Sciences Research Division,x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

The present work is a compilation and summary of systematics, species diversity and new taxa of mesozooplankton major group known in West Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas (0°–45°N, 105°–152°E) according to 6 203 mesozooplankton samples acquired from 701 stations during 1965 and 2008. A total of 2 657 species belonging to 686 genera and 206 families of 10 mesozooplankton groups have been found through taxonomic identification and document consulting. In details, 697 species from 251 genera of 99 families belong to the Medusozoa, 59 species from 22 genera of 12 families to the Ctenophora, 85 species from 36 genera of 14 families to the pelagic Mollusca (Pteropoda and Heteropoda), 416 species from 91 genera of 8 families to the Ostracoda, 908 species from 156 genera of 51 families to the Copepoda, 202 species from 60 genera of 4 families to the Mysidacea, 56 species from 8 genera of 2 families to the Euphausiacea, 105 species from 23 genera of 8 families to the Decapoda, 48 species from 13 genera of 5 families to the Chaetognatha and 81 species from 26 genera of 5 families to the Tunicata.

Here, we used a 26‐year time series (1987 – 2012) of fish monitoring in the Bay of Somme, a nursery in the Eastern English Channel, to examine the impacts of environmental and human drivers on the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish functional structure during a warming phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). We found that the nursery was initially dominated by fishes with r‐selected life history traits such as low trophic level, low age and size at maturity, and small offspring, which are highly sensitive to warming. The AMO, likely superimposed on climate change, induced rapid warming in the late 1990s (over 1°C from 1998 – 2003), leading to functional reorganization of fish communities, with a roughly 80% decline in overall fish abundance and increased dominance by K‐selected fishes. Additionally, historical overfishing likely rendered the bay more vulnerable to climatic changes due to increased dominance by fishing‐tolerant, yet climatically‐sensitive species. The drop in fish abundance not only altered fish functional structure within the Bay of Somme, but the Eastern English Channel was likely impacted, as the Eastern Channel has been unable to recover from a regime shift in the late 1990s potentially, in part, due to failed replenishment from the bay. Given the collapse of r‐selected fishes, we discuss how the combination of climate cycles and global warming could threaten marine fish nurseries worldwide, as nurseries are often dominated by r‐selected species.","McLean, M.J.; Mouillot, D.; Goascoz, N.; Schlaich, I.; Auber, A.",WOS:000456028900022,"McLean, Matthew, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.14501,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",English Channel,,"Climate change, ""Fisheries"", ""Life history"", ""Recruitment""",,AMO; functional traits,Journal article,,,"IFREMER, Unite Halieut Manche & Mer Nord, Boulogne Sur Mer, France.",France,Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; climate change; ecosystem function; English Channel; fisheries; functional traits; life history; recruitment,LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; ENGLISH-CHANNEL; FUZZY-LOGIC; R-SELECTION; IN-SITU; ESTUARINE; COMMUNITY; ECOSYSTEM; CONNECTIVITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IFREMER Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer,x,France,,Research institute,Science

As filter feeders, a major ecosystem service they provide is water filtration and the vertical transfer of suspended organic and attached inorganic material to the sea floor. Laboratory and field studies previously demonstrated that blue mussels can remove large quantities of plankton from the surrounding water. I here perform numerical experiments that investigate the effect of filtration at the scale of an entire coastal sea—the southern North Sea. These experiments were performed with a state-of-the-art bentho-pelagic coupled hydrodynamic and ecosystem model and used a novel reconstruction of the benthic biomass distribution of blue mussels. The filtration effect was assessed as the simulated change in net primary productivity caused by blue mussels. In shallow water, filtration takes out up to half of the entire annual primary productivity; it is negligible in offshore waters. For the entire basin, the filtration effect is 10%. While many ecosystem models have a global parameterization for filter feeders, the coastal gradient in the filtration effect is usually not considered; our research demonstrates the importance of including spatially heterogeneous filtration in coupled bentho-pelagic ecosystem models if we want to better understand the spatial patterns in shallow water coastal systems.","Lemmen, C.",WOS:000451736300034,"Lemmen, Carsten, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/w10111527,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Mytilus edulis,,,southern North Sea; benthic filtration; ecosystem productivity ,Journal article,,,"Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",Germany,southern North Sea; Mytilus edulis; benthic filtration; ecosystem productivity,MUSSEL BEDS; WADDEN SEA; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODEL; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; ESTUARINE; MOLLUSKS; BIOMASS,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht,x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Time period: Recent; late Miocene–Pleistocene interval. Major taxa studied:  Benthic taxa with a rich fossil record: Bivalvia, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Gastropoda, Echinodermata, Decapoda and reef corals. Methods: We use occurrence data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Paleobiology Database to construct compositional networks and outline objective marine bioregions of benthic marine invertebrates using the “infomap” community detection algorithm. We assess the association of modern bioregions with a variety of environmental parameters by applying multivariate statistical analyses, such as principal components analysis, random forests and multiple logistic regressions. Results: Recent first‐order bioregions for the coastal ocean are, in general, consistent across all taxa. Seawater temperature surpasses nutrients, primary production and salinity as a predictor of modern bioregion distributions. Despite substantial climatic variations, late Cenozoic biogeographical patterns recorded in fossils are very similar to modern ones. Main conclusions : Biogeographical boundaries within oceans are strongly controlled by temperature gradients, but open oceanic and continental barriers determine the global biogeographical structure. The joint structure of a landmass distribution, deep ocean basins and the latitudinal temperature gradient defines bioregionalization of the benthic marine habitat, which did not change substantially over the past 10 Myr.","Kocsis, A.T.; Reddin, C.J.; Kiessling, W.",WOS:000448647200009,"Kocsis, Ádám, A.T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12771,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""EUROBIS ackn - indirect use"", ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,"Marine invertebrates, ""Networks"", ""Temperature""",,global; palaeobiogeography; recent biogeography,Journal article,,,"Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, GeoZentrum Nordbayern, Loewenichstr 28, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",Germany,global; invertebrates; marine; networks; palaeobiogeography; recent biogeography; temperature,CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; MARINE; CLASSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; OCEAN; PROVINCES; DISPERSAL,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,University of Erlangen-Nuremberg - Geocentrum Nordbayern,x,Germany,,University,Science

Aim: To assess the impact of climate change on the functional diversity of marine zooplankton communities.2. Location: The Mediterranean Sea.3. Methods: We used the functional traits and geographic distributions of 106 copepod species to estimate the zooplankton functional diversity of Mediterranean surface assemblages for the 1965–1994 and 2069–2098 periods. Multiple environmental niche models were trained at the global scale to project the species habitat suitability in the Mediterranean Sea and assess their sensitivity to climate change predicted by several scenarios. Simultaneously, the species traits were used to compute a functional dendrogram from which we identified seven functional groups and estimated functional diversity through Faith's index. We compared the measured functional diversity to the one originated from null models to test if changes in functional diversity were solely driven by changes in species richness.4. Results: All but three of the 106 species presented range contractions of varying intensity. A relatively low decrease of species richness (−7.42 on average) is predicted for 97% of the basin, with higher losses in the eastern regions. Relative sensitivity to climate change is not clustered in functional space and does not significantly vary across the seven copepod functional groups defined. Changes in functional diversity follow the same pattern and are not different from those that can be expected from changes in richness alone.5. Main conclusions:  Climate change is not expected to alter copepod functional traits distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, as the most and the least sensitive species are functionally redundant. Such redundancy should buffer the loss of ecosystem functions in Mediterranean zooplankton assemblages induced by climate change. Because the most negatively impacted species are affiliated to temperate regimes and share Atlantic biogeographic origins, our results are in line with the hypothesis of increasingly more tropical Mediterranean communities.","Benedetti, F.; Ayata, S.-D.; Irisson, J.O.; Adloff, F.; Guilhaumon, F.",WOS:000463154200007,"Irisson, Jean Olivier, J.O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12857,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",Mediterranean,,Climate change,,functional diversity; niche modelling; null model,Journal article,,,"Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Phys UP Grp, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Switzerland,climate change; functional diversity; Mediterranean Sea; niche modelling; null model; zooplankton,CALANUS-HELGOLANDICUS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; TRAIT; FUTURE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; OCEAN; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,,Switzerland,,Research institute,Science

Polygordius (Annelida, Polygordiidae) have low morphological diversity, but are unusual among interstitial species in their comparatively large size due to their elongated form, high fecundity, and potential for long-distance dispersal via a planktotrophic larval stage. Polygordius species collected from 14 localities in the Northwest Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and Southwest Atlantic including several of the respective type localities were analysed. This study presents the first phylogeny of the genus Polygordius and combines molecular data, sequences of COI, 16S and ITS1/2 genes, and morphological data for a systematic re-evaluation focusing on Atlantic species, with an emphasis on populations from European waters. Phylogenetic analyses recovered six valid species (<i>P. appendiculatus, P. lacteus, P. neapolitanus, P. triestinus, P. jouinae, and P. eschaturus</i>) and their distinctness is confirmed by haplotype network analyses. Thus, molecular data supported the validity of the previously recognized morpho-species and no new species were present. <i>P. erythrophthalmus</i> and <i>P. villoti</i> are invalid species being synonymous with <i>P. lacteus</i>. Subtle differences in head and pygidial morphology and larval type (endolarva vs. exolarva), were useful characters for discrimination.

The main aim of the study was to understand the distribution pattern of macrobenthic functional feeding groups and their relationship to environmental drivers in the estuary. Malacostracan crustaceans dominated the system (60%) by numerical density, while molluscs contributed significantly to macrobenthic biomass (63%). Many species exploit the same class of resources within an assemblage of macrofaunal groups. The suspension feeding corophiid amphipod <i>Americorophium triaeonyx</i> was the most represented macrofaunal species. Other dominant macrofaunal feeding groups were the suspension feeding hydroid colonies of <i>Obelia bidentate</i>, surface deposit feeding polychaetes <i>Prionospio cirrifera</i>, suspension feeding mussels <i>Arcuatula senhousia</i>, carnivorous isopods <i>Cirolana fluviatilis</i> and sub-surface deposit feeding polychaetes <i>Capitella</i> sp. The sampling stations were compared using taxonomic distinctness (AvTD), and variations in taxonomic distinctness (VarTD), the values of AvTD and VarTD for all stations during the entire monthly survey fell within the confidence intervals of probability funnel (95%, p<0.05). However, a significant variation was noticed in the values between stations (AvTD: F (6,161) = 3.105, p=0.007; VarTD: F (6,161) = 2.489, p=0.025). The abundance biomass curves were plotted separately for each site as well as combined for the entire estuary. The relatively high negative trend was observed in the station 5 (W=−0.139) which indicates potential for the relatively high disturbance among all other stations.

Mexico possesses 11,122 km of coastline, shared among 17 coastal states with a total population of 55.4 million people (46% of the Mexican total population). The gross domestic product (GDP) emanating from the coastal states represents 40% of the national GDP and is mainly derived from industry, commerce, and services activities. Also, Mexican beaches are internationally recognized for their natural beauty. However, massive tourism, the high rate of resort development, environmental degradation and destruction, biodiversity loss, chaotic urban growth, pollution, sectorial conflicts, and the lack of public policies and programs at the local level increase the risk and vulnerability of the coastal environment. Three independent levels of government operate in Mexico: federal, state and municipal, each one with its own responsibilities and operative limitations defined by the Mexican Constitution. At the federal, state and municipal levels, several regulations are related to coastal management. The superposition and/or lack of specific regulatory tools creates a complex and sometimes chaotic framework for the development of coastal management initiatives. In recent years, a large effort has been undertaken at the federal level to solve this critical issue by creating the National Strategy for Ecological Ordinance of Seas and Coasts (SEMARNAT, 2006a), the National Environmental Policy for the Sustainable Development of Oceans and Coasts of Mexico (SEMARNAT, 2006b) and finally, the most comprehensive and integrated framework, the National Policy for Seas and Coasts (CIMARES-SEMARNAT, 2016). Despite these efforts, Mexico still lacks a specific “coastal law” that promotes the creation, implementation, and monitoring of an Integrated Coastal Management Program. The main objective of this document is to analyze the actual coastal development model in Mexico and several models worldwide as well as their consequences and opportunities for sustainability. Grounded in an extensive interdisciplinary knowledge of public policies, public participation processes, and technical planning instruments, it proposes general action lines to address the problem of coastal management in Mexico from the integral analysis of the development observed in its coastal areas.","Azuz-Adeath, I.; Le Bail, M.; Cortés Ruiz, A.",,"Le Bail, Maxime, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-810473-6.00003-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Coastal development; Coastal management and planning; Coastal models; Public policies; Mexico,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea pens are found worldwide from shallow to deep waters, and they are important components in sandy and muddy environments. Thus far, there has been only one molecular study focusing on the phylogenetic relationships within the order Pennatulacea, which mainly treated deep-sea species, and thus information on shallow water species is still lacking. On a regional scale, the diversity of sea pens in the northwestern Pacific, including Japan and Palau, has not been well investigated. In this research, we aimed to: (1) more accurately resolve the phylogenetic relationships of sea pens with the inclusion of shallow water species, and (2) obtain a better understanding of the diversity of sea pens in Japan and Palau. Specimens were collected by SCUBA and dredging from the Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan, and from mainland Japan and Palau, and identified to at least the genus level by their morphological traits. Construction of phylogenetic trees with concatenated sequences including the mitochondrial mutS-like protein DNA mismatch repair gene mtMutS and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 ND2 region were performed. The p-distances of mtMutS were calculated for estimation of species number following McFadden et al. (2011). Molecular data for 12 families and 20 genera of sea pens were used in this study. This most comprehensive study including shallow water taxa provided us with more knowledge of phylogenetic relationships. The resulting phylogenetic trees showed a topology distinguished by four large clades (clades 1–4). Families Veretillidae and Echinoptilidae are shown as not the earliest-diverging taxa. Virgulariidae and Scleroptilidae are shown as polyphyletic groups, and our results reconfirm that families Pennatulidae, Kophobelemnidae and Umbellulidae are not monophyletic groups. Overall, we collected and examined an estimated 18 species from the Ryukyu Islands, 16 species from mainland Japan, and five species from Palau. Some of these specimens represented new records from Ryukyu Islands and Palau. Previous records of these sea pens did not exist likely due to a lack of diversity research in sandy and muddy areas. These results demonstrate that many sea pens discoveries likely remain in shallow waters of the Pacific.","Kushida, Y.; Reimer, J.D.",WOS:000456387900025,"Reimer, James Davis, J.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.10.032,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Anthozoa, ""Pennatulacea""",,,Sea pens; Molecular phylogenetics; Diversity; Northwestern Pacific; Shallow water; Anthozoa,Journal article,,,"Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Mol Invertebrate SystEmat & Ecol Lab, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.",Japan,Sea pens; Molecular phylogenetics; Diversity; Northwestern Pacific; Shallow water; Anthozoa,ANTHOZOA OCTOCORALLIA; HEXACORALLIA; COELENTERATA; INFERENCE; MRBAYES; GENUS,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of the Ryukyus,x,Japan,,University,Science

Despite the economic and ecological importance of the calanoid copepod <i>Temora longicornis</i> in the Belgian part of the North Sea, molecular data is still very limited for this species. Using HiSeq Illumina sequencing, we sequenced the whole transcriptome of <i>T. longicornis</i>, after being exposed to realistic temperatures of 14 and 17 °C. After both an acute (1 day) and a more sustained (5 days) thermal exposure to 17 °C, we investigated gene expression differences with animals exposed to 14 °C, which may be critical for the thermal acclimation and resilience of this copepod species. We also studied the possibility of a short term stress recovery of a heat shock. A total of 179,569 transcripts were yielded, of which 44,985 putative ORF transcripts were identified. These transcripts were subsequently annotated into roughly 22,000 genes based on known sequences using Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases. <i>Temora</i> only showed a mild response to both the temperature and the duration of the exposure. We found that the expression of 27 transcripts varied significantly with an increase in temperature of 3 °C, of which eight transcripts were differentially expressed after acute exposure only. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that, overall, <i>T. longicornis</i> was more impacted by a sustained thermal exposure, rather than an immediate (acute) exposure, with two times as many enriched GO terms in the sustained treatment. We also identified several general stress responses independent of exposure time, such as modified protein synthesis, energy mobilisation, cuticle and chaperone proteins. Finally, we highlighted candidate genes of a possible recovery from heat exposure, identifying similar terms as those enriched in the heat treatments, i.e. related to for example energy metabolism, cuticle genes and extracellular matrix. The data presented in this study provides the first transcriptome available for <i>T. longicornis</i> which can be used for future genomic studies.","Semmouri, I.; Asselman, J.; Van Nieuwerburgh, F.; Deforce, D.; Janssen, C.R.; De Schamphelaere, K.A.C.",WOS:000458595600002,"Semmouri, Ilias, I.","Ghent University, Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Aquatic Ecology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.10.017,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,"Arthropoda, ""Crustacea""",,,North sea; BPNS; Global warming; Global change; Climate change; Temperature; Gene expression; Crustacea; Arthropoda; Zooplankton,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Lab Environm Toxicol & Aquat Ecol, Campus Coupure,Bldg F,2nd Floor,Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,North sea; BPNS; Global warming; Global change; Climate change; Temperature; Gene expression; Crustacea; Arthropoda; Zooplankton,DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES; APOLIPOPROTEIN-D; PELAGIC COPEPODS; SHOCK PROTEINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BELGIAN PART; TIME-SERIES; ZOOPLANKTON; TEMPERATURE; GENOME,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Animal sciences and aquatic ecology - Environmental Toxicology Unit (GhEnToxLab),x,,,,

Since 2008, a water area of 4025 km<sup>2</sup> has been given the status of a botanical sanctuary of national importance «Zernov's <i>Phyllophora </i>Field». The goal of the present study is to assess the species richness and quantitative development of macrozoobenthos of the ZPF and their long-term variations under the current conditions of de-eutrophication of the Black Sea basin. The work is based on the material of 43 benthos stations performed in 2010–2013 within an area of 8400 km<sup>2</sup> in the ZPF. In 2010–2013, a total of 162 macrozoobenthos species were identified: Polychaeta (49 species), Mollusca (39), Crustacea (43), Ascidiacea (6); the other taxa comprised 25 species. The current level of species richness of macrozoobenthos is the highest for the entire historical period of the ZPF studies. The mean abundance and wet biomass of macrozoobenthos were estimated at 2417 ± 175 individuals/m² and 283 ± 32 g/m² (without mantle cavity fluid of bivalves). Values for Polychaeta amounted to 1017 individuals/m² and 6 g/m², Mollusca – 887 individuals/m² and 256 g/m², Crustacea – 165 individuals/m² and 1.3 g/m², Ascidiacea – 42 individuals/m² and 17 g/m². The biomass of the dominant species, the filter-feeders <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>, reaches 73% of the total macrozoobrnthos biomass. Our research of the long-term alterations in benthic macrofauna covers the period 1957 to 2013, including the pre-crisis time of the Black Sea ecosystem (1957–1960), its crises of the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (1979, 1984, 1991) and the modern (post-crisis) stage (2010–2013). Based on the maps of biomass spatial distribution for all periods mentioned above, the mean values and the total stocks of macrozoobenthos within the area 8400 km<sup>2</sup> of the ZPF were evaluated. The long-term changes of the macrozoobenthos biomass were analysed in relation to the main factors adversely affected the bottom biocoenoses in NWBS – i.e. anthropogenic eutrophication, oxygen depletion and near-bottom hypoxia in summer, as well as the secondary siltation of the seabed due to intensive near-bottom trawling. The most critical period for the ZPF ecosystem state occurred in the late 1970s, when the mean biomass and the total stock of macrozoobenthos decreased by 7 times in comparison with the pre-crisis period. The data collected in the first decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century indicate the actual recovery of the mean macrozoobenthos biomass and of its total stock in the ZPF area to the level of 1957–1960, which is related to the improving of the general ecological situation in the region.","Revkov, N.K.; Boltacheva, N.A.; Timofeev, V.A.; Bondarev, I.P.; Bondarenko, L.V.",WOS:000453601500003,"Revkov, Nikolay, N.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.24189/ncr.2018.045,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"abundance, benthic macrofauna, biomass, long-term dynamics, Marine Protected Area, Phyllophora, stocks of macrozoobenthos",Journal article,,,"AO Kovalevsky Inst Marine Biol Res RAS, Moscow, Russia.",Russia,abundance; benthic macrofauna; biomass; long-term dynamics; Marine Protected Area; Phyllophora; stocks of macrozoobenthos,,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - A.

Observed impacts driven by climate have been recorded and include changes in the geographical distribution, timing of seasonal migrations, breeding biology and behaviour of species. A number of qualitative and quantitative methodologies have been developed over the years to assess the vulnerability of animals to climate change. However, for marine species, the development and application of indices is recent, especially for large vertebrates such as marine mammals. In this context, the present study develops a trait-based climate change vulnerability index and applies it to seven cetacean species in the Madeira archipelago (Northeast Atlantic). The development of the index included the selection of sensitivity and exposure factors, the definition of each factor’s score range, and the computation of results. It showed that the sperm whale (<i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>), the fin whale (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>), the Atlantic population of bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) and the Bryde’s whale (<i>Balaenoptera brydei</i>) were the most vulnerable species. The short-beaked common dolphin (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>), the island-associated bottlenose dolphins and the Atlantic spotted dolphin (<i>Stenella frontalis</i>) showed the lowest vulnerability to climate change. The outputs are consistent with previously proposed effects on whales and dolphins, considering their ecological similarities and exposure to environmental factors.

To limit the risks of predation, many marine mesograzers live within nests or burrows, potentially causing more damage to plants than predicted from consumption alone. To test whether the growth of large primary producers can be affected by modification of plant structures by small herbivores, we quantified the effect of the nest-building amphipod <i>Pseudopleonexes lessoniae</i> on blades of the giant kelp, <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> in New Zealand. Amphipods create their nests by rolling the blade margin in close proximity to the meristem. Blades with nests were 40% shorter than blades lacking nests and reduced in area by 55%. We examined the composition of amphipods inhabiting each nest to assess the temporal persistence of grazer aggregations. Nests were occupied by a single female or male–female pairs, and their newly hatched offspring. Analysis of offspring size distributions suggested that offspring dispersed from the maternal nest and did not remain to breed themselves. By concentrating physical damage and feeding on valuable tissues, these results indicate that even low numbers of small herbivores can cause localized impacts on the morphology and size of fast-growing algal blades. Predicting the consequences of this damage on larger scales will require understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of amphipod nests on giant kelp.","Poore, A.G.B.; Gutow, L.; Lörz, A.-N.; Thiel, M.",WOS:000450511900002,"Gutow, Lars, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-018-3444-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Macrocystis pyrifera, ""Pseudopleonexes lessoniae""",,,,Journal article,,,"Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",Australia,,NORTHERN-CENTRAL CHILE; HERBIVOROUS AMPHIPODS; LESSONIA-NIGRESCENS; FAMILY AMPITHOIDAE; BORING AMPHIPOD; PLANT; IMPACTS; CONSEQUENCES; SEAWEEDS; COROPHIOIDEA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of New South Wales - School of Biological Earth and Environment Sciences - Evolution & Ecology Research Centre,x,,,,

Species identification was initially conducted morphologically, with confirmation by Cox 1 DNA sequencing. 16S gene sequencing enabled the taxonomic assignment of the microbiome, showing the prevalence of a large number of bacterial genera previously associated with TTX production including Alteromonas, <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. LC-MS/MS analysis of the nemertean tissue revealed the presence of multiple analogues of TTX, dominated by the parent TTX, with a total toxin concentration quantified at 54 µg TTX per g of tissue. <i>Pseudomonas luteola</i> isolated from <i>C. simula</i>, together with <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> from the native nemertean <i>Tubulanus annulatus</i>, were cultured at low temperature and both found to contain TTX. Overall, this paper confirms the high toxicity of a newly discovered invasive nemertean species with links to toxin-producing marine bacteria and the potential risk to human safety.

As marine industries expand, spatial interconnections and industry boundaries are being drawn and the potential for the combined use of marine space is being explored. The aim of this paper is to provide a single source document that summarizes the probable boundaries of marine growth industries, namely aquaculture; offshore wind energy with fixed foundations; floating offshore wind energy; tidal and wave energy; marine biotechnology, seabed mining; and tourism and recreation, based on depth and distance from the shore. This is an important first step in developing a single source document for marine industry boundaries that will help marine spatial planners and researchers develop innovative industry combinations to foster growth in the marine sector. This paper explores marine industry overlaps in four basins: European Atlantic, Baltic/North Sea, Mediterranean/Black Sea and the Caribbean/ Gulf of Mexico. By describing the geographical characteristics of different sea basins, this paper helps to focus marine governance strategies for stimulating combinations of marine industries towards the most promising areas.

This paper begins with a review of the literature on Arctic vessel traffic to assess the potential effects of various stressors related to vessel traffic in the Arctic Ocean. Available data concerning environmental and safety risks for the Arctic Ocean are used to propose vessel TSR vessel traffic routes that can reduce those risks. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of several examples of vulnerability assessments focused on impacts from vessel traffic in the Arctic as potential models for future work specific to the CAO. The results from this review indicate vessel oiling, air pollution, and noise from icebreakers are immediate concerns to the Arctic Ocean that will likely worsen as the region becomes more navigable and vessel traffic increases. The proposed vessel routes for the Arctic Ocean are meant to serve as a starting point for further discussions before the region becomes fully navigable. As additional data become available, these efforts can be refined further, and a rigorous vulnerability assessment may become possible.

We satellite-tracked turtles captured after nesting at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, US Virgin Islands to determine habitat-use patterns of endangered adult female hawksbills (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>). For 31 turtles captured between 2011 and 2014, switching state-space modeling and home range analyses showed that inter-nesting (IN) core-use areas (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates [KDEs]) were 9.6 to 77.7 km2 in area, occupied for 21 to 85 days, and in shallow water (21 of 26 centroids > −10 m). The IN zones overlapped with areas both within the protected borders of BIRNM, and outside BIRNM (32% of turtle-tracking days outside during IN). Turtles migrated to their foraging grounds between July and October with path lengths ranging from 52 to 3524 km; foraging areas included 14 countries. Core-use foraging areas (50% KDEs) where turtles took up residence were 6.3 to 95.4 km<sup>2</sup>, occupied for 22 to 490 days, with mean centroid depth − 66 m.

Target 11 recommends that ecologically representative portions (10%) of important coastal and marine areas be set aside within MPAs. Despite global progress in attaining the 10% target, few areas are set aside with consideration of ecological representation (area and diversity of features) as a conservation goal. Using publicly available datasets of marine geomorphic features and benthic habitats, we assessed the relative representativeness of features, by assessing feature coverage and diversity, within existing protected areas of both Large Marine Ecosystem (LMEs) and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Only 18 of the 66 LMEs contained greater than 10% of their marine geomorphic features and benthic habitats within MPAs. The Caribbean, Pacific Central, Mediterranean and Canary Current LMEs were identified as areas that protected the most diversity, while the geomorphically diverse Arctic Ocean had the least area of features within MPAs. Less than one quarter of EEZs (46 out of 230) had more than 10% of their geomorphic features and benthic habitats within MPAs. The coral triangle and other warm water reef areas are clear priorities for conservation, exhibiting high diversity of geomorphic features and benthic habitats, yet, most LMEs and EEZs in these areas fail to achieve representativeness or 10% feature coverage. Australia, New Zealand and the United States and areas in Europe and the South Pacific achieve relative representativeness scoring highly in coverage and diversity of features protected. Assessing the coverage and diversity of protected features within EEZs and LMEs can assist nation states and ecosystem management regions to better assess representativeness in achieving the 2020 Aichi targets.","Fischer, A.; Bhakta, D.; Macmillan-Lawler, M.; Harris, P.",WOS:000453113900017,"Fischer, Andrew, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.10.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Tasmania, Coll Sci & Engn, IMAS Ecol & Biodivers Ctr, IMAS Launceston, Newnham Dr, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",Australia,,SUBMARINE CANYONS; GEOMORPHOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY; DEEP-SEA; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM; HOTSPOTS,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,University of Tasmania - Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS),x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

Based on a multilocus (COI, 16S, 28S and ITS2) dataset for 182 specimens collected in Antarctica and other regions worldwide, we investigated the actual Antarctic velutinid diversity, inferred their larval development, tested species genetic connectivity and produced a first phylogenetic framework of the family.

We investigated the relationship between the geographical patterns of two contrasting shell-surface morphotypes (smooth <em>vs</em> ribbed) and genetic diversity in East Asian members of the marine gastropod genus <em>Tegula</em>. We also investigated the geographical and genetic patterns of two shell-colour morphotypes (black <em>vs</em> light brown) in <em>Tegula xanthostigma.</em> We sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidase subunit I gene and the nuclear <em>28S</em> rRNA region, and performed phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation tests. Two morphotypes, distinguished by different sculpture, appeared sympatrically or allopatrically in several ESUs, but could not be distinguished genetically. In addition, although the black morphotype of <em>T. xanthostigma</em> (a smooth-shelled species) and individuals of <em>T. argyrostoma</em> (a ribbed species) have been traditionally classified as separate species, the inferred phylogeny suggests that they belong in same clade and ESU. We also conducted a statistical analysis to determine whether shell morphology (colour or sculpture) varies with the degree of coastal exposure. We found no association between exposure and surface morphology. However, in <em>T. xanthostigma</em> the light brown morphotype preferred sheltered sites when compared with the black morphotype. Molecular methods and statistical analyses showed that smooth <em>T. xanthostigma</em> were divided into two species, with shell colour and habitat preference differing among species. While our findings show that shell sculpture is not a reliable character to use for species delimitation in <em>Tegula</em>, they suggest that differences in habitat preferences may potentially drive the genetic divergences seen in this group.","Yamazaki, D.; Hirano, T.; Uchida, S.; Miura, O.; Chiba, S.",WOS:000462585500003,"Miura, Osamu, O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyy055,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Aoba Ku, 41 Kawauchi, Sendai, Miyagi 9800862, Japan.",Japan,,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; LOCAL ADAPTATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SPECIES DELIMITATION; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; TIDELAND SNAILS; SHELL COLOR; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Tohoku University,,Japan,,University,Science

Coral mucus, tissue, and skeleton microbiomes differ in microbial community composition, richness, and response to host vs. environmental drivers.

Because rates of molecular evolution vary among taxa and environments, it is essential to obtain clock calibrations from northern lineages. The recurrent opening and closure of the Bering Strait provide an exceptional opportunity for clock calibration. Here, we apply the iterative calibration approach to investigate patterns of molecular divergence among lineages of northern marine molluscs and arthropods using publicly available sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and compare these results with previous estimates of trans-Bering divergences for echinoderms and polychaetes. The wide range of Kimura two-parameter (K2P) divergences among 73 trans-Bering sister pairs (0.12%–16.89%) supports multiple pulses of migration through the Strait. Overall, the results indicate a rate of K2P divergence of 3.2%/MY in molluscs, 5%–5.2%/MY in arthropods, and 3.5%–4.7%/MY in polychaetes. While these rates are considerably higher than the often-adopted 1.4%/MY rate, they are similar to calibrations (3%–5%/MY) in several other studies of marine invertebrates. This upward revision in rates means there is a need both to reevaluate the evolutionary history of marine lineages and to reexamine the impact of prior climatic changes upon the diversification of marine life.","Loeza-Quintana, T.; Carr, C.M.; Khan, T.; Bhatt, Y.A.; Lyon, S.P.; Hebert, P.D.N.; Adamowicz, S.J.",WOS:000465219400011,"Loeza-Quintana, Tzitziki, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1139/gen-2018-0107,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,clock dating; molecular rates; trans-Arctic; biogeographic clock calibration; DNA barcoding,Journal article,,,"Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",Canada,clock dating; molecular rates; trans-Arctic; biogeographic clock calibration; DNA barcoding,ESTIMATING EVOLUTIONARY RATES; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; SOFTWARE PACKAGE; TIME DEPENDENCY; RAPID EVOLUTION; GENERATION TIME; NORTH-ATLANTIC; METABOLIC-RATE; LARGE GENOMES,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Guelph,,Canada,,University,Science

Although mussels are one of the most prominent and frequently studied biological models, the research on their genomic alterations induced by the mixture of two totally different chemicals, is still rare. In present study, local marine mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed in vivo to BaP (53.74 ± 19.79 μg/ L), Pb (2.58 ± 0.11 mg/L) and their mixture for 6 days. The genotoxic damages were assessed by comet assay, micronucleus (MNi) test, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Significantly increased though transitory genomic damage was investigated after the exposure and showed consistency using various detecting methods. Additive genotoxicity was only found after 3 days combined exposure by means of MNi test, suggesting that BaP and Pb may play with alternative biological targets during metabolism and/or interaction with the genome. The geno-stability and the recovery capability were further detected both in vivo and in vitro after challenged by BaP. RAPD results showed coherence in BaP induced genotoxicity, together with timespecific alterations. The genomic instability was found to recover in both in vivo and in vitro exposure scenarios in present study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the genotoxicitiy induced by BaP, Pb and their mixture by multiple detecting techniques. The attempt to utilize model pollutants and marine organism to validate the potential value of RAPD analysis highlighted that it might be a useful tool in the research of genotoxicology, especially on the effect-mechanism interplay at genetic level.","Qu, M.; Ding, J.; Wang, Y.; Chen, S.; Zhang, Y.; Di, Y.",WOS:000456226600064,"Qu, Mengjie, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.066,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mytilus coruscus,Genotoxicity,,Multiple end-points; BaP/Pb; In vivo/vitro experiment,Journal article,,,"Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Inst Marine Biol, Zhoushan 316000, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Genotoxicity; Multiple end-points; BaP/Pb; Mytilus coruscus; In vivo/vitro experiment,TITANIUM-DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES; AMPLIFIED POLYMORPHIC DNA; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; TISSUE-SPECIFIC EXPRESSION; BENZO(A) PYRENE; ANTIOXIDANT RESPONSES; CHROMOSOMAL DAMAGE; ECOLOGICAL RISK; HEAVY-METALS; RAS GENES,Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,Zhejiang Ocean University - Institute of Marine Biology,x,China,,Research institute,Science

The coast is diversified into the categories of bay, cover, gulf, estuaries, and peninsula. Indian coasts are endowed with different ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, coral reefs, sea grass beds, beaches, dunes, salt marshes, and mud flats along its 8100 km long stretch. Marine and coastal ecosystems play an important role in photosynthesis and productivity. The diversity of fauna and flora suggests that the number of species known could be 17,795 or higher in the Indian coastal and marine ecosystems. Of these, 998 species are protected by law as their natural stock is being depleted due to overexploitation. The taxonomy of many of the minor groups, particularly invertebrates including sponges, octocorals, ctenophores, polychaetes, and tunicates, remains a challenge to specialists. As a result, these taxa continue to be inadequately known from the Indian seas. However, considerable knowledge on the taxonomy of groups such as seaweeds, sea grasses, mangroves, scleractinian corals, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals is available in India. Coastal areas have been abruptly used for thousands of years for purposes such as harbors, oil platforms, fishing, recreation, waste dumbing, etc. Deforestation of mangrove forests is common in Southeast Asian countries, which collapses all the associated ecosystems and adversely affects the ocean's physical system like global warming and sea level rise and as a result most of the coastal areas of India is in “Alarming state”. The data provided in this paper explain the status of Indian marine biodiversity and threats to coastal biodiversity. The information disseminated in the paper may be helpful for managerial measures to conserve and rationally utilize our coastal biodiversity.","Raghunathan, C.; Raghuraman, R.; Choudhury, S.",,"Raghunathan, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-810473-6.00012-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Marine biodiversity; Threats; Challenges; Protected animals; Conservation,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There remains a lack of understanding of how artificial structures function as habitat compared to natural substrates, particularly those being lost, such as mangrove prop roots. The objectives of this study were to compare benthic epifaunal communities on artificial structures to those on mangrove prop roots across a large spatial scale and to assess seasonal trends of colonizing species within each habitat. Identified species were also classified as either native or non-native to assess whether artificial structures harbor more non-natives compared to mangroves. Results indicated that community composition differed significantly between habitat types, as did richness and diversity. More species were found and in higher percent cover on artificial structures. Only a few species were dominant throughout the study and were present in both habitats, and these species varied in their abundance across sites and time. Colonization at all sites was continuous throughout each season, particularly for those dominant species. Non-native species richness made up 30-50% of the community composition in each of the habitats and was significantly higher on artificial structures. Overall, artificial structures appeared to provide a functional, unique surface for both dominant and rare species and could act as a buffer to biodiversity loss in mangroves, a globally threatened habitat.","Janiak, D.S.; Osman, R.W.; Freeman, C.J.; Paul, V.J.",WOS:000452891600006,"Janiak, Dean, D.S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps12783,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Artificial structures · Mangroves · Indian River Lagoon · Non-native · Epifauna,Journal article,,,"Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA.",USA,Artificial structures; Mangroves; Indian River Lagoon; Non-native; Epifauna,SUBTIDAL EPIBIOTA; URBAN STRUCTURES; HABITAT; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; INVASION; DYNAMICS; FAUNA; EUTROPHICATION; ASSEMBLAGES,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Smithsonian Institution - Smithsonian Marine Station,x,USA,,Research institute,Science

Several studies have suggested that Ponto-Caspian taxa are euryhaline and mightbe able to adapt rapidly to changing salinity conditions, and therefore may be more successful colonizers than species from other regions.To determine the realized niche in the native and introduced habitats of Ponto-Caspian invaders and to assess whether they have expandedtheir salinity tolerance during the invasion process, we conducted a literature search to assess the salinity ranges of 55 Ponto-Caspianspecies in their native and introduced ranges. Our results confirmed that the majority of those species occupied a wide range of salinityin their native and introduced habitats. Approximately 50% of species were reported from both freshwater and brackish habitats (0–18 PSU) in their native region, occupying a salinity range of at least 10 PSU difference. In general, the number of species tended to declineas salinity increased in both native and introduced habitats. More than 90% of Ponto-Caspian invaders occupied freshwater (< 0–0.5 PSU) habitats, while 18% did not occur above 18 PSU. Overall, 46% of species were reported from a narrower salinity range in their introducedcompared to their native region. Consequently, our study revealed significantly broader salinity ranges in native compared to introducedhabitats. As our results suggest that the majority of Ponto-Caspian invaders occupy freshwater and brackish habitats in their native region, the recent numerous invasions of freshwater and brackish areas by these species should not be a surprise.

In this study, 52 studies conducted between 1991 and 2018 in Turkish waters were reviewed to assess the status of chondrichthyan species as by-catch. Geographic coverage was grouped as; Black Sea (the number of studies 5), Sea of Marmara (6), Aegean Sea (25), and Levantine Sea (16). Results showed that there were differences in by-catch amounts when sharks, rays and chimaeras were compared according to geographical grouping. When by-catch ratios of listed species were analyzed it showed that almost half of the by-catch was comprised of small spotted catshark, <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> (Linnaeus, 1758), followed by blackmouth catshark, <i>Galeus melastomus</i> Rafinesque, 1810. In case of rays, the most common species of by-catch was thornback ray, <i>Raja clavata</i> Linnaeus, 1758, followed by common stingray, <i>Dasyatis pastinaca</i> (Linnaeus, 1758). Among all reported species concerned, 9 were Critically Endangered, 8 Endangered, 7 Vulnerable, 13 Near Threatened, 8 Least concern, 9 were Data Deficient, according to IUCN Red List, corresponding to half of the Turkish cartilaginous fauna.

Belgian Science Policy Office/BRAIN-be (Belgian Research Action through Interdisciplinary Networks): Brussels.  104 pp.","Context : Long-term quality checked and integrated datasets for the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) are essential to detect changes in this complex ecosystem and support policy related decisions.Objectives: - Compile and safeguard quality checked, intercalibrated and integrated datasets and make them publicly accessible for further research and policy purposes.- Improve or develop methods and protocols to assess and interpret environmental change in the BPNS and compare trends with neighbouring areas.- Provide support and advice for policy related decisions and legal measures, like MSFD and OSPAR.Conclusions: A scheme with data management tools has been worked out for efficient data flow throughout the project. The scheme, including the mandatory metadata fields and standardization, can be used as a guideline for future projects. Inventories of datasources, projects and data-originators were compiled and the final datasets are available via the central dataportal. Even after compiling and quality checking the long-term datasets, the scientists had to consider some limitations, like changing methodologies and low data resolution, and incorporate these into their trend analyses procedures. Some remarkable environmental changes over time were observed. Model results of the contaminants showed decreasing trends for heavy metals and PCBs. Zn concentrations, however, were found increasing in marine sediments while As concentrations were found increasing in groyne mussels. Nearby the port of Zeebrugge and the mouth of the Scheldt, PCB concentrations were found slightly increasing again over the last decade. The study on eutrophication showed that nutrient (N, P) riverine concentrations and loads have decreased continuously from the end of the 1980‟s to now. However, this did not result in a comparable decrease of marine nutrient concentrations. No clear long-term trend effect was observed on in situ chlorophyll a concentrations following the nutrient decrease. However, a clear change in chlorophyll a phenology followed the increase in sea surface temperature in the period. Furthermore, biomass, seasonality and structure of diatom and dinoflagellate communities were compared between the 1970s and 2000s for the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS), derived from the newly established Belgian Phytoplankton Database. Distinct changes were observed: changes in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass and shift of fulcrum; changes in community structure, with a trend towards seasonal homogenization in the diatom community; increased occurrence of harmful diatom (Pseudo-nitzschia) and dinoflagellate (e.g. Prorocentrum) genera. The observed changes correlate well with overall increases in temperature and changes in nutrient loads and ratios.And finally, for acidification, pH data reveal an increasing trend from the mid-70‟s to the mid-80‟s and a decrease of pH from the mid-80‟s onwards that seems consistent with changes in primary production patterns. The comparison of CH4 concentrations obtained in 1990 and 2016, showed a decreasing trend consistent with alleviation of eutrophication in the area.Based on the outcome of this successful project, the partners defined various recommendations regarding future monitoring strategies for policy makers.","Lagring, R.; De Witte, B.; Bekaert, K.; Borges, A.V.; Desmit, X.; Le, H.M.; Nohe, A.; Sabbe, K.; Strobbe, F.; Tyberghein, L.; Vandenberghe, T.; Van der Zande, D.",,"Borges, Alberto, A.V.",Ulg,,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Contamination, ""Eutrophication""",,ocean acidification; Southern North Sea; long-term trends,Reports,Final report,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we evaluated the suitability and robustness of an eDNA-based approach for the detection of the crayfish plague agent <i>Aphanomyces astaci</i> and assessed the capacity of this new method as practical tool for bioassessments in freshwater. The approach was examined in three case studies: case study A tested its use as biomonitoring tool to determine the range and density of <i>A. astaci</i>- infected crayfish populations in three different water systems. Case study B focussed on the identification of possible A. astaci infection sources, here an aquafarm. For case study C we assessed a migration front of infected crayfish near a native crayfish area. The eDNA-based detection allowed to infer local patterns and distribution limits of crayfish plague occurrence. Spore estimates in eDNA samples correlated significantly with catch per unit effort values and pathogen loads of captured <i>A. astaci</i>- positive crayfish obtained from trapping in running waters. We also showed that spore concentrations are detectable up to three kilometres downstream from hot spot areas of infected crayfish. By identifying a possible <i>A. astaci</i> entry point and migration front eDNA proved suitable for the detection of <i>A. astaci</i> spores at low population densities and/or pathogen levels of infected crayfish. The study provides conclusive evidence for the suitability of the eDNA approach as a tool for risk assessment and large-scale monitoring of <i>A. astaci</i> for a wide range of practical conservation issues of indigenous crayfish species.","Wittwer, C.; Stoll, S.; Thines, M.; Nowak, C.",WOS:000463042000003,"Wittwer, Claudia, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10530-018-1886-x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852)","Aphanomyces astaci, ""Risk management""",,Environmental DNA; Density dependence; Biomonitoring,Journal article,,,"Nat Hist Museum Frankfurt, Conservat Genet Grp, Clamecystr 12, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany.",Germany,Environmental DNA; Aphanomyces astaci; Pacifastacus leniusculus; Density dependence; Biomonitoring; Risk management,ENVIRONMENTAL DNA EDNA; INVASIVE SIGNAL CRAYFISH; APHANOMYCES-ASTACI; PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS; ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS; WATER; BIODIVERSITY; PARASITE; CONSERVATION; LIMITATIONS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Natural History Museum Frankfurt,,,,,

In spring, when nutrients are abundant, small diatoms such as <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> pseudodelicatissima, with a “rapid growth strategy”, prevail. In late spring and early summer, when N is low and P and Si are high, coccolithophorids such as <i>Emiliania huxhleyi</i> dominate, thanks to an “affinity growth strategy”. Large diatoms, especially <i>Pseudosolenia calcar-avis</i>, dominate in summer and autumn, when their “storage growth strategy” allows the exploitation of discontinuous upwelling of nutrients. These seasonal changes of dominant species influence the structure of the food web.","Silkin, V.A.; Pautova, L.; Giordano, M.; Chasovnikov, V.; Vostokov, S.V.; Podymov, O.I.; Pakhomova, S.V.; Moskalenko, L.V.",WOS:000457512500034,"Vostokov, S.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.11.042,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Blooms, ""Ecological succession"", ""Nutrients"", ""Phytoplankton""",,Ecological stoichiometry; wind,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Lab Fisiol Alghe & Piante, Ancona, Italy.",Italy,Blooms; Ecological succession; Nutrients; Ecological stoichiometry; Phytoplankton; Wind,CTENOPHORE MNEMIOPSIS-LEIDYI; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CELL-SIZE; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; COASTAL WATERS; PEG-MODEL; DYNAMICS; VARIABILITY; MECHANISMS,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marche Polytechnic University - Department of Life and Environment,x,,,,

Modern shell collecting encompasses a wide range of molluscan families and species, including numerous bivalve taxa, and collections may be developed via a range of methods including self-collection, purchase from specialised dealers, exchange or from older collections. The fundamentals of building and maintaining a scientifically-valid specimen shell collection are discussed, including the role of conchological organisations in promoting shell collecting and increasing awareness of the activity. The International shell trade can be locally significant, and some trends in shell collecting are presented, with a particular focus on the most popular bivalve families and online specimen-shell sales. The issues of sustainable harvesting, regulation and enforcement are discussed. However, the importance of shell collections and collectors in relation to molluscan taxonomy is also presented, as is their relevance to environmental awareness and potential role in enabling people to better interact with and understand the marine environment. A number of important and highly collectable bivalve species are presented as examples.","Duncan, P.F.; Ghys, A.",,"Ghys, Arne, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-96776-9_20,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,"Collections, ""History"", ""Taxonomy"", ""Trade""",,Conchology; Bivalves; Shell collecting; Scientific value ,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first record of parasitism by this genus on mesopelagic myctophid fish. The new species is easily distinguished from other congeners in: (1) the presence of a conical process anterior to the rostrum; (2) the secondary elongation of the first pedigerous somite; (3) the incorporation of the third and fourth pedigerous somites into the trunk; (4) the unilobate maxillule bearing two unequal apical setae; (5) the lack of any processes on the first segment of the maxilla. Four morphological patterns of the cephalothorax, neck and anterior parts of the trunk can be found in the genus. We infer that initial colonization of a mesopelagic myctophid fish as host is likely to have occurred when the diurnally-migrating myctophid host was feeding in near-surface waters at night and was exposed to infective stages of <i>Peniculus</i>.","Ohtsuka, S.; Nishikawa, J.; Boxshall, G.A.",WOS:000451063000003,"Ohtsuka, Susumu, S."," Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Setouchi Field Sci Ctr, Takehara Marine Sci Stn, Hiroshima 7250024, Japan.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1051/parasite/2018057,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Myctophidae, ""Peniculus"", ""Pennellidae""",Colonization,,diel vertical migration; mesopelagic,Journal article,,,"Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Seotuchi Field Sci Ctr, Takehara Stn, 5-8-1 Minato Machi, Takehara, Hiroshima 7250024, Japan.",Japan,colonization; diel vertical migration; mesopelagic; Myctophidae; Peniculus; Pennellidae,PENNELLIDAE COPEPODA; MARINE FISHES; VON NORDMANN; REDESCRIPTION; KOREA,Parasitology,Parasitology,Hiroshima University,x,Japan,,University,Science
