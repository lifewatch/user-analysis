The interval studied includes the upper part of the Pliocene Productive Series and overlying Plio-Pleistocene Akchagylian (Akchagyl) and Apsheronian (Apsheron) regional stages. Productive Series sediments were deposited in a closed fluvio-lacustrine basin, isolated from any marine influence. The onset of Akchagyl deposition is marked by a lithological change associated with a significant flooding event that, at its maximum extent, reached the Sea of Azov and into present-day Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia. At the Jeirankechmez locality, the lowermost beds of the Akchagyl contain predominantly freshwater assemblages with very minimal marine or brackish content showing that the onset of Akchagyl deposition was not a marine induced event. Reworked Mesozoic palynomorphs occur frequently in this lowermost interval, including the reworked pollen taxa <i>Aquilapollenites-Triprojectus</i> that were eroded from the north or north-east.  Significant marine influence is evident ca. 30 m above the base of the Akchagyl in the studied outcrop, marked by the ‘<i>Cassidulina</i> Beds’ which contain a distinct but low diversity assemblage of foraminifera that occurs widely and can be correlated in many parts of the greater Caspian region. Dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) in the marine interval include frequent specimens very similar to <i>Algidasphaeridium capillatum</i> (Matsuoka and Bujak), a species only previously recorded from the northern Bering Sea. The combined evidence from these dinocysts and foraminifera suggests that a marine (i.e. seaway) connection existed briefly between the Arctic Ocean and the Caspian Sea at the very end of the Pliocene.  Re-examination of core material from the Adriatic Sea shows that <i>Cassidulina reniforme</i> (Nørvang) was present in the Mediterranean during and shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum. The possibility that the end Pliocene marine incursion came from the Mediterranean via the Black Sea region to the Caspian Sea cannot be entirely ruled out but is considered unlikely. Biometric analyses are applied to obtain a better understanding of the palaeoenvironmental significance of the assemblages dominated by cassidulinids.  An interval >300 m thick is assigned to the Apsheron regional stage on the basis of predominantly brackish ostracod and dinocyst associations. The dinocysts are of ‘Peri-Paratethyan’ affinity and closely resemble species first described from Miocene and Pliocene sediments in the Pannonian and Dacic basins of Eastern Europe.

It is a well-known part of the Asian diet with health benefits, which have been associated, among others, to the high levels of <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-3 and <span class=""html-italic"">n-</span>6 fatty acids in this red alga. However, other highly valued lipids of <span class=""html-italic"">Porphyra</span> are polar lipids that remain largely undescribed and can have both nutritional value and bioactivity, thus could contribute to the valorization of this seaweed. In this context, the present work aims to identify the lipidome of two life cycle stages of the Atlantic species <span class=""html-italic"">Porphyra dioica</span>: the early life stage conchocelis produced in an indoor-nursery, and young blades produced outdoors using an integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) framework. Both the blades (gametophyte) and conchocelis (sporophyte) are commercialized in the food and cosmetics sectors. Liquid chromatography coupled to Q–Exactive high resolution-mass spectrometry (MS) platform was used to gain insight into the lipidome of these species. Our results allowed the identification of 110 and 100 lipid molecular species in the lipidome of the blade and conchocelis, respectively. These lipid molecular species were distributed as follows (blade/conchocelis): 14/15 glycolipids (GLs), 93/79 phospholipids (PLs), and 3/6 betaine lipids. Both life stages displayed a similar profile of GLs and comprised 20:4(<span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-6) and 20:5(<span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-3) fatty acids that contribute to <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-3 and <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-6 fatty acid pool recorded and rank among the molecular species with higher potential bioactivity. PLs’ profile was different between the two life stages surveyed, mainly due to the number and relative abundance of molecular species. This finding suggests that differences between both life stages were more likely related with shifts in the lipids of extraplastidial membranes rather than in plastidial membranes. PLs contained <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-6 and <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-3 precursors and in both life stages of <span class=""html-italic"">Porphyra dioica</span> the <span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-6/<span class=""html-italic"">n</span>-3 ratio recorded was less than 2, highlighting the potential benefits of using these life stages in human diet to prevent chronic diseases. Atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes of blades (0.85 and 0.49, respectively) and conchocelis (0.34 and 0.30, respectively) are much lower than those reported for other Rhodophyta, which highlights their potential application as food or as functional ingredients.

In this work, the relevance of the ecological groups that macrofaunal molluscs are assigned according to their sensitivity or tolerance to environmental disturbance was examined under the scope of the RCP 8.5 severe emissions scenario. The effects of climate change were more profound on species that are indicative of a specific suite of climatic conditions regarding temperature and salinity. Significant loss of habitat suitability was observed for the tolerant species <i>Corbula gibba</i> and <i>Abra prismatica</i> whereas the sensitive species <i>Moerella donacina</i> was least affected. In contrast, an overall expansion of the distributional potential was observed for the sensitive species <i>Flexopecten hyalinus</i> as newly suitable habitats are formed.

This is a “Corrected Version” (not a revision), which can serve as an on-going historical case example because it is now updatable with future time scales. Both macroevolutionary and biostratigraphic communities are now equipped with an enduring phylogenetic database of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminiferal morphospecies and lineages for which both graphics and content can be visualised together. Key to maintaining the currency of the trees has been specification of time scales for sources of stratigraphic ranges; these scales then locate the range dates within the calibration series. Some ranges or their sources have undergone mostly minor corrections or amendments. Links between lineage and morphospecies trees have been introduced to improve consistency and transparency in timing within the trees. Also, Aze & others’ dual employment of morphospecies and lineage concepts is further elaborated here, given misunderstandings that have ensued. Features displayed on the trees include options for line styles for additional categories for range extensions or degrees of support for ancestor–descendant proposals; these have been applied to a small number of instances as an encouragement to capture more nuanced data in the future. In addition to labeling of eco- and morpho-groups on both trees, genus labels can be attached to the morphospecies tree to warn of polyphyletic morphogenera, and the lineage codes have been decoded to ease their recognition. However, it is the mouse-over pop-ups that provide the greatest opportunity to embed supporting information in the trees. They include details for stratigraphic ranges and their recalibration steps, positions relative to the standard planktonic-foraminiferal zonation, and applications as datums, as well as mutual listings between morphospecies and lineages which ease the tracing of their interrelated contents.

Although scantly studied, this species is known to live in striking symbiosis with a colonial sea anemone that the hermit can stretch back and forth like a blanket over its cephalic shield and part of cephalothoracic appendages, and thus the common name “blanket-crab”. During a study of paguroid collections obtained during recent French-sponsored biodiversity campaigns in the Indo-West Pacific, numerous specimens assignable to <i>Paguropsis</i> were encountered. Analysis and comparison with types and other historical specimens deposited in various museums revealed the existence of five undescribed species. Discovery of these new species, together with the observation of anatomical characters previously undocumented or poorly described, including coloration, required a revision of the genus <i>Paguropsis</i>. The name <i>Chlaenopagurus andersoni</i> Alcock & McArdle, 1901, considered by Alcock (1905) a junior synonym of <i>P. typica</i>, proved to be a valid species and is resurrected as <i>P. andersoni</i> (Alcock, 1899). In two of the new species, the shape of the gills, length/width of exopod of maxilliped 3, width and shape of sternite XI (of pereopods 3), and armature of the dactyls and fixed fingers of the chelate pereopods 4, were found to be characters so markedly different from <i>P. typica</i> and other species discovered that a new genus for them, <i>Paguropsina</i> gen. n., is justified.

However, the use of fine‐mesh nets sparked issues on conservation and overfishing. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the catch per unit effort and catch composition of filter nets in Jordan, Guimaras during the summer season of 2016. The total length of the gear was 23–40&nbsp;m with a mouth opening of 11&nbsp;m&nbsp;×&nbsp;11&nbsp;m. The cod end had the smallest mesh size (3&nbsp;mm) and was provided with a non‐return valve.

Horse mackerels have been targeted in recent projects, in a number of countries that exploit this fish resource (Argentina, Chile, European and Mediterranean countries, North America), with a view of using parasites to define population structure, in conjunction with other methods and techniques, to achieve a better understanding of fish stocks and to minimize risks of localized extinctions. However, information on the occurrence of parasites in this fish genus is scattered through a substantial number of scientific journals, some of them of difficult access.

This work aims to characterize the biofacies based on benthic foraminifera preserved in sediments of the 2-BG-1-RJ well core drilled in the Rio Paraiba do Sul Deltaic Complex, at the south of the current river mouth, located in the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes (RJ). The analyzed samples are located at the top of the well core, ranging from 40.50 m to 10.50 m, and were chosen because that core interval was described as a succession of Estuary (PGH′)/Marine facies (QP’). Two biofacies were defined, respectively: QP′ characterized by shelf miliolids and PGH′, characterized by <i>Pararotalia cananeiaensis, Gavelinopsis praegeri, Haynesina germanica</i> and <i>Hanzawaia nitidula</i>. Those species suggest estuarine environment with fluvial influence in the base and marine influence from the middle to the top of the core. Correlating the results of the biofacies with the sedimentary facies, two falling and one rising relative sea level are inferred.

We analysed the distribution of 548 species belonging to 8 phyla sampled in 137 assemblages in subtidal rocky areas located around Brittany, Western France. We applied the Index of Relative Rarity, a flexible method which fits rarity weights to species depending on their respective phyla. We found only weak congruence in rarity patterns among phyla, which prevented any attempt to identify surrogate phyla. This finding has important implications for the conservation of subtidal rocky habitats as it means that there is no shortcut to monitor their rarity: working on a subset of phyla would imply a biased evaluation of biodiversity.

Partial sequences of two mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase 2, 12S rRNA gene) and two nuclear genes (isotype 1 β tubulin gene including two introns, internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were obtained from morphologically identified specimens of <em>Cooperia pectinata</em>, <em>Cooperia punctata</em> and <em>Cooperia spatulata</em> as well as from larvae of pure <em>Cooperia oncophora</em> and <em>C</em>. <em>punctata</em> laboratory isolates.

Part 1 is encyclopedic in scope, collating information on the >50 known metabolites isolated from crinoids, including their taxonomic source, collection location, chemical structure and biological activities. During the compilation of this data, two distinct themes emerged. Firstly, there is little variation in the class of metabolites produced by crinoids, irrespective of their species or geographic origin. Secondly, the complete and unambiguous assignment of crinoid metabolite structures has been, in many cases, a difficult task. This has been due to a lack of spectroscopic technology available in the past, the presence of proton-poor chemical structures, or both.

The characterisation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from sediment and seawater using metabarcoding offers a powerful molecular lens to observe marine biota and provides a series of ‘snapshots’ across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms. Using these next-generation tools and downstream analytical innovations including machine learning sequence assignment algorithms and co-occurrence network analyses, we examined how anthropogenic pressures may have impacted marine biodiversity on subtropical coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan. Based on 18 S ribosomal RNA, but not ITS2 sequence data due to inconsistent amplification for this marker, as well as proxies for anthropogenic disturbance, we show that eukaryotic richness at the family level significantly increases with medium and high levels of disturbance. This change in richness coincides with compositional changes, a decrease in connectedness among taxa, an increase in fragmentation of taxon co-occurrence networks, and a shift in indicator taxa. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the ability of eDNA to act as a barometer of disturbance and provide an exemplar of how biotic networks and coral reefs may be impacted by anthropogenic activities.","Dibattista, J.D.; Reimer, J.D.; Stat, M.; Masucci, G.D.; Biondi, P.; De Brauwer, M.; Wilkinson, S.P.; Chariton, A.A.; Bunce, M.",WOS:000540463800004,"Reimer, James Davis, J.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-64858-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Australian Museum, Res Inst, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia.",Australia,,CORAL-REEFS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; DIVERSITY; OKINAWA; MARINE; COMMUNITIES; ISLAND; ASSOCIATIONS; ASSEMBLAGES; DISCHARGE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Australian Museum,x,Australia,,Museum,Science

It has been described in nine and three families of marine and freshwater mussels, respectively, including the European margaritiferids and unionids. Among the 16 freshwater species of Unionida inhabiting Europe, DUI has been described in 9 species of dioecious mussels and was absent from a single hermaphroditic species and from secondary hermaphroditic specimens. The DUI freshwater mussels include two vastly genetically different mitochondrial genomes: maternal (F genome) and paternal (M genome), which coexist within the same specimen but in different tissues. The F genome is present in all female tissues and somatic male tissues. It is inherited in the typical, maternal, manner. Conversely, the M genome is located primarily in the male gonads and generative cells, and is inherited paternally. Dioecious Unionidae display unique characteristics that have been interrelated for over 200 million years: a high fidelity of the transmission of the F and M genomes in DUI and two paths of spermatogenesis–the typical path that produces sperm cells containing mitochondria with the F genome and the atypical path that produces sperm cells with the M genome. The mitogenomes of freshwater mussels display unique features that are not present in any other animal, that is, an additional, gender‐specific gene and an elongated cox2 gene occurring exclusively in the M genome. These features mean that the mitochondria, in addition to their basic function of producing energy, also may take part in determining sex in these dioecious organisms.","Soroka, M.",WOS:000532591300006,"Soroka, Marianna, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jzs.12381,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Unionidae,,,"doubly uniparental inheritance, gender-specific gene, Margaritiferidae, mitochondrial DNA",Journal article,,,"Univ Szczecin, Inst Biol, Szczecin, Poland.",Poland,doubly uniparental inheritance; gender-specific gene; Margaritiferidae; mitochondrial DNA; Unionidae,CHINESE POND MUSSEL; TISSUE-SPECIFIC EXPRESSION; SINANODONTA-WOODIANA LEA; OXIDASE-II GENE; BIVALVIA-UNIONIDAE; COMPLETE SEQUENCES; BLUE MUSSEL; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION; PHYLOGENETIC UTILITY,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,University of Szczecin,,Poland,,University,Science

A large and growing number of studies and data repositories are now available on-line. However, manually integrating different datasets is a tedious and grueling process leading to a rising need for automated integration tools. A key challenge in oceanographic data integration is to map between data sources that have no common schema and that were collected, processed, and analyzed using different methodologies. Concurrently, artificial agents are becoming increasingly adept at extracting knowledge from text and using domain ontologies to integrate and align data. Here, we deconstruct the process of ocean science data integration, providing a detailed description of its three phases: discover, merge, and evaluate/correct. In addition, we identify the key missing tools and underutilized information sources currently limiting the automation of the integration process. The efforts to address these limitations should focus on (i) development of artificial intelligence-based tools for assisting ocean scientists in aligning their schema with existing ontologies when organizing their measurements in datasets; (ii) extension and refinement of conceptual coverage of – and conceptual alignment between – existing ontologies, to better fit the diverse and multidisciplinary nature of ocean science; (iii) creation of ocean-science-specific entity resolution benchmarks to accelerate the development of tools utilizing ocean science terminology and nomenclature; (iv) creation of ocean-science-specific schema matching and mapping benchmarks to accelerate the development of matching and mapping tools utilizing semantics encoded in existing vocabularies and ontologies; (v) annotation of datasets, and development of tools and benchmarks for the extraction and categorization of data quality and preprocessing descriptions from scientific text; and (vi) creation of large-scale word embeddings trained upon ocean science literature to accelerate the development of information extraction and matching tools based on artificial intelligence.","Sagi, T.; Lehahn, Y.; Bar, K.",WOS:000534604000001,"Lehahn, Yoav, Y.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1525/elementa.418,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Artificial intelligence, ""Data integration"", ""Oceanography""",,Ontologies,Journal article,,,"Univ Haifa, Charney Sch Marine Sci, Dept Marine Geosci, Haifa, Israel.",Israel,Data Integration; Artificial Intelligence; Ontologies; Oceanography,DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; GLOBAL OCEAN; BIOMASS; WEB; INFORMATION; ABUNDANCE; DESIGN,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Weizmann Institute of Science - Department of Biological Structure,x,Israel,,University,Science

While the impacts of aquaculture on the taxonomic structure of macro- and — to a lesser extent — meiofauna, have been widely studied, the functional changes of these communities remain relatively unknown. The recent development of biological trait analysis (BTA) has made it possible to produce information about how ecosystem functioning could change across specific terrestrial or aquatic system. In the present study, we used a BTA in parallel with standard taxonomic analysis to evaluate how well the two approaches detected the potential influence of juvenile oyster culture on the benthic community in the French Mediterranean Thau Lagoon. Two sites were sampled under farm structures and compared with two reference sites beyond the influence of farming. This study is the first detailed parallel description of macro- and meiofauna (nematodes). A total of 118 and 41 taxa were determined for macrofauna and nematodes respectively. Some taxa were more abundant or exclusively observed under farm structures such as <em>Chaetozone gibber</em> and <em>Neanthes acuminata</em> for macrofauna and <em>Daptonema fallax</em> and <em>Anticoma eberthi</em> for nematodes.</p><p id=""sp0015"">Overall, our results indicate that biological traits and functional indices both detected the impact of shellfish culture on benthic assemblages, whereas macrofauna taxonomic indices revealed no difference. Our results thus suggest that trophic and ecological groups are particularly good indicators of the effects of shellfish culture. This study confirms the relevance of the functional approach, and more generally of multi-index approaches, to detect the influence of aquaculture on benthic communities. Further work is required to test multiple traits in different regions and under different systems, but this work paves the way for environmental impact assessment using a trait based approach.","Lacoste, E.; Boufahja, F.; Pelaprat, C.; Le Gall, P.; Berteaux, T.; Messiaen, G.; Mortreux, S.; Oheix, J.; Ouisse, V.; Roque d'Orbcastel, E.; Gaertner-Mazouni, N.; Richard, M.",WOS:000561438700036,"Lacoste, Élise, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106462,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Aquaculture, ""Meiofauna""",,Environmental impact assessment; Benthic indicators; Trait based approach; Macrofauna,Journal article,,,"Stn Ifremer Sete, Ave Jean Monnet, F-34200 Sete, France.",France,Environmental impact assessment; Aquaculture; Benthic indicators; Trait based approach; Macrofauna; Meiofauna,LIVING MARINE NEMATODES; MUSSEL CULTURE; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; MORTALITY EPISODE; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACT; ASSEMBLAGES; TRAITS; SEA,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

University of Southampton: Southampton. 249 pp.","Macroecology provides a framework for understanding how local- and regional-scale processes interact, allowing us to understand how the biological and ecological traits of individual species influence large-scale patterns in diversity. The majority of macroecological studies to date have been centred on the terrestrial environment where large databases on species ranges, body size and associated environmental variables are readily available. Due to the inaccessibility of the deep sea, coupled with its relatively recent exploration, deep sea macroecology is the least represented within marine macroecology as a whole. Jellyfish, a significant constituent of the zooplankton, form important and often conspicuous components of marine ecosystems. Jellyfish studies covering large spatial scales are mostly focused on the shallow-water, bloom-forming species that have more apparent anthropogenic interactions, such as Aurelia aurita. The structural simplicity of jellyfish permits the rapid adaptation to changing environments. Plasticity in traits such as feeding, physiology, reproductive output, somatic growth and size are common; and as such allow populations to persist. The coronate medusae Periphylla periphylla Péron and Lesueur, 1810 and Atolla spp. are the most recognised deep-sea jellyfish, and both have cosmopolitan distributions. Little remains known about these genera beyond the early descriptions of the species, particularly relating to their macroecology and the expression of plastic traits according to varying environments. This study presents a large volume of morphological data using museum collections genera in order to better describe morphological variation on a global scale and to examine what factors might drive such variation.","Hardinge, G.",,"Hardinge, Graihagh, G.",,,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

These metabolites could help satisfy the increasing demand for alternative sources of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, cosmeceuticals, food, feed, and novel bio-based products. In addition, marine biomass itself can serve as the source material for the production of various bulk commodities (e.g., biofuels, bioplastics, biomaterials). The sustainable exploitation of marine bio-resources and the development of biomolecules and polymers are also known as the growing field of marine biotechnology. Up to now, over 35,000 natural products have been characterized from marine organisms, but many more are yet to be uncovered, as the vast diversity of biota in the marine systems remains largely unexplored. Since marine biotechnology is still in its infancy, there is a need to create effective, operational, inclusive, sustainable, transnational and transdisciplinary networks with a serious and ambitious commitment for knowledge transfer, training provision, dissemination of best practices and identification of the emerging technological trends through science communication activities. A collaborative (net)work is today compelling to provide innovative solutions and products that can be commercialized to contribute to the circular bioeconomy. This perspective article highlights the importance of establishing such collaborative frameworks using the example of Ocean4Biotech, an Action within the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) that connects all and any stakeholders with an interest in marine biotechnology in Europe and beyond.","Rotter, Ana; Bacu, Ariola; Barbier, Michèle; Bertoni, Francesco; Bones, Atle M.; Cancela, M.

However, no globally applicable end-to-end solution has been published to transform raw AIS messages into economically meaningful, policy-relevant indicators of international trade. Our paper proposes and tests a set of algorithms to fill this gap. We build indicators of world seaborne trade using raw data from the radio signals that the global vessel fleet emits for navigational safety purposes. We leverage different machine-learning techniques to identify port boundaries, construct port-to-port voyages, and estimate trade volumes at the world, bilateral and within-country levels. Our methodology achieves a good fit with official trade statistics for many countries and for the world in aggregate. We also show the usefulness of our approach for sectoral analyses of crude oil trade, and for event studies such as Hurricane Maria and the effect of measures taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Going forward, ongoing refinements of our algorithms, additional data on vessel characteristics, and country-specific knowledge should help improve the performance of our general approach for several country cases.","Cerdeiro, D.A.; Komaromi, A.; Liu, Y.; Saeed, M.",,"Liu, Yang, Y.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an improved understanding of TC track climatology is essential, given that TCs are one of the most critical natural hazards in the southwest Pacific (SWP) region. We examine the historical variability of TC tracks within the SWP over the last 70 years (1948–2017) using 6‐hourly track data obtained from the South Pacific Enhanced Archive of Tropical Cyclones (SPEArTC) database. A probabilistic clustering technique is applied to separate TC tracks into distinct groups in order to assess the primary cyclone trajectories for the region and its relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). TC tracks are also classified into four sinuosity categories: straight, recurving, sinuous and highly sinuous; and their spatial and temporal characteristics subsequently analysed. The results of the cluster analysis identified five optimal groups of TC tracks, four of which exhibited southeast propagation, except for the southwest moving tracks in Cluster 5. Temporally, significant trends were observed over the last seven decades, with Clusters 1, 3 and 4 becoming less frequent with a substantial increase in the occurrence of Cluster 2 tracks (representing TCs east of dateline), a geometry favoured by El Niño conditions. Further, the sinuosity analysis revealed continued dominance of straight TCs within the eastern SWP with a tendency of encountering TCs of other morphology types. Conversely, the western SWP region is typically exposed to highly sinuous tracks. We also observed a significant decrease (increase) in TCs with straight and quasi‐straight (highly sinuous) tracks, particularly during the last decade. These findings suggest that combined cluster analysis and TC track sinuosity analysis is an important tool in generalising the TC track regimes, refining predicted trajectories and understanding impacts on SWP island nations.","Sharma, K.K.; Magee, A.D.; Verdon-Kidd, D.C.",WOS:000535007900001,"Sharma, Krishneel, K.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/joc.6636,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Newcastle, GG03 Earth Sci Bldg,Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Australia,Cluster Analysis; ENSO; Sinuosity; southwest Pacific; SPEArTC; Tropical Cyclone tracks,LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; TYPHOON TRACKS; PART I; ENSO; CLASSIFICATION; CYCLOGENESIS; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATOLOGY; SINUOSITY,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Newcastle University,,UK,,University,Science

We investigated the utility of eDNA metabarcoding as a high‐resolution, multitrophic biomonitoring tool at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Australia (CKI)—a remote tropical coral reef atoll situated within the eastern Indian Ocean. Metabarcoding assays targeting the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and CO1 genes, as well as the 18S rRNA nuclear gene, were applied to 252 surface seawater samples collected from 42 sites within a 140&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area. Our assays successfully detected a wide range of bony fish and elasmobranchs (244 taxa), crustaceans (88), molluscs (37) and echinoderms (7). Assemblage composition varied significantly between sites, reflecting habitat partitioning across the island ecosystem and demonstrating the localisation of eDNA signals, despite extensive tidal and oceanic movements. In addition, we document putative new occurrence records for 46 taxa and compare the efficiency of our eDNA approach to visual survey techniques at CKI. Our study demonstrates the utility of a multimarker metabarcoding approach in capturing multitrophic biodiversity across an entire coral reef atoll and sets an important baseline for ongoing monitoring and management.","West, K.M.; Stat, M.; Harvey, E.S.; Skepper, C.L.; Dibattista, J.D.; Richards, Z.T.; Travers, M.J.; Newman, S.J.; Bunce, M.",WOS:000517477700001,"Harvey, Euan, E.S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/mec.15382,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"environmental DNA, whole-ecosystem, multi-trophic, island reef, biodiversity, monitoring",Journal article,,,"Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Trace & Environm DNA TrEnD Lab, Bentley, WA, Australia.",Australia,biodiversity; environmental DNA; island reef; monitoring; multitrophic; whole-ecosystem,COCOS KEELING ISLANDS; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; CHRISTMAS ISLAND; FISH KILL; BIODIVERSITY; CRUSTACEA; BRACHYURA; RECORDS,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Curtin University - School of Molecular and Life Scieces - Department of Environment and Agriculture - TrEnD Lab (Trace & Environmental DNA),x,,,,

The primary finding from this study is that the European national policies and legislation addressing OA is at best uncoordinated. Although OA is acknowledged at the higher levels of governance, its status as an environmental challenge is greatly diluted at the European Union Member State level. As a notable exception within the EEA, Norway seems to have a proactive approach towards legislative frameworks and research aimed towards further understanding OA. On the other hand, there was a complete lack of, or inadequate reporting in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive by the majority of the EU Member States, with the exception of Italy and the Netherlands. We argue that the problems associated with OA and the solutions needed to address it are unique and cannot be bundled together with traditional climate change responses and measures.

The main goal of this review was to identify ecotoxicology studies published that were done in PICTs. Four major gaps were identified: i) a quantitative gap, with low number of studies published on the PICTs; ii) a geographic gap, where ecotoxicology studies have unevenly covered the different PICTs; iii) a temporal gap, as no biological effect monitoring study has so far been published for the PICTs; and, iv) a pollutants gap, as all of the PICTs studies focused mainly on environmental monitoring studying on average two types of pollutants (heavy metals and pesticides) per PICT only. We suggest, therefore, the potential risk to the marine environment to be estimated by assessing the fate of pollutants via chemical and biological effect monitoring.","Varea, R.; Piovano, S.; Ferreira, M.",WOS:000539160000037,"Varea, Rufino, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111264,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Biomarkers; Biomonitoring; Ecotoxicology; Oceania; Pacific Islands; Environmental risk assessment,Journal article,,,"Univ South Pacific, Fac Sci Technol & Environm, Sch Marine Studies, Laucala Bay Rd, Suva, Fiji.",Fiji,Biomarkers; Biomonitoring; Ecotoxicology; Oceania; Pacific Islands; Environmental risk assessment,FLATHEAD PLATYCEPHALUS-BASSENSIS; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; PORT PHILLIP BAY; GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; SYDNEY ROCK OYSTER; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEAVY-METALS; TAMAKI-ESTUARY; EROD ACTIVITY; SUVA HARBOR,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of the South Pacific,,Fiji,,University,Science

In this contribution, we used a method based on an optimality criterion that evaluates the spatial congruence among the distribution of different taxa and provides a value of endemicity to a given area regardless of how that it was hypothesized. This method has been widely applied to land environments, whereas in the sea it has not been well explored yet. We analyzed the geographic distribution of three crustacean groups (Amphipoda, Copepoda, and Euphausiacea) to search for areas of endemism (AEs) in the Magellan region by applying an optimality algorithm. To summarize among numerous resulting AEs, we employed a meta-consensus criterion based on a clustering analysis. We identified three main AEs and, into most of them, we recognized smaller areas for the first time: Chiloé, Atlantic coast (with a smaller area in San Jorge Gulf and Cape Blanco), and Fueguia (Channels and Fjords, Malvinas/Falklands, Burdwood Bank, and South-West Atlantic transition area). Both Atlantic coast and Fueguia do not strictly match the provinces previously defined in the literature. Our study lays the foundation for a biogeographic scheme into the Magellan region and provides new insights on zones currently placed in marine protected areas for the southern tip of South America, such as Burdwood Bank, Yaganes, and Diego Ramírez-Drake Passage. Integrating distribution patterns of many other organisms for the Magellan region will certainly help reinforce the conservation measures currently implemented.","Brun, A.A.; Griotti, M.; Roig-Juñent, S.A.; Acha, M.E.",WOS:000516343500003,"Brun, Anahí, A.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00300-020-02626-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Crustacea,,,"Southern South America, Areas of endemism, Optimality algorithm, Meta-consensus, Marine protected areas",Journal article,,,"Inst Argentino Invest Las Zonas Aridas IADIZA CON, Lab Entomol, Mendoza, Argentina.",Argentina,Southern South America; Crustacea; Areas of endemism; Optimality algorithm; Meta-consensus; Marine protected areas,SOUTHERN PATAGONIAN SHELF; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; ATLANTIC; AMERICA; BIODIVERSITY; GAMMARIDEA; PROVINCES; PARSIMONY; CRITERION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Instituto Argentino de Investigación en Zonas Áridas (IADIZA),,Argentina,,Research institute,Science

While the definition of cryptic marine fauna itself could include any major group of marine organisms, we limit the extent of our study only into the four most popular animal groups in underwater macrophotography which are: fishes, sea slugs, arthropods, and flatworms. We conducted underwater surveys using roving diver technique spanning from October 2017 to June 2019 at eleven dive sites of Sempu Strait and yielded 84 species that consists of 45 species of sea slug, 29 Species of fish, 8 species of arthropods, and 2 species of flatworms. The overall fauna diversity shows that Sempu Strait has high diversity of sea slug and cryptic fishes, while the site-specific diversity shows that Stumbut dive site has the highest marine cryptic fauna diversity.","Andrimida, A.; Hermawan, R.",,"Hermawan, Rudi, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1051/e3sconf/202015301001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the crucial problems with tracing the evolution of dorids is the relationship between cryptobranch dorids (gill cavity present) and phanerobranch dorids (gill cavity absent). Integrative morphological and molecular studies of the enigmatic Japanese dorid species of the cryptobranch genus <em>Cadlina</em>, <em>C. japonica</em> and ‘C.’<em> sagamiensis</em>, which were collected by the Emperor of Japan (Shōwa era), are presented here for the first time. It is shown that while <em>C. japonica</em> does belong to the <em>Cadlina</em> clade, another Japanese species ‘<em>C.</em>’ <em>sagamiensis</em> is not part of the cryptobranch dorids of the family Cadlinidae, but is related to both the phanerobranch dorid family, Hexabranchidae, and to the cryptobranch family <strong>Cadlinellidae stat. nov</strong>. A new genus, <strong><em>Showajidaia</em> gen. nov.</strong>, and new family, <strong>Showajidaiidae fam. nov.</strong>, are proposed for ‘<em>C.</em>’ <em>sagamiensis</em>, and four new species of the genus <em>Cadlina</em> are described based on a dorid-wide molecular phylogenetic analysis, which is the first substantial update of the dorid family system since 2010. Integration of phylogenetic data with an ontogenetic model of dorid evolution suggests that cryptobranch organization can be most reliably assessed as the ancestral state for the majority of dorids.","Korshunova, T.; Fletcher, K.; Picton, B.; Lundin, K.; Kashio, S.; Sanamyan, N.; Sanamyan, K.; Padula, V.; Schrödl, M.; Martynov, A.",WOS:000562479200004,"Kashio, Sho, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz126,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,"Morphology, ""Phylogenetics""",,"molecular systematics, taxonomic revision",Journal article,,,"Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Zool Museum, Bolshaya Nikitskaya Str 6, Moscow 125009, Russia.",Russia,molecular systematics; morphology; Mollusca; phylogenetics; taxonomic revision,FAMILY CORAMBIDAE GASTROPODA; 1ST MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; INDO-WEST PACIFIC; CHROMODORIDIDAE OPISTHOBRANCHIA; INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY; NORTH PACIFIC; GENUS; REVISION; ATLANTIC; OCEANS,Zoology,Zoology,Lomonosov Moscow State University - Museum of Zoology,x,Russia,,Museum,Science

Fish communities in this area are mainly composed of continental shelf demersal fishes, continental shelf benthopelagic fishes, and continental shelf pelagic-neritic fishes. Among them, continental shelf demersal fishes tend to occur in the daytime or during autumn, continental shelf benthopelagic fishes at night or during summer, and continental shelf pelagic-neritic fishes in the daytime or during spring. Seasonal migratory fishes are mainly observed during spring and summer. Moreover, alternate and migration indices showed the lowest stability of the community in the daytime and during winter, revealing that fishes prefer to occur around the island reef at night or in the day-night time. Such patterns are mainly affected by the seasonal shift, predominant communities, and diel alternation.

Research in Ireland on bryozoans has been sparse in recent years but many studies were carried out in the early 1900's by researchers such as Albert Russell Nichols (1859-1933). This study has a number of interlinked aims. It will evaluate the history of bryozoan research in Ireland and discuss the biologist Albert Russell Nichols (1859-1933) and his contribution to bryozoan research. Bryozoan diversity and distributional changes from Nichols' time have been examined very little, this study will examine any changes exhibited over the last 150 years. These changes will be evaluated using both a north south and east west divide by looking at historical records and the results of a recent sampling programme. A taxonomically ordered atlas using SEM images and photographs has been compiled of the bryozoans recorded from Ireland using both recent and historical records. In the last 15 years 4 non-native bryozoan species have been recorded in Ireland. Watersipora subtorquata, Tricellaria inopinata, Bugula neritina and Schizoporella japonica and other potential invasive bryozoans are discussed to evaluate their potential arrival methods and distribution around Ireland. Bugula neritina is often found as an epiphyte on algae and foliose bryozoans. The occurrence of bryozoan epiphytes and their substrate use is assessed here using specimens taken from 42 sites around Ireland.","Kelso-Maguire, A.",,"Kelso-Maguire, Antoinette, A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining the concordance between genetic and morphological variation of living populations, and then directly comparing extant and fossil morphological data, provides a robust approach for improving our identification of lineages through time. We investigate genetic and shell morphological variation in extant species of <em>Penion</em> marine snails from New Zealand, and extend this analysis into deep time using fossils. We find that genetic and morphological variation identify similar patterns and support most currently recognized extant species. However, some taxonomic over-splitting is detected due to shell size being a poor trait for species delimitation, and we identify incorrect assignment of some fossil specimens. We infer that a single evolutionary lineage (<em>Penion sulcatus</em>) has existed for 22 myr, with most aspects of shell shape and shell size evolving under a random walk. However, by removing samples previously classified as the extinct species <em>P. marwicki</em>, we instead detect morphological stasis for one axis of shell shape variation. This result demonstrates how lineage identification can change our perception of evolutionary pattern and process.

The present study investigates mantle margin diversity and ecological transitions in the Mytilidae to identify macroevolutionary patterns and test for convergent evolution. A fossil-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis of Mytilidae is inferred based on five genes for 33 species (19 genera). Morphological variation in the mantle margin is examined in 43 preserved species (25 genera) and four focal species are examined for detailed anatomy. Trait evolution is investigated by ancestral state estimation and correlation tests. Our phylogeny recovers two main clades derived from an epifaunal ancestor. Subsequently, different lineages convergently shifted to other lifestyles: semi-infaunal or boring into hard substrate. Such transitions are correlated with the development of long siphons in the posterior mantle region. Two independent origins are reconstructed for the posterior lobules on the inner fold, which are associated with intense mucociliary transport, suggesting an important cleansing role in epifaunal mussels.

Beebe’s deep-sea work began with his <em>Arcturus</em> Oceanographic Expedition in 1925 with sampling closely modelled on the <em>Michael Sars</em> deep-sea expedition. Dissatisfied with ship-based sampling of stations for a few days at best, he established a field laboratory in Bermuda to do intensive deep-water sampling. From 1929 to 1934, plankton net tows were carried out at the same site, over several months each year, totalling over 1500 net tows in deep waters. Here, the sampling efforts and results are reviewed from both the <em>Arcturus</em> Expedition and the Bermuda station. Study of the deep-sea samples yielded 43 scientific articles, published from 1926 to 1952, on a large variety of taxa. Beebe is still a popular figure connected in the public view with deep-sea exploration from his famous Bathysphere dives at the Bermuda site. However, his name rarely, if ever, appears in academic reviews of deep-sea biology or deep-sea expeditions.

However, investigations focusing on the characterization of meiofaunal organisms inhabiting shallow vent sediments are still scant compared to that on macrofauna. In the present study, we investigated the meiobenthic assemblages and nematode diversity inhabiting the Secca delle Fumose (SdF), a shallow water vent area located in the Gulf of Naples (Italy). In this area, characterized by a rapid change in the environmental conditions on a relative small spatial scale (i.e., 100 m), we selected four sampling sites: one diffusive emission site (H); one geyser site (G) and two inactive sites (CN, CS). Total meiofauna abundance did not vary significantly between active and inactive sites and between surface and deeper sediment layers due to a high inter-replicate variability, suggesting a pronounced spatial-scale patchiness in distribution of meiofauna. Nematofauna at site H presented the typical features of deep-sea vents with low structural and functional diversity, high biomass and dominance of few genera (i.e., <i>Oncholaimus</i>; <i>Daptonema</i>) while from site G we reported diversity values comparable to that of the inactive sites. We hypothesized that site G presented a condition of “intermediate disturbance” that could maintain a high nematode diversity. Environmental features such as sediment temperature, pH, total organic carbon and interstitial waters ions were found to be key factors influencing patterns of meiofauna and nematofauna assemblages at SdF. Even though the general theory is that nematodes inhabiting shallow vent areas include a subset of species that live in background sediments, this was not the case for SdF vent area. Due to a marked change in nematode composition between all sites and to the presence of many exclusive species, every single investigated site was characterized by a distinct nematofauna reflecting the high spatial heterogeneity of SdF.","Baldrighi, E.; Zeppilli, D.; Appolloni, L.; Donnarumma, L.; Chianese, E.; Russo, G.F.; Sandulli, R.",WOS:000536400500003,"Appolloni, Luca, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.9058,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Inst Francais Rech Exploitat MER IFREMER, Lab Environm Profond, Plouzane, France.",France,Secca delle Fumose; Gulf of Naples; Shallow vent; Meiofauna; Nematode diversity,WATER HYDROTHERMAL VENT; LIVING MARINE NEMATODES; DEEP-SEA; BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; SPECIES NEMATODA; AEOLIAN ARC; PACIFIC; MEIOBENTHOS; ISLAND,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER),,,,,

The resulting deposit provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of mine tailings on coastal marine ecosystems after ca 30 years since the discharge has ceased. We investigated meiofaunal abundance, biomass and biodiversity along a gradient of metal concentration that overlaps with a bathymetric gradient from 30 to 60 m depth. Despite the localized presence of extremely high concentration of metals, the bay was not a biological desert, but, nevertheless, was characterized by evident signs of impact on benthic diversity. Meiofaunal variables increased significantly with decreasing metal contamination, eventually reaching values comparable to other uncontaminated coastal sediments. Our results show that mine tailings influenced the spatial distribution of meiofaunal taxa and nematode species composition. In particular, we report here that the bay was characterized by the dominance of nematode opportunistic species tolerant to high metal concentration. The effects of mine tailing discharge on meiofaunal biodiversity and composition were still evident ca 30 years after the end of the mining activities.

Here, we report previously undocumented levels of epibiont abundance and biodiversity for loggerhead sea turtles (<span class=""html-italic"">Caretta caretta</span>), by focusing on the microscopic meiofauna. During the peak of the 2018 loggerhead nesting season at St. George Island, Florida, USA, we sampled all epibionts from 24 carapaces. From the subsamples, we identified 38,874 meiofauna individuals belonging to 20 higher taxa. This means 810,753 individuals were recovered in our survey, with an average of 33,781 individuals per carapace. Of 6992 identified nematodes, 111 different genera were observed. To our knowledge, such levels of sea turtle epibiont abundance and diversity have never been recorded. Loggerhead carapaces are without doubt hotspots of meiofaunal and nematode diversity, especially compared to other non-sedimentary substrates. The posterior carapace sections harbored higher diversity and evenness compared to the anterior and middle sections, suggesting increased colonization and potentially facilitation favoring posterior carapace epibiosis, or increased disturbance on the anterior and middle carapace sections. Our findings also shed new light on the meiofauna paradox: “How do small, benthic meiofauna organisms become cosmopolitan over large geographic ranges?” Considering high loggerhead epibiont colonization, the large distances loggerheads migrate for reproduction and feeding, and the evolutionary age and sheer numbers of sea turtles worldwide, potentially large-scale exchange and dispersal for meiofauna through phoresis is implied. We distinguished different groups of loggerhead carapaces based on divergent epibiont communities, suggesting distinct epibiont colonization processes.

We have recorded the presence of five major genetic lineages in the Altiplano, of which one seems to be exclusive to Lake Titicaca and nearby areas, whereas the rest occur also in other regions of South America. Eleven out of 36 South American entities diagnosed by molecular delimitation criteria in our study are likely endemic to the Titicaca and neighbouring water bodies. We have detected a remarkable disagreement between morphology and genetic data in the Titicacan <em>Hyalella</em>, with occurrence of several cases of the same morpho-species corresponding to several Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), some even distantly related, and other instances where a particular MOTU is shared by a morphologically heterogeneous array of species, including species with body smooth and others with body heavily armoured. Species diversification and incongruence between morphological and molecular boundaries within this species assemblage may be associated to the sharp changes in hydrological conditions experienced by the water bodies of the Altiplano in the past, which included dramatic fluctuations in water level and salinity of Lake Titicaca. Such environmental shifts could have triggered rapid morphological changes and ecological differentiation within the <em>Hyalella</em> assemblage, followed by phenotypic convergence among the diverse lineages.

In this study, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of water quality and algae community in Nanjing city were investigated with microscopic examination for one year. Results showed that the water pollution in this area was mainly related to high concentration of nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N and TN (Total nitrogen). There was a total of 77 species of algae in the studied rivers from June 2016 to May 2017, among which 73 species of planktic algae and 34 species of epipelic algae, in which the abundance and biomass of the latter were 1925 and 904 times that of the former, respectively. The two kinds of algae had different change tendencies which were related to seasons. For planktic algae, the abundance and biomass decreased in this season sequence: summer, spring, autumn, and winter. For epipelic algae, the abundance and biomass were relatively higher in winter. The dominant community of planktic algae was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type, while that of epipelic algae was Bacillariophyceae—Cyanobacteria type. Most of the present algae were bi-trophic species, and were tightly related to the pollution characteristics of the rivers. The key environmental factors for planktic algae are T, TN, and TP, and those for Epipelic algae are N:P and TN. The relation between the community composition of planktic and epipelic algae and environmental parameters are highly complex, and it is worth carrying out further study to clarify their interaction mechanism.","Xia, L.; Zhu, Y.; Zhao, Z.",WOS:000555915200090,"Xia, Liling, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/w12051311,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,epipelon; heavily polluted rivers; planktic algae; water quality,Journal article,,,"Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,epipelon; heavily polluted rivers; planktic algae; water quality,PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; PHYSICOCHEMICAL FACTORS; SPECIES COMPOSITION; QINHUAI RIVER; WATER-QUALITY; LAKE; DYNAMICS; CYANOBACTERIA,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,Hohai University,,China,,University,Science

It can be differentiated from the known European <em>Pisidium</em> species on the basis of shell morphology and DNA sequence data for the mitochondrial cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA genes. Despite critical evaluation of a large number of potential names from the current synonymies of morphologically similar <em>Pisidium</em> species, no available name was found. <em>Pisidium interstitialis</em> n. sp. is most similar to <em>P. personatum</em> Malm, 1856, and <em>P. casertanum</em> (Poli, 1791), both of which occur syntopically with the new species. Typical specimens of the new species can be readily identified on the basis of shell morphology. However, <em>P. personatum</em> and <em>P. casertanum</em> are morphologically highly variable, so that occasional overlap in conchological characters between these two species and <em>P. interstitialis</em> n. sp. does occur. Although these three taxa co-occur, microhabitat analyses using a special sampling technique showed that <em>P. interstitialis</em> n. sp. exhibits an exclusively interstitial lifestyle, living outside open water bodies. While other <em>Pisidium</em> species may live in the interstitial water of semi-terrestrial habitats, this is the first time that an exclusively interstitial lifestyle has been observed for <em>Pisidium</em> and this may explain why <em>P. interstitialis</em> n. sp. has remained undiscovered for so long. To date, despite the examination of large quantities of Central European samples of <em>Pisidium</em>, the new species is only known from the two areas reported in our study.

Although the behavior of a few species of sea pens has been sporadically reported since the seventeenth century, and despite their presence across a wide range of habitats, the behavior of most sea pen taxa has not been well studied or documented. In this study, via video images of an <i>Echinoptilum</i> sp. specimen in an aquarium (shown in this study at 128-times speed), we observed unreported aspects of behavior, namely mole-like movement within the seafloor sand, and bending of the colony when emerging from the sand. Such mole-like behavior may be advantageous to avoid dangerous and other unfavorable situations, such as predation and competition for space. Aspects of <i>Echinoptilum</i> sp.’s morphology, such as a digitiform colony shape, lack of an axis, and the presence of retractable autozooids and three-flanged sclerites may assist in this behavior. Finally, it appears that peristalsis and active movements are common features for anthozoans in sandy bottom environments, and have so far been reported from sea pens, zoantharians, and scleractinian corals.","Kushida, Y.; Higashiji, T.; Reimer, J.D.",WOS:000525261100002,"Higashiji, Takuo, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-020-01054-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Mol Invertebrate Systemat & Ecol Lab, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.",Japan,Octocoral; Pennatulacea; Echinoptilum; Behavior report; Cnidaria,WITHDRAWAL BEHAVIOR; PENNATULACEA; CNIDARIA; COELENTERATA; OCTOCORALLIA; CORALS,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of the Ryukyus,,Japan,,University,Science

As other marine organisms, these gastropods are still quite unexplored, but they provide a stunning arsenal of compounds with interesting activities. Among their natural products, terpenoids are particularly abundant and diverse, including monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, sesterterpenoids, triterpenoids, tetraterpenoids, and steroids. This review evaluates the different kinds of terpenoids found in heterobranchs and reports on their bioactivity. It includes more than 330 metabolites isolated from ca. 70 species of heterobranchs. The monoterpenoids reported may be linear or monocyclic, while sesquiterpenoids may include linear, monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic molecules. Diterpenoids in heterobranchs may include linear, monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic, or tetracyclic compounds. Sesterterpenoids, instead, are linear, bicyclic, or tetracyclic. Triterpenoids, tetraterpenoids, and steroids are not as abundant as the previously mentioned types. Within heterobranch molluscs, no terpenoids have been described in this period in tylodinoideans, cephalaspideans, or pteropods, and most terpenoids have been found in nudibranchs, anaspideans, and sacoglossans, with very few compounds in pleurobranchoideans and pulmonates. Monoterpenoids are present mostly in anaspidea, and less abundant in sacoglossa. Nudibranchs are especially rich in sesquiterpenes, which are also present in anaspidea, and in less numbers in sacoglossa and pulmonata. Diterpenoids are also very abundant in nudibranchs, present also in anaspidea, and scarce in pleurobranchoidea, sacoglossa, and pulmonata. Sesterterpenoids are only found in nudibranchia, while triterpenoids, carotenoids, and steroids are only reported for nudibranchia, pleurobranchoidea, and anaspidea. Many of these compounds are obtained from their diet, while others are biotransformed, or <span class=""html-italic"">de novo</span> biosynthesized by the molluscs.

Herein, we assess the effects of this activity on the functional structure of the macroinvertebrate community and its recovery processes based on a 4-year survey, in the South Dongting Lake in China. Our result showed a simplified macroinvertebrate functional structures within the dredged area, as evidenced by a loss of certain trait categories (e.g., oval and conical body form) and a significant reduction in trait values due to the direct removal of macroinvertebrates and indirect alternations to physical environmental conditions (e.g., water depth and %Medium sand). Moreover, clear increases were observed in certain trait categories (e.g., small body size and swimmer) resulting from the dredging-related disturbance (e.g., increased turbidity) within the adjacent area. Furthermore, one year after the cessation of dredging, a marked recovery in the taxonomic and functional structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages was observed with most lost trait categories returning and an increase in the trait values of eight categories (e.g., body size 1.00–3.00 cm and oval body form) within the dredged and adjacent area. In addition, dispersal processes and sediment composition were the main driver for the structuring of the macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional assemblages during the dredging stages, whilst water environmental conditions dominated the taxonomic structure and dispersal processes determined the functional structure during the recovery stage.

The hectocotylus morphology varies to a great extent across genera and species. In particular, one to several pedicels in its proximal third lose their sucker and become highly and diversely modified in shape to constitute a copulatory apparatus. An evolutionary gradient was observed in the copulatory apparatus morphology, from the simple modification into a papilla of just one pedicel from the third element of the ventral sucker row (some nominal species of <em>Euprymna</em>) to a quite complex structure involving several variously modified pedicels from both the ventral and dorsal sucker rows (<em>Inioteuthis</em>). In some species, elements in the distal portion of the hectocotylus may also be highly modified, such as the columnar suckers in <em>Euprymna</em>. The hectocotylian diversity allows to distinguish nine groups of species that do not match the current generic subdivision of Sepiolinae. Additional morphological characters (number of sucker rows on arms, female bursa copulatrix, occurrence and shape of visceral light organs, etc.) corroborate the subdivision of Sepiolinae into nine subtaxa, i.e., genera. Accordingly, a cladogram is drawn to describe the possible phylogenetic relationships among the nine clades.

These activities predominantly take place in Limfjorden, a large microtidal sound, and in the Inner Danish waters. Both areas are shallow, estuarine, receive high nutrient inputs from agriculture, and are of nature conservation interest (Natura 2000 sites), thus presenting challenges for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Using high-resolution fisheries data (~10 m), we investigated the effects of bivalve dredging on benthic communities at both local (Natura 2000 site) and regional (fishery-wide) scales. Regionally, our results showed that dredging intensity correlated with shifts in species composition and reduced community biomass. We were, however, unable to detect an effect of dredging on community density, trait richness, and trait composition. These metrics were significantly related to other environmental drivers, such as sediment organic content (negative) and mussel bed biomass (positive). At the local scale, the observed relationships between dredging, biomass, and species composition varied significantly. This occurred as dredging impacts were greater in areas that contained suitable reference conditions and experienced relatively low levels of eutrophication and natural disturbance. By contrast, communities which experienced high nutrient loading, regular anoxic events, and high natural variability were relatively unaffected by dredging. Our results therefore highlight the importance of spatial scales in fishing impact estimations.

Potential kleptoparasitism-scavenging interactions between crabs and shell-boring gastropods feeding on bivalve prey: a global survey. <i>Plankton Benthos Res. 15(2)</i>: 132-145. <a href=""https://hdl.handle.net/10.3800/pbr.15.132"" target=""_blank"">https://hdl.handle.net/10.3800/pbr.15.132</a>","Shell-boring gastropod molluscs and crabs are important predators of many bivalve molluscs, and impact bivalve populations and food webs. When gastropods and crabs target the same bivalve prey, complex interactions between them arise that mediate their impacts. Kleptoparasitism and scavenging (K-S) interactions result when one predator, usually the gastropod, loses or abandons its prey, which is then stolen or scavenged by the other. Such interactions have thus far only been reported among nine crab-gastropod species groups when they fed on shared bivalve prey, but potentially occur among many others. This study used the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) database to search for records of shell-boring gastropods and crabs preying on the same bivalve to identify tritrophic bivalve-crab-gastropod systems in which K-S interactions may occur. In total, 871 such systems were found, which included 58 bivalve species that were each eaten by 1–8 species of shell-boring gastropods and 1–19 species of crabs. In the vast majority of these systems (>99%), no previous report of K-S interactions has been published, although in 334 cases the gastropod and crab have been reported to undergo competitive or predator-prey interactions, which may indicate that K-S and other complex interactions occur among them. The tritrophic systems identified in the present survey should be investigated in future studies to determine whether the identified crab and gastropod taxa do in fact undergo K-S interactions. Doing so will enable the development of a theoretical framework for assessing the occurrence, evolution, utilization, and impacts of these interactions in natural systems.","Quinn, B.K.",WOS:000600496700006,"Quinn, Brady, B.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3800/pbr.15.132,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,"Bivalve, crab, shell-boring gastropod, kleptoparasitism, scavenging",Journal article,,,"Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol Sci, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada.",Canada,Bivalve; crab; shell-boring gastropod; kleptoparasitism; scavenging,MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; NUCELLA-LAPILLUS; CARCINUS-MAENAS; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; MULTIPLE PREDATORS; BLUE MUSSELS; SHORE; DIET; COMPETITION; BEHAVIOR,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of New Brunswick - Department of Biology,x,Canada,,University,Science

The new genus of the subfamily Eurycopinae Hansen, 1916, which is distinguished genetically, differs morphologically from the other six genera of this subfamily by the unique combination of the following characters: a rostrum approximately one third of the cephalon width and as long as antenna I article 1, with rounded margins, and the fingerprint pattern surface; pereonites 5 and 6 are fused dorsomedially, pereonite 7 is free; antenna I article 1 is without distomedial lobe and with small a distolateral projection; epipod of the maxilliped is less than two thirds of basis length and ovoid. Unique for the subfamily is the long pereopod II ischium, which is longer than the basis. Such characteristics can only be found in some munnopsid genera of the subfamily Munnopsinae Lilljeborg, 1864. Confirmed as distinct species by genetic analysis, the two new species can be morphologically distinguished from each other via a difference in width of the cephalon rostrum, the length of the palp and epipod of the maxilliped, length and width of distomedial lobes of pleopod 1, the width of carpi of the pereopods I, V and VI, and the different ratio of the uropod rami length.

Two economically important salmonid-infecting myxosporeans from rivers of the northwestern United States, <em>Ceratonova shasta</em> (Noble, 1950) and <em>Parvicapsula minibicornis </em>Kent <em>et al.</em>, 1997, have life cycles that require a freshwater annelid host, identified previously as <em>Manayunkia speciosa</em> Leidy, 1859. This species was described originally from Pennsylvania, with subsequent records from New Jersey, the Great Lakes and west coast river basins. Despite apparent widespread distributions of both suitable fish hosts and the nominal annelid host, both parasites are restricted to river basins in the northwestern US and have never been recorded from the Great Lakes or the eastern US. In this study, we sampled 94 infected and uninfected annelids from two northwestern US rivers to confirm the identity of the host. We found these new specimens had mitochondrial COI sequences with no more than 4.5% distance from each other, but with at least 11% divergence from <em>M. speciosa</em> sampled from near the type locality (New Jersey) and Lake Superior. We did not recover any <em>M. speciosa</em> from either west coast river. The annelid from the Klamath and Willamette rivers showed marked sexual dimorphism that has not been reported in any <em>Manayunkia</em> described to date, though it is apparent that this had been missed in <em>M. speciosa</em>. Accordingly, we describe a new taxon, <em>Manayunkia occidentalis</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong>, and show that it can host both <em>C. shasta</em> and <em>P. minibicornis</em>. We suspect that previous records of <em>Manayunkia</em> from Pacific Northwest watersheds are likely to be <em>M. occidentalis</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong> and not <em>M. speciosa</em>.

The accuracy of species-level assignment, and consequent taxonomic coverage, relies on comprehensive DNA barcode reference libraries, which, due to incompleteness, are currently a recognized limitation for metabarcoding applications. In this study, we assembled a comprehensive reference library of DNA barcodes for Atlantic Iberia marine macroinvertebrate species, assessed gaps in species coverage and examined data ambiguities. Initially, an Iberian species checklist for the three dominant groups of marine macroinvertebrates was compiled, comprising 2827 species (926 Annelida, 638 Crustacea and 1263 Mollusca). A total of 18162 DNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I barcode region (COI-5P) matching the species checklist were compiled in a BOLD dataset, where taxonomic discordances were evaluated and cases of deep intraspecific divergence flagged. Gap-analysis showed that 63% of the Iberian macroinvertebrate species still lack a DNA barcode. Coverage gaps varied considerably across taxonomic groups with Mollusca displaying the highest sequence representation in the dataset (427 species, 49% of the total number of sequences), and Crustacea the highest species coverage with 338 species barcoded (53% of the checklist). In contrast, Polychaeta displayed the lower levels of completion (288 species, 16% of the total number of sequences). In total, 1545 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) were assigned to 1053 barcoded species, of which 66% were taxonomically concordant, 26% displayed multiple BINs and 8% were discordant. Overall, results show that there is still a large portion of marine invertebrate taxa in this region of Europe pending barcode coverage, even considering only the dominant groups. However, the most notable finding was the relevant proportion of species flagged for significant intraspecific divergence and possible hidden diversity. The annotated reference library and gap-analysis here provided can therefore contribute to prioritize marine macroinvertebrate taxa for future research efforts and barcode coverage.","Leite, B.R.; Vieira, P.E.; Teixeira, M.A.L.; Lobo-Arteaga, J.; Hollatz, C.; Borges, L.M.S.; Duarte, S.; Troncoso, J.S.; Costa, F.O.",WOS:000562971100007,"Leite, B.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101307,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Macroinvertebrates; DNA barcoding; Reference library; Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; Atlantic iberia,Journal article,,,"Univ Minho, Ctr Mol & Environm Biol CBMA, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",Portugal,Macroinvertebrates; DNA barcoding; Reference library; Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; Atlantic iberia,BARCODE REFERENCE LIBRARY; DNA; NORTHERN; GASTROPODA; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; COASTAL; HETEROBRANCHIA; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMATICS,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Minho,,Portugal,,University,Science

This large modioliform mussel thrives around diffusive vents in aggregation with another dominant hydrothermal vent mussel, <em>Bathymodiolus marisindicus</em>. <em>G. vrijenhoeki</em> n. sp. was distinguished from its neighboring <em>B. marisindicus</em> by its distinct shell profile, which consists of an elongated shell with a short and low anterior region, high expanded posterior region, and deep ventral concavity.

The present study aimed to decipher this research axis after selecting and culturing a single nematode species from an entire community through original laboratory protocols. The purpose of this investigation was to change the grain size of the sediment into the immediate environment of nematodes by progressively adding a biosubstrate made from <em>Sepia officinalis</em> endoskeletton. At the end of the experiment, <em>Metoncholaimus pristiurus</em> became the unique component of the nematode species when the sediment was enriched with 80% of <em>S.&nbsp;officinalis</em> powder. After the mono-species level had been achieved, the selected species was fed on an another biosubstrate made from bodies of <em>Porcellio scaber</em> under the identical laboratory controlled conditions of light and temperature adopted during the selection process. Accordingly, the bioassay protocol this study layed new foundations for the study of meiobenthic nematodes in the biomarker field. Our results revealed that, in case of <em>M.&nbsp;pritiurus</em>, discernible oxidative stress responses are valid for catalase and gluthatione <em>S</em>-transferase. Indeed, for both enzymes, a clear increase in the activity was recorded, and the response was more reinforced when zinc and permethrin were administrated in combination. The relevance of the protocols proposed in this work parallels their global applicability to reach and maintain the monospecific level in laboratory by using biosubstrates made from animals widely distributed. It is true also that our data provided the first results in terms of biochemical biomarkers for meiobenthic nematodes and showed that the selected taxa, <em>M.&nbsp;pristiurus</em>, could be one of the first marine taxa responding early to the tested stressors, zinc and permethrin, even at very low concentrations.","Allouche, M.; Nasri, A.; Harrath, A.H.; Mansour, L.; Alwasel, S.; Beyrem, H.; Bourioug, M.; Geret, F.; Boufahja, F.",WOS:000539427600088,"Harrath, Abdel, A.H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114529,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Metoncholaimus pristiurus,,,Species selection; Biosubstrate ; Meiobenthic nematodes; Metoncholaimus pristiurus; Biomarkers; Oxidative stress,Journal article,,,"Univ Carthage, Fac Sci Bizerte, Coastal Ecol & Ecotoxicol Unit, Lab Environm Biomonitoring, Zarzouna 7021, Tunisia.",Tunisia,Species selection; Biosubstrate; Meiobenthic nematodes; Metoncholaimus pristiurus; Biomarkers; Oxidative stress,GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY STATUS; FREE-LIVING NEMATODES; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; STAGE JUVENILES; PERMETHRIN; COMMUNITY; PYRETHROIDS; MIGRATION; COASTS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Carthage,,Tunisia,,University,Science

Here, we used species distribution models to project habitat suitability for eight invasive ascidians under present-day and future climate scenarios. Distance to shore and maximum sea surface temperature were identified as the most important variables affecting species distributions. Results showed that eight ascidians might respond differently to future climate change. Alarmingly, currently colonized areas are much smaller than predicted, suggesting ascidians may expand their invasive ranges.

The species’ high capacity to tolerate low levels of dissolved oxygen, variations in salinity, as well as extremely low and high temperatures all aid in the success of the species. In the Colombian Caribbean, no formal records of Ctenophora or reference material to support the presence of <em>M. leidyi</em> exist. The objectives of this work were to taxonomically identify the ctenophoran species that inhabits Mallorquín Lagoon (located in the central area of the Colombian Caribbean coast) and to establish relationships between species presence and physical–chemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity). Specimens were collected during six sampling events from September 2018 to January 2019 from six stations in the coastal lagoon (n=35 total sampling events). <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em> was identified based on morphological characteristics. <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em> individuals were collected at five of six stations. As well, <em>M. leidyi</em> was not observed in some sampling events, possibly due to an increase in the freshwater flow to the coastal lagoon by the León Creek tributary. <em>M. leidyi</em> was found mainly in hypoxic locations, with values between 1.68 - 5.05 mg/L. This work is the first confirmed record of <em>M. leidyi</em> in the Colombian Caribbean and provides ecological knowledge of the species in brackish coastal Mallorquín Lagoon. These results are an important basis for the continued monitoring of the species relative to the changing conditions of Mallorquín Lagoon.","Durán-Fuentes, J.; Gracia C., A.",WOS:000525758600066,"Durán-Fuentes, Jeferson, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101248,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Dissolved oxygen,,Coastal lagoon; Native species; Gelatinous organism,Journal article,,,"Univ Atlantico, Km 7 Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia.",Colombia,Coastal lagoon; Dissolved oxygen; Native species; Gelatinous organisms,BLACK-SEA; PREDATION; DYNAMICS; INVADER; BIOMASS; BAY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Auckland,,New Zealand,,University,Science

Because they lack a planktonic larval stage, it has been hypothesized that marine benthic amphipod crustaceans may have short dispersal distances, high endemicity, and spatial turnover in species composition, and consequently high global species richness. In this study, we examined over 400000 distribution records of 4876 amphipod species, and identified 12 regions of endemicity. The number and percent of endemic species peaked at 30°-35°S and coincided with 3 of these regions of high endemicity: Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Pelagic species of marine amphipod crustaceans were more cosmopolitan than benthic species. The latitudinal patterns of richness (alpha, gamma, and ES50) and species turnover were at least bimodal. Most occurrence records and greater alpha and gamma richness were in mid-latitudes, reflecting sampling bias. Both ES50 and beta diversity had similar richness in the tropics, mid-latitudes, and on the Antarctic shelf around 70°S. These 2 indices exhibited a sharp dip in the deep Southern Ocean at 55°S. ES50 peaked at 30°-35°S and a small dip was apparent near the equator at 5°-10°N. Beta diversity was driven mostly by turnover rather than nestedness. These findings support the need for conservation in each realm of species endemicity—and for amphipods, particularly in Antarctica and the coastal mid-latitudes (30°-35°S) of the Southern Hemisphere.","Arfianti, T.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000521740400007,"Costello, Mark John, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps13272,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Conservation, ""Endemicity""",,"Latitudinal gradients, Species richness, Species turnover ",Journal article,,,"Indonesian Inst Sci, Jakarta 12710, Indonesia.",Indonesia,Endemicity; Latitudinal gradients; Conservation; Species richness; Species turnover,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; GRADIENTS; RICHNESS; DISPERSAL; TURNOVER; ECOLOGY; PATTERN; SCALE,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI),,Indonesia,,Research institute,Science

Globally, many of these habitats are extensively fragmented but our understanding of key ecological processes is drawn from older studies performed in less degraded environments with extensive reef habitats. We tested whether proximity to habitat edges affected the persistence and functioning of fragmented intertidal mussel reefs, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, at three sites in sedimentary habitats in Northern Ireland. Specifically, we quantified and compared key ecological properties in mid-habitat and edges and hypothesised that at the edges, there would be (i) larger individual mussels, (ii) lower recruitment, (iii) lower associated taxon diversity, (iv) lower biodeposition, (v) greater predation intensity and (vi) greater food availability. Additionally, we tested whether rates of functioning (e.g. organic matter accumulation) were greater in mussel patches (edge and mid-habitat) compared to sediment without mussels (vii). We did find larger mussels at the edges of patches, where there was also less organic enrichment of the sediment compared to mid-habitat (but more than areas without mussels). None of the other variables quanitifed differed consistently between the edge and mid-habitat. The lack of strong edge effects identified may be explained by the nature of the mussel habitat in this study, i.e. intrinsically greater proportion of edges compared to more extensive reefs. Our results suggest that at the scale of the reef patches in this study, edge effects were not as strong as previously thought in terms of regulating key ecological processes.","Bertolini, C.; Montgomery, W.

Onehundred- thirty-eight marine species in 15 classes or functional groups are NIS in Brazil. Brazilian states with greater maritime commerce (greater market share) had more marine NIS. From the period between the 1950s to 2010, the number of NIS at least doubled each decade.

This taxon has also been recently redescribed by designation of a clade A specimen as the neotype. To clarify the taxonomic status of clade E and its relationship to clade A, we examine the entire mitochondrial genome and study the morphology of clade E. The mitogenome of clade E has an identical gene order to clade A, but substantially differs in the size of several non-coding regions. Remarkably, the nucleotide divergence of clade A-clade E is incompatible with the intraspecies ascidian divergence, but similar to the congeneric one and almost identical to the divergence between species once considered morphologically indistinguishable (e.g. the pair <em>Ciona intestinalis</em> (Linnaeus, 1767)-<em>Ciona robusta</em> Hoshino & Tokioka, 1967, and the pair <em>Botrylloides niger</em> Herdman, 1886-<em>Botrylloides leachii</em> (Savigny, 1816)). Clade E differs morphologically from the <em>Botryllus</em><em>schlosseri</em> neotype mainly in the number and appearance of the stomach folds, and the shape of the anal opening, the first intestinal loop and the typhlosole. Our integrative taxonomical approach clearly distinguishes clade E as a species separate from <em>Botryllus</em><em>schlosseri</em>, with unique morphological and molecular characters.

However, new knowledge means that what we understand each species to be may change over time. Online species databases are improving accessibility to this knowledge and expertise and provide an easy way to keep up to date with species nomenclature and classification. I propose three practical priorities for taxonomy: (1) complete a world list of all known species; (2) establish an online cooperative community infrastructure that updates species nomenclature and links it to associated literature, information and expertise; (3) create an internet portal as a key to life on Earth. The first is near completion in the Catalogue of Life. The second has an exemplar in the World Register of Marine Species. The third goal has not begun but some of its ingredients exist. This key to life should make it easy for anybody with internet access to accurately name, and discover unnamed, species, and learn about their natural history.

Data on the taxonomic composition and biomass of phytoplankton, the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl), particulate organic carbon, primary production, chemical and physical properties of the environment were obtained using field observations, satellite scanners and two Bio-Argo floats. Different species predominated in cold-water and warm-water areas. In the vast cold-water area formed in the central part of the sea due to strong wind exposure for a month, two diatoms prevailed in the phytoplankton biomass: <em>Pseudosollenia calcar-avis</em> and <em>Hemiaulus hauckii</em>. Three-month observations using satellites and Bio-Argo floats showed that in the upper mixed layer (UML) an increase in Chl during the autumn occurred in a pulse mode in response to severe storms which caused the deepening of the UML. In the warm-water area with depleted inorganic nitrogen, located in the north-eastern part of the sea, coccolithophore <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> prevailed. Periods with high precipitation were often followed by an increase in the abundance of coccolithophores, which indicates an important role of terrestrial runoff as a source of nutrients. Two different mechanisms increased the phytoplankton biomass and Chl in young (two-week-old) mesoscale cyclonic eddies located within the cold-water area. The rise of the nutricline and wind-induced mixing resulted in pulsed nutrient inputs into the upper layers which stimulated the growth of diatoms and dinoflagellates. At the same time, the uplift of nutricline to a depth of 25–30&nbsp;m with the daily integrated irradiance of 0.2–1.0&nbsp;mol photons m<sup>−2</sup>&nbsp;day<sup>−1</sup> was sufficient to form a strong deep Chl maximum consisting of small flagellates and unicellular cyanobacteria.","Mikaelyan, A.S.; Mosharov, S.A.; Kubryakov, A.A.; Pautova, L.A.; Fedorov, A.V.; Chasovnikov, V.K.",WOS:000537320900008,"Kubryakov, Arseniy, A.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2020.103368,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Diatoms,,Mesoscale eddy; phytoplankton bloom; Coccolithophores; Phytoplankton vertical structure; Black Sea,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nakhimovski Prosp, Moscow 117997, Russia.",Russia,"Mesoscale eddy, phytoplankton bloom; Diatoms; Coccolithophores; Phytoplankton vertical structure; Black Sea",UPPER LAYER CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; MESOSCALE EDDIES; COASTAL WATERS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MIXED-LAYER; ALBORAN SEA; CHLOROPHYLL; DIATOMS,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography",Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - P.P.

University of California: Santa Barbara. viii, 90 pp.","Parasites often track food web linkages through their complex life cycles, but most food webs do not systematically include parasites. Where studied, parasites have strong effects on food web structure. Kelp forests are famous for strong trophic interactions, and their dynamic and open nature make them very different relative to the systems where parasites have been thoroughly studied (salt marsh, sand flat, and lake ecosystems). The objective of this dissertation was to build a high-resolution topological kelp-forest food web that includes parasites. I used this food web to address the research question: How do parasites affect food-web structure? Chapter 1 provides background and motivation for this work by reviewing key areas of research in kelp forest ecology and the effects of parasites in food webs. Chapter 2 describes the study system and a free-living food web with 490 species across 23 Phyla, with 546 distinct life stages and 8,759 trophic interactions. Chapter 3 describes the parasites in the food web, which adds 422 species across 10 Phyla (521 life stages) and 2,745 trophic interactions between parasites and hosts to the network for a total of 11,504 links. Adding trophic interactions between predator and parasites (concomitant predation) adds a further 9,536 links to the network. Chapter 4 examines the effects parasite addition on food-web structure. The kelp-forest food web was greatly enriched through resolution of free-living species and parasites, and parasites made up a larger proportion of the kelp-forest food web than any other published food web with parasites. Some of the effects of parasite addition were related to increasing network size and contrasted patterns in other systems (e.g. decreased connectance). On the other hand, other effects (e.g. longest chain length) were consistent with predictions based on other systems and were not due to increased network size alone. Specialist parasites and concomitant links altered the degree distribution independent of network size. Parasite life cycles are embedded throughout diverse patterns of free-living species interactions and must navigate a dense network of predators to infect appropriate hosts. The kelp forest ecosystem provides a diverse source of food and a diverse set of predators for both free-living and parasitic species, and our understanding of kelp forest ecosystems is enriched by including them.","Morton, D.N.",,"Morton, Dana Nicole, D.N.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 1885 specimens were collected and classified into 5 families and 42 species.

The highest values of species richness and diversity were recorded at station TS13 (1097-1099 m): S=25 species; H’(log<sub>2</sub>)=4.05. The near-bottom vertical distribution of the cumacean fauna showed the same pattern at all stations: at least 60% of the individu­als were sampled by the lower net of the sledge and a drastic abundance decrease occurred between the two lowermost water layers sampled by the sledge. The multivariate analysis carried out on abundance data discriminated three main groups of stations distributed across depth (TS09 excluded): group Ia (346-485 m) characterized by the dominance of Nannastacidae (57.2%) at family level and <em>Campylaspis sulcata, Leptostylis macrura</em> at species level; group Ib (522-714 m) characterized by the dominance of Nannastacidae (66.1%) at family level and <em>Campylaspis squamifera, C. laevigata</em> and <em>Leptostylis ma­crura</em> at species level; and group II (790-1099 m) characterized by the dominance of Diastylidae (40.3%) at family level and <em>Makrokylindrus (Adiastylis) josephinae, Leucon (Epileucon) pusillus</em> and <em>Diastyloides serratus</em> at species level. According to this analysis, the main faunal change occurs between group I and II between 714 and 790 m, in relation to changes in the texture of surficial sediments.

The late Tithonian to early Berriasian <em>Buchia terebratuloides</em> is considered to be the best approximate indicator of the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition in the Rollrock Section. The middle early Berriasian <em>Praetollia maynci</em> and the late early Berriasian <em>Borealites fedorovi</em> tie the respective horizons to the successive <em>Chetaites sibiricus</em> and <em>Hectoroceras kochi</em> zones. Two species of the belemnite <em>Arctoteuthis</em>, collected from an interval with common glendonites, suggest a Valanginian age for the upper Deer Bay Formation. The dearth of Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous macrofossils in the Sverdrup Basin is inferred to be predominantly a function of diagenetic carbonate loss. Abundant dropstones and glendonites in the middle Tithonian to middle Valanginian interval suggest cold climatic conditions, and make the Rollrock Section a prime candidate for studying the Arctic environmental perturbations of this time.","Schneider, S.; Kelly, S.R.A.; Mutterlose, J.; Herrle, J.O.; Hülse, P.; Jolley, D.W.; Schröder-Adams, C.J.; Lopez-Mir, B.",WOS:000558723900016,"Kelly, Simon, S.R.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cretres.2020.104508,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Buchia,,,"Tithonian, Berriasian, Valanginian, palaeoclimate, Dorsoplanitidae, Craspeditinae, belemnites",Journal article,,,"CASP, West Bldg,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0UD, England.",England,Tithonian; Berriasian; Valanginian; Palaeoclimate; Buchia; Dorsoplanitidae; Craspeditinae; Belemnites,SVERDRUP BASIN; STRATIGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; CLIMATE; SEEP,Geology; Paleontology,Geology; Paleontology,,,,,,

There are numerous diatom identification guides and floras available. Consulting them is the usual way forward. These now come in various formats, some easy to get, others less so; some easy to use, others less so. Many are focused on a particular region or area, others with a global coverage and some disregard regions altogether and focus on diatoms as a group (as a taxon).This still seems not to satisfy everybody and the quest for bigger and better, faster and more accurate methods of diatom identification is being explored, some embracing the idea that there could be a “Taxonomy-free molecular diatom index for high-throughput eDNA biomonitoring,” or even a human-free approach.

Expert biologists have a repetitive and laborious identification mission. The principal taxonomic features used to describe and classify diatoms relate to the morphology and texture of frustule. Classical taxonomic diagnosis is carried out by means of identification keys or by visual comparison with respect to standard preparations or reference iconographies. Automatic diatom identification remains an open challenge because, for instance, many diatoms that have been known by the same species for decades have subsequently been split into different species, while on the other hand the emergence of new species is continuous. The very promising results of the new deep learning techniques together with the development of new optical devices in microscopy allow to predict a significant advance in the field.","Cristóbal, G.; Blanco, S.; Bueno, G.",,"Bueno, Gloria, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-39212-3_1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Representatives of both taxa are main components of meiofaunal communities, but their role in the trophic ecology of marine and freshwater communities is not sufficiently studied. Traditional collection methods for meiofauna are optimized for Ecdysozoa, and include the use of fixatives or flotation techniques that are unsuitable for the preservation and identification of soft-bodied meiofauna. As a result, rouphozoans are usually underestimated in conventional biodiversity surveys and ecological studies. Here, we give an updated outline of their diversity and taxonomy, with some phylogenetic considerations. We describe successfully tested techniques for their recovery and study, and emphasize current knowledge on the ecology, distribution, and dispersal of freshwater gastrotrichs and microturbellarians. We also discuss the opportunities and pitfalls of (meta)barcoding studies as a means of overcoming the taxonomic impediment. Finally, we discuss the importance of rouphozoans in aquatic ecosystems and provide future research directions to fill in crucial gaps in the biology of these organisms needed for understanding their basic role in the ecology of benthos and their place in the trophic networks linking micro-, meio-, and macrofauna of freshwater ecosystems.","Balsamo, M.; Artois, T.; Smith, J.P.S.; Todaro, M.A.; Guidi, L.; Leander, B.S.; Van Steenkiste, N.W.L..",WOS:000537437000003,"Artois, Tom, T.","Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-020-04287-x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Fresh waters, Ecology, Study methods, Taxonomy, Species diversity",Journal article,,,"Univ Urbino, Dept Biomol Sci, Urbino, Italy.",Italy,Fresh waters; Ecology; Study methods; Taxonomy; Species diversity,MICROTURBELLARIAN STENOSTOMUM-SPHAGNETORUM; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; FRESH-WATER; MACROSTOMUM PLATYHELMINTHES; RHABDOCOELA PLATYHELMINTHES; CATENULIDA PLATYHELMINTHES; SPECIES DELIMITATION; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; GLOBAL DIVERSITY,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Hasselt University - Centre for Environmental Sciences (CMK),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Epipelagic fish were found to be the principal prey by number and reconstituted weight; cephalopods were the second important prey group. Small organisms prevailed in the diet of albacore tuna, with predation on juvenile fish commonplace. Albacore tuna exhibits a flexible, opportunistic feeding strategy, from ram filter feeding on abundant schooling prey to visual predation on large individuals. Prey species richness varied highly across the region. Oligotrophic conditions within the subtropical gyre of the Indian Ocean generated the most diverse mid-trophic-level communities, with less diverse communities occurring in productive areas. Albacore tuna occupies a similar trophic niche throughout the global ocean, foraging on the same prey families and even species. This study indicates overall temporal stability of the Indian Ocean and south-east Atlantic ecosystems where principal prey species remain unchanged over decades.","Romanov, E.V.; Nikolic, N.; Dhurmeea, Z.; Bodin, N.; Puech, A.; Norman, S.; Hollanda, S.; Bourjea, J.; West, W.; Potier, M.",WOS:000582546200007,"Nikolic, Natacha, N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1071/mf19332,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",South Africa,,"Habitat, ""Prey""",,"diet, reconstituted weight, south-east Atlantic Ocean, stomach contents, western Indian Ocean",Journal article,,,"CAP RUN CITEB Ctr Tech Rech & Valorisat Milieux A, Magasin 10 Port Ouest, F-97420 Le Port, Ile De La Reuni, France.",France,diet; habitat; prey; reconstituted weight; South Africa; south-east Atlantic Ocean; stomach contents; western Indian Ocean,NORTH PACIFIC ALBACORE; FEEDING ECOLOGY; YELLOWFIN TUNA; STOMACH CONTENTS; PELAGIC CEPHALOPODS; GASTRIC EVACUATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SKIPJACK TUNA; DAILY RATION,Fisheries; Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,IRD L'Institut de recherche pour le développement - PROSPER project (prospection et habitat des grands pélagiques de la ZEE de la Réunion),,France,,Research institute,Science

Zooplankton is dominated by copepods (mainly <em>Clausocalanus</em>, <em>Paracalanus</em>, <em>Oncaea</em> and <em>Oithona</em>), except in warm periods, when outbreaks of cladocerans (mainly <em>Penilia avirostris</em> but also <em>Podon intermedius</em> and <em>Pleopis polyphemoides</em>) outnumber copepods, accounting for more than 80% of total abundance on occasion. Zooplankton diversity was found to be higher in deeper waters while the density of most taxa (but not their abundance) decreased towards the ocean. On top of this general coast-ocean pattern a north–south gradient could also be distinguished resulting in three distinct zones. In relation to environmental structuring, mesoscale processes, sea surface temperature, winds, river runoff and primary productivity were identified as main factors shaping this zonation. Overall, zooplankton abundance showed a decreasing trend during the study period (2001–2015), caused by a drop of summer abundances, that was mainly driven by cladocerans.","Llope, M.; de Carvalho-Souza, G.F.; Baldo, F.; González-Cabrera, C.; Jiménez, M.P.; Licandro, P.; Vilas, C.",WOS:000552124300019,"González-Cabrera, Carmen, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102379,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Cadiz Gulf,,"Abundance, ""Community composition""",,Diversity; Spatial and seasonal variability; Copepods; Cladocerans; Guadalquivir,Journal article,,,"Ctr Oceanog Cadiz, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Muelle De Levante S-N, Cadiz 11006, Andalusia, Spain.",Spain,Diversity; Abundance; Community composition; Spatial and seasonal variability; Copepods; Qadocerans; Guadalquivir; Gulf of Cadiz,EARLY-LIFE STAGES; NORTHEAST CONTINENTAL-SHELF; PARTICULATE ORGANIC-CARBON; SOLE DICOLOGLOSSA-CUNEATA; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; GUADALQUIVIR ESTUARY; WATER MASSES; TEMPERATE ESTUARY; EUROPEAN ANCHOVY; CLIMATE-CHANGE,Oceanography,Oceanography,Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) - Centro Oceanografico de Gadiz,,Spain,,Research institute,Science

Currently, macrobenthic species are used as bioindicators of the local state of conservation by managing agencies. The population ecology monitoring of macrobenthic species with bioindicator potential is useful to recognize seasonal environmental patterns or local anthropic impactful. The research article on these data [1] will be published in the journal Ocean and Coastal Management for some interpretive insights.

Thus, Trophic Diversity and Amphideal Diversity index values increased with sedimentary ivermectin enrichment. Large amphideal foveas were more efficient for 2A-REL-Sp nematodes to avoid ivermectin.

Growth records from scales and otoliths can be used to generate long-term time series data, and in combination with environmental data, can reveal species specific population responses to a changing climate. Additionally, scale and otolith microchemical data can be utilized to investigate fish habitat usage. A common problem associated with biological collections, is that while sample intake grows, long-term physical storage is rarely a priority, and much of the sampling took place before the advent of open-access digital infrastructure. Material is often collected to meet short-term objectives and resources are seldom committed to maintaining and archiving collections. As a consequence, precious samples are frequently stored in many different and unsuitable locations, and may become lost or separated from associated metadata. The Marine Institute's ecological research station in in Newport, Co. Mayo, Ireland, holds a multi-decadal (1928–2020) collection of scales and otoliths from various fish species, gathered from many geographic locations. Here we present an open-source database model and archiving system to consolidate and digitize this collection, and show how this case study infrastructure could be used for other biological sample collections.

In previous studies, we used mitogenome sequences for reconstructing robust phylogenies, which comprised in total 120 individuals representing the majority of species (69.7%) described from this biogeographical region (except Angolan endemics) and grouped into seven genera within the family Conidae. Here, we add another 12 individuals representing endemic species that were missing in the previous studies. We use the phylogenies to identify monophyletic groups and a genetic divergence threshold (0.2% uncorrected <em>p</em> distance) to determine the number of valid species. As a result, the number of valid West African cone species could be drastically reduced to at least 40%, indicating that some recent poor-quality descriptions loosely based on phenotypic characters prone to convergence such as the shape and color patterns of the shell have contributed substantially to taxonomic inflation. Several previously accepted species with a reduced geographical distribution now become phenotypic forms of the remaining valid species, which increase their distribution ranges. In contrast, several cryptic species are now uncovered and described. For instance, <em>Africonus insulae</em> sp. nov. and <em>Kalloconus canariensis</em> sp. nov. are hereby introduced as new species. A detailed systematic account with illustrations and relevant information is presented. Lectotypes are designated for <em>Conus trochulus</em> and <em>Conus irregularis</em>, and neotypes for <em>Conus crotchii</em> and <em>Conus diminutus</em>. According to our results, it is strongly recommended that any future introduction of new taxa names for cone snails from West Africa should be supported by molecular and/or anatomical rather than exclusively shell morphological data. The taxonomic decisions here taken have direct implications for conservation and will eventually require re-evaluation of the Red List risk status of an important number of species.","Tenorio, M.J.; Abalde, S.; Pardos-Blas, J.R.; Zardoya, R.",WOS:000540325800001,"Tenorio, Manuel, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5852/ejt.2020.663,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",West Africa,Conidae,"Conservation, ""Phylogeny""",,mitochondrial genome,Journal article,,,"Univ Cadiz, Dept CMIM & Quim Inorgan, Inorgan Inst Biomol INBIO, Facultad Ciencias, 1A Planta, Cadiz 11510, Spain.",Spain,Mitochondrial genome; phylogeny; Conidae; West Africa; conservation,CAPE-VERDE CONUS; ALPHA-CONOTOXIN; PATTERNS; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; GENUS,Plant Sciences; Entomology; Zoology,Plant Sciences; Entomology; Zoology,University of Cádiz (UCA),,Spain,,University,Science

Data on the animal’s geographical location and its changes through time are used to study for instance movement patterns, habitat use and migration. The acoustic signals are detected by stand-alone receivers, allowing to collect huge amounts of data over long periods of time. However, large volumes of data might contain large errors. The traditional Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method used to calculate underwater positions, is a point-by-point approach: every position is calculated independently of all other positions. This method assumes that the acoustic transmissions follow a linear path. In many environments, this assumption is violated, for instance by reflections of the acoustic signal against hard surfaces, such as rock formations and concrete walls, or by diffractions around obstacles. Hence, acoustic positioning datasets usually require additional filtering. Unfortunately, the performance of the available filtering techniques is often unclear or ambiguous, especially when reflections occur. An alternative to the point-by-point approach, is a track-oriented approach, as used by YAPS (Yet Another Positioning System). This novel algorithm uses the information that is present in previous and subsequent positions, by combining a model of fish behaviour with Time of Arrival (TOA) of the signals on the receivers. In this study, we investigated the performance of two filtering techniques applied to positions provided by the Vemco Positioning System (VPS) in a highly reflective environment. We compared the unfiltered VPS positions with a standard filtering technique, making use of the Horizontal Positioning Error (HPE), and developed a new filter based on receiver cluster classification. Finally, we recalculated the positions with YAPS and compared the performance of this system to the two filtering techniques.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Results</h3><p>The performance of the VPS system was strongly impeded by the multiple reflections occurring in this study area, but lowering the power output of transmitters can slightly attenuate this issue.

In order to predict whether populations are able to persist or adapt to such new conditions, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of such adaptations, which ultimately get translated into these physiological responses. To explore variation in population gene expression across time and space, we investigated transcriptome-level profiles of the calanoid copepod <em>Temora longicornis</em>, that were collected at four different locations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) on three different time points (April, June, October) in 2018. RNA-seq analysis of field collected adults identified large seasonal differences in gene expression, mainly between spring-summer and autumn samples. The largest log-fold changes occurred in a set of genes encoding for ribosomal and myosin (heavy chain) transcripts. Enrichment analysis revealed a strong seasonal pattern in vitellogenin, cuticle and glycolytic gene expression as well. We also found a positive correlation between vitellogenin expression and densities of <em>T. longicornis</em>. No clear spatial variation in expression patterns was found in the BPNS.

The freshwater gastropod genus <i>Pseudamnicola</i> Paulucci, 1878 (Hydrobiidae), consisting of ∼60 species in the Mediterranean area, is widely distributed across the major islands of Majorca and Minorca. From phylogenetic datasets of limited geographic coverage, a recent well-supported split has been inferred between the Minorca and Iberian <i>Pseudamnicola</i> species, but the phylogenetic position of the Majorca clade composed of three species remained uncertain. In this study, we extend published sequence data for the COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes and the 28S rRNA nuclear gene in western Mediterranean populations of <i>Pseudamnicola</i> with homologous sequences from individuals of the non-surveyed region of Morocco to assess the origin of the Balearic species from a wider geographic perspective. Our maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses recovered a strongly supported clade comprising the Majorcan species and four phylogenetic lineages in Morocco, two of which are new to science (described here as <i>P. ramosae</i> sp. nov. and <i>P. ouarzazatensis</i> sp. nov.). Dating the nodes using an external molecular clock rate, younger ages were estimated for the Majorcan species (∼1 Mya) than for the Moroccan ones (∼5 Mya), which were still younger than the formation of the Balearic Islands (∼30 Mya). An independent well-supported clade grouped the Minorca and Iberian species diverging at ∼4 Mya.

The legacy of historical sportfish stocking in mountainous regions of western North America creates a unique, natural quasi‐experiment to investigate factors moderating invasion impacts on native communities across broad geographic and environmental gradients. Here, we synthesize fish stocking records and zooplankton relative abundance for 685 mountain lakes and ponds in the Cascade and Canadian Rocky Mountain Ranges, to reveal the effects of predatory sportfish introduction on multiple taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions of prey biodiversity. We demonstrate an innovative analytical approach, combining exploratory random forest machine learning with confirmatory multigroup analysis using multivariate partial least‐squares structural equation models, to generate and test hypotheses concerning environmental moderation of stocking impacts. We discovered distinct effects of stocking across different dimensions of diversity, including negligible (nonsignificant) impacts on local taxonomic richness (i.e. alpha diversity) and trophic structure, in contrast to significant declines in compositional uniqueness (i.e. beta diversity) and body size. Further, we found that stocking impacts were moderated by cross‐scale interactions with climate and climate‐related land‐cover variables (e.g. factors linked to treeline position and glaciers). Interactions with physical morphometric and lithological factors were generally of lesser importance, though catchment slope and habitat size constraints were relevant in certain dimensions. Finally, applying space‐for‐time substitution, a strong antagonistic (i.e. dampening) interaction between sportfish predation and warmer temperatures suggests redundancy of their size‐selective effects, meaning that warming will lessen the consequences of introductions in the future and stocked lakes may be less impacted by subsequent warming. While both stressors drive biotic homogenization, our results have important implications for fisheries managers weighing the costs/benefits of stocking—or removing established non‐native populations—under a rapidly changing climate.","Loewen, C.J.G.; Strecker, A.L.; Gilbert, B.; Jackson, D.A.",WOS:000545783900001,"Jackson, Donald, D.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.15225,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada.",Canada,aquatic invasive species; climate change; fish; functional diversity; macroecology; multiple stressors; phylogenetic diversity; zooplankton,ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BETA-DIVERSITY; STRESSORS; LAKES; SENSITIVITY; PHYLOGENIES; PREDATION; SCENARIOS; VARIANCE,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Toronto,,Canada,,University,Science

For Lord Howe Island, which lies ~600 km east of the New South Wales (NSW) mid-north coast, data from a range of taxa indicate high biodiversity and endemism, but this has not been examined for heterobranch sea slugs. To address this deficit, we collated occurrence data on sea slugs from both private and public sources, including museum records, scientific literature, field guides and citizen science activities. A total of 186 nominal (formally described) species in 82 genera and 31 families were identified from intertidal and subtidal habitats. Of these, two species are endemic to Lord Howe Island, two have not been recorded elsewhere in Australia, and 28 have not been recorded on the mainland coast of NSW.

The physiological tolerances of a species define its thermal limits, while its thermal affinity is a summary of the environmental temperatures at the localities at which it actually occurs. Experimentally derived thermal limits are known to be related to observed latitudinal ranges in marine species, but accurate range maps from which to derive latitudinal ranges are lacking for many marine species. An alternative approach is to combine widely available data on global occurrences with gridded global temperature datasets to derive measures of species‐level “thermal affinity”—that is, measures of the central tendency, variation, and upper and lower bounds of the environmental temperatures at the locations at which a species has been recorded to occur. Here, we test the extent to which such occupancy‐derived measures of thermal affinity are related to the known thermal limits of marine species using data on 533 marine species from 24 taxonomic classes and with experimentally derived critical upper temperatures spanning 2–44.5°C. We show that thermal affinity estimates are consistently and positively related to the physiological tolerances of marine species, despite gaps and biases in the source data. Our method allows thermal affinity measures to be rapidly and repeatably estimated for many thousands more marine species, substantially expanding the potential to assess vulnerability of marine communities to warming seas.","Webb, T.J.; Lines, A.; Howarth, L.M.",WOS:000540245100001,"Howarth, Leigh, L.M.","Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.6407,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"biodiversity informatics, climate change, critical temperature, gridded global sea temperature, OBIS, open biodiversity data, thermal safety margin, thermal tolerance",Journal article,,,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",England,biodiversity informatics; climate change; critical temperature; gridded global sea temperature; OBIS; open biodiversity data; thermal safety margin; thermal tolerance,CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; VULNERABILITY; TEMPERATURE; TERRESTRIAL; TOLERANCES; ECOLOGY; FISHES; LATITUDE,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,University of York,x,UK,,University,Science

The particular coastline of the mainland created several semi-enclosed embayments along the west coast of the Taiwan Strait. Runoffs from land bring large amounts of nutrients into the bays, which made these bays important natural spawning and breeding grounds for several economically important marine organisms. In order to reveal the effects of the China Coastal Current (CCC) on the zooplankton communities in Fuqing Bay in northeastern Fujian, zooplankton samples were collected at 12 stations in early March 2014. The average surface seawater temperature was 12.53 ± 0.14°C, and salinity was 28.33 ± 0.21 PSU in the investigation area during the research period. In total, 23 identified copepod species and in addition several unidentified benthic harpacticoid copepods were recorded with an average abundance of 77.44 ± 60.07 ind. m<sup>−3</sup>. In the present study, the most dominant group consisted of juveniles (copepodites) with an average density of 59.97 ± 51.49 ind. m<sup>−3</sup>, which was followed by <em>Calanus sinicus</em> Brodsky, 1965 with an average density of 5.04 ± 4.95 ind. m<sup>−3</sup>. The occurrence rate of <em>Calanus sinicus</em> was 91.67% in our study, which indicates that the research area was controlled by the CCC water mass. So, we concluded that the CCC played an important role in transporting cold water copepod species from the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea to the western Taiwan Strait. A noteworthy discovery in our samples was <em>Eurytemora pacifica</em> Sato, 1913, which was recorded for the first time in waters of the western Taiwan Strait with an occurrence rate of 33.33% and an average density of 0.81 ± 1.91 ind. m<sup>−3</sup>. <em>Eurytemora pacifica</em> was first reported at Yantai harbour and is widely distributed in waters of the northern Pacific Ocean. The co-occurrence of <em>Calanus sinicus</em> and <em>Eurytemora pacifica</em> in our research area possibly indicates that <em>E. pacifica</em> could be used as a bioindicator for the directional movement of the CCC. The high occurrence of this species in our research area indicated that the CCC affects the community structure of copepods in the western Taiwan Strait in early spring.","Wang, Y.-G.; Tseng, Li.-C.; Sun, R.-X.; Liu, Z.-Y.; Lin, M.; Hwang, J.-S.",WOS:000540781400015,"Wang, Yan-Guo, Y.-G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1163/15685403-00004010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Ctr Excellence Oceans, Keelung, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Copepod; Eurytemora pacifica; Taiwan Strait; China Coastal Current; bioindicator,CALANUS-SINICUS COPEPODA; SEASONAL SUCCESSION; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; WATERS; SEA; ABUNDANCE; ZOOPLANKTON; ASSEMBLAGES; CALANOIDA; NORTHEAST,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU),,Taiwan,,University,Science

In areas that are too large to be fully covered by the limited detection ranges of receivers or acoustic listening stations, researchers generally assume that animals are residing in an area when they are detected frequently at specific receivers. There is, however, no consensus on how this area and frequency should be spatially and temporally defined respectively, thereby introducing some unaccounted uncertainty of this residency-at-receivers. In longitudinal aquatic systems such as rivers or estuaries, strategically placed receivers are often used as gates or curtains through which tagged animals have to pass. Rather than being a proxy for the time spent near receivers, the detections can serve as boundary conditions to delineate the durations that animals spent between receivers (i.e. residency-between-receivers). As such, providing a spatial and temporal context to the detections and enabling the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. To assess the usefulness of this approach, we analyzed telemetry data for migrating eel in a longitudinal estuarine acoustic tracking network of 21 gates. Results revealed a logarithmic relationship between epistemic uncertainty and gate network resolution, which indicates that transferring information from the spatial to the temporal level has a positive effect on the epistemic uncertainty. The poor correlation between the at-receivers and the between-receivers approach indicates that the latter, although less precise, may be more accurate. It should be noted that the suggested approach assumes that the gates of receivers are perfect detectors. If tagged animals are able to pass these gates undetected the uncertainty will actually be higher than assumed. Our approach is therefore less suited for large open areas such as lagoons or seas where gates with high detection probabilities are logistically challenging. This approach allows the quantification and reduction of epistemic uncertainty by providing a spatiotemporal context to the detections. Since establishing and maintaining passive telemetry networks is generally expensive and the results these networks generate are often used in decision making, an assessment of the network quality and data uncertainty is vital.","Bruneel, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Baetens, J.M.; Coeck, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.",WOS:000564618700008,"Moens, Tom, T.","Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101133,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Epistemic uncertainty; Estuary; Fish; Gates; Network design; Passive acoustic; telemetry curtains,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Epistemic uncertainty; Estuary; Fish; Gates; Network design; Passive acoustic telemetry curtains,ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; DETECTION RANGE; RESIDENCE TIME; FISH; DESIGN; POSITIONS; BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; ARRAY,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500 terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5–60.0° latitude) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, where species richness mostly increases with warming. However, biodiversity responses are conditional on the baseline climate, such that in initially warmer locations richness increase is more pronounced while abundance declines with warming. In contrast, we do not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. As the world is committed to further warming, substantial challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of ‘climate migrants’.

However, the rate at which new taxa are discovered and described every year is still remarkably high, even in key predators such as Muricidae Rafinesque, 1815. Within this family, the genus <i>Ocenebra</i> Gray, 1847 comprises species widely distributed in the northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea that were already the target of a decadal nomenclatural, morphological, and molecular combined research. Notwithstanding, we hereby describe an additional ocenebrid endemism from the Mediterranean Sea, whose distribution appears to be restricted to a circalittoral submarine cave of the Messina Strait area (Italy). The new species <i>Ocenebra vazzanai</i> is compared with the recent Atlanto-Mediterranean congeneric taxa on the basis of the known type materials, and a table summarizing the main diagnostic features of the species is offered to facilitate future identifications. The high biodiversity highlighted in the genus <i>Ocenebra</i> reveals a wide adaptive radiation and suggests the necessity of further studies aiming to tackle biodiversity issues even in popular groups, such as molluscs, and in widely studied biogeographic areas, such as Italy, and the Mediterranean basin in genera.","Crocetta, F.; Houart, R.; Bonomolo, G.",WOS:000550881400001,"Crocetta, Fabio, F.","Department of Integrative Marine Ecology, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/jmse8060443,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Ocenebra vazzanai,"Biodiversity, ""New species""",,mussel drills; adaptive radiation; alpha taxonomy;,Journal article,,,"Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",Italy,mussel drills; adaptive radiation; biodiversity; alpha taxonomy; Ocenebra vazzanainew species,NORTHEASTERN ATLANTIC; SPECIES COMPLEX; NEOGASTROPODA; POPULATION; QUATERNARY; REVISION; PLIOCENE; FRANCE; GABES; GULF,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Engineering; Oceanography,Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli (SZN),,Italy,,Research institute,Science

Next generation sequencing was employed to study biofouling communities attached to items of different materials. A dominance of DNA from Florideophyceae, Dinophyceae and Arthropoda was found, and four non-indigenous species (NIS) were identified. Results showed a clear preference of Florideophyceae and Bryozoa to attach on textile surfaces versus plastic ones. Considering that these taxa contain several highly invasive species described to date, these data emphasize the potential of textile marine debris as a vector for dispersal of NIS. Moreover, the closest beaches to the port contained a more similar biota profile than the farther ones, confirming that both plastic and textile marine litter can be vectors for species dispersal from ports.","Ibabe, A.; Rayón, F.; Martinez, J.L.; Garcia-Vazquez, E.",WOS:000543273200020,"Garcia-Vazquez, Eva, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0228811,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Oviedo, Dept Funct Biol, C Julian Claveria S-N, Oviedo, Spain.",Spain,,MICROPLASTIC DEBRIS; SARGASSUM-MUTICUM; DEEP-SEA; INVASION; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; VECTOR; LIFE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Oviedo,x,Spain,,University,Science

This study investigated the influence of seasonal changes in water temperature on cod residency, frequenting, home range, depth change, and activity level in the BPNS and Scheldt estuary using the acoustic telemetry data from 2010 to 2019. Through Generalized Additive Mixed Modelling, the effects of seasonal change of sea surface temperature and fish length were tested. Residency and frequenting of cod followed a seasonal pattern between sites which was influenced by the seasonal variations of SST. Cod stayed in offshore artificial reefs during the warmer waters of summer (16-17°C). During winter, most fish migrated to the colder waters of the coast and estuary (<15°C). Positional change in the home range followed a similar pattern. Depth change and activity level were also affected by seasonal change in SST wherein the highest was in autumn (10-15°C) and low the rest of the year. Insights on the influence of seasonal water temperature change on the movement patterns of cod in the area will be useful in predicting its distribution in the future state of our warming seas.","Blanco, C.",,"Blanco, Clyde, C.","Ghent University, Marine Biology Research group",,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The numerous intramontane lake basins, originating by combined effects of tectonic subsidence and humid climate, accumulated thick lacustrine successions. Diagenetic overprint and leaching of these carbonate-rich deposits have facilitated insights to faunal contents for only a few basins up to the present. We contribute to filling this gap by documenting for the first time a mollusk fauna from the Bugojno Basin in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fauna originates from a coal-bearing succession representing a gradual flooding of the coastal wetlands followed upwards by the establishment of perennial lacustrine settings in the basin. Our taxonomic analyses documents 17 gastropod and two bivalve species. New to science are <i>IIllyricocongeria forcakovici</i> nov. sp., <i>Prososthenia krijgsmani</i> nov. sp. and <i>Bania goehlichae</i> nov. sp. The palaeoecological analysis based on quantified samples shows distinct shifts in mollusk composition and abundance. The terrestrial taxa are restricted to the coal-bearing interval of the section; melanopsids, neritids and hydrobiids are abundant in deltaic and littoral settings, whereas bivalves are frequent in littoral and sublittoral environments. In line with previous results, which have evidenced a high degree of intralacustrine radiation in the DLS, the Lake Bugojno fauna shows a low to moderate level of similarity to other DLS faunas.

Knowing where and what biodiversity BRI will potentially affect is crucial to plan and address its negative impacts. Using BRI transport infrastructure spatial data, we conducted a GIS analysis of the potential BRI impacts in Southeast Asia on terrestrial and marine biodiversity indicators, including protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), terrestrial ecoregions, forest cover, threatened species, and fragile ecosystems such as seagrasses, mangroves, and coral reefs. We assessed the potential impacts across four key distance thresholds (1, 5, 25, and 50 km “impact zones”) on either side of the routes. For the terrestrial routes we assessed impacts for five different types of linear rail and road infrastructure development. Within 1 km of all routes 32 PAs, 40 KBAs and 29 ecoregions are intersected. While, 142 threatened species including 26 critically endangered species are within 5 km from new rail, which are also commonly found in frontier landscapes. In marine ecosystems 20 marine PAs and 16 KBAs are intersected by BRI marine routes. We conclude by discussing ways BRI could minimise its environmental impacts and utilise its political weight to advance conservation efforts in host nations.","Ng, L.S.; Campos-Arceiz, A.; Sloan, S.; Hughes, A.C.; Tiang, D.C.F.; Li, B.V.; Lechner, A.M.",WOS:000556843900045,"Ng, Li, L.S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108691,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Belt and Road Initiative; Silk road; Maritime Silk Road; Infrastructure development; Biodiversity impacts; Biodiversity conservation; Key biodiversity areas,Journal article,,,"Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Ctr Water & Planetary Hlth, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",England,Belt and Road Initiative; Silk road; Maritime Silk Road; Infrastructure development; Biodiversity impacts; Biodiversity conservation; Key biodiversity areas,PROTECTED AREAS; CONSERVATION; CHINA; INFRASTRUCTURE; DEFORESTATION; CHALLENGES; MANGROVE; FORESTS; LAND,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Lincoln,,UK,,University,Science

These tracks were fit with a switching state-space model to characterize movements and then analyzed in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Inter-nesting movements of two turtles included separate oceanic loops, in which turtles traveled > 40 km away from nesting beaches. Four complete migrations were observed to two distinct foraging grounds, with two turtles migrating west for an average of 1064 km to the coastal waters of Ghana, and two migrating south for an average of 1563 km to a newly discovered foraging ground in the coastal waters of Angola. All migrations included intermittent foraging at stopover sites, including one period of possible oceanic foraging. Turtles at both foraging grounds maintained distinct core use areas in shallow, near-shore (< 20 km from coast) waters. Spatial and depth data reveal critical habitats for this population throughout inter-nesting, post-nesting, and foraging behaviors. Tracks spanned nine countries, highlighting the need for multi-national cooperation in the development of marine conservation management plans in the area. The long distances covered by these turtles suggests that fisheries bycatch and direct harvest throughout the East Atlantic may impact this population.

Understanding the influence of passive continental margin geometry on shallow and deep hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes. PhD Thesis. University of Sydney, School of Geosciences: Sydney. xvi, 149 pp.","The hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes that operate on submerged passive continental margins are often difficult to study due to their remoteness and the sparse data coverage associated with these regions. Numerical simulations provide a powerful experimental framework to investigate such physical processes. In this thesis, a variety of numerical models are used to provide process-based insights into the regional-scale hydrodynamic and sedimentary consequences of margin flows. Margin geometry plays a critical role in preconditioning and modifying three types of flows: along-slope flows, down-shelf and down-slope flows, and cross-shelf flows. In a study of along-slope flows, ocean sea-ice model results indicate that contourite drifts, which are anomalously high accumulations of deep-sea sediments, form in areas that exhibit vigorous bottom current activity. Simulations show that bottom current speeds fluctuate more over contourites, suggesting that contourite formation can be attributed to repeated acute, high-energy bottom current events rather than continuous accumulation under ambient background flow. In a study of down-shelf and down-slope flows, surface and marine process-based simulations indicate that carbonate platforms play a fundamental role in the regional geomorphological development of the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic Great Barrier Reef margin. Finally, in a study of cross-shelf flows, tsunami propagation simulations show that coral reef ecosystems offer varying degrees of protection to the coastline. Various factors related to bathymetry dictate the degree of wave energy attenuation by coral cover. These findings highlight the importance of site-specific seafloor geometry in modulating hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes in margin settings. Additionally, they also provide new mechanistic insights into the hydrodynamic and sedimentary consequences of topographically-mediated margin flows.","Thran, A.C.",,"Thran, Amanda, A.C.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

NIS distribution in Mediterranean ports showed a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of studies across the whole basin, with a limited knowledge on both specific taxa and geographical areas, as well as a generally low proportion of investigated ports. The low rate of specific studies designed to monitor these particular environments may represent the main source of knowledge gaps.

One of the key anatomical characters of lyonsiellids is the reduction of the gill filaments in size and number and an increase of amount of muscles and connective tissue in gills, so their ctenidia represent an intermediate stage between eulamellibranch and septibranch conditions. The family Lyonsiellidae presently includes four genera: <em>Lyonsiella</em>, <em>Allogramma</em>, <em>Policordia</em> and <em>Dallicordia</em>. Taxonomy of the family is still problematic at both generic and species levels. The genus <em>Dallicordia</em>, typified by<em> Lyonsiella alaskana</em> was established on the assumption that it has no gills but possesses a muscular septum pierced by ostia, in contrast to the other lyonsiellids that have filamentous gills. Additionally, <em>Lyonsiella uschakovi</em> and <em>Policordia ochotica</em> were tentatively assigned to the new genus. Later <em>P. ochotica</em> was synonymized with <em>P. media</em>. In this paper we show that actually the <em>Dallicordia</em> was typified by an undescribed species misidentified as <em>Lyonsiella alaskana</em> which we describe here as <em>D. <strong>bernardi</strong></em> sp. nov.

On the deep seafloor, sediment variability and hard-substrate availability influence geographic patterns of species richness and turnover. The assumption of a generally homogeneous, sedimented abyssal seafloor is at odds with the fact that the faunal diversity in some abyssal regions exceeds that of shallow-water environments. Here we show, using a ground-truthed analysis of multibeam sonar data, that the deep seafloor may be much rockier than previously assumed.

Here, we explored whether variations in surface phytoplankton assemblages across Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean stations can explain structural changes in bathypelagic (ca. 4,000 m) free‐living and particle‐attached prokaryotic communities (characterized through 16S rRNA gene sequencing), as well as changes in prokaryotic activity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality. We show that the spatial structuring of prokaryotic communities in the bathypelagic strongly followed variations in the abundances of surface dinoflagellates and ciliates, as well as gradients in surface primary productivity, but were less influenced by bathypelagic physicochemical conditions. Amino acid‐like DOM components in the bathypelagic reflected variations of those components in surface waters, and seemed to control bathypelagic prokaryotic activity. The imprint of surface conditions was more evident in bathypelagic than in shallower mesopelagic (200–1,000 m) communities, suggesting a direct connectivity through fast‐sinking particles that escape mesopelagic transformations. Finally, we identified a pool of endemic deep‐sea prokaryotic taxa (including potentially chemoautotrophic groups) that appear less connected to surface processes than those bathypelagic taxa with a widespread vertical distribution. Our results suggest that surface planktonic communities shape the spatial structure of the bathypelagic microbiome to a larger extent than the local physicochemical environment, likely through determining the nature of the sinking particles and the associated prokaryotes reaching bathypelagic waters.","Ruiz-González, C.; Mestre, M.; Estrada, M.; Sebastian, M.; Salazar, G.; Agusti, S.; Moreno-Ostos, E.; Reche, I.; Alvarez-Salgado, X.A.; Morán, X.A.G.; Duarte, C.M.; Sala, M.M.; Gasol, J.M.",WOS:000535017200001,"Ruiz-González, Clara, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/mec.15454,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar ICM, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",Spain,bacterial activity; carbon export; deep ocean; fluorescent dissolved organic matter; marine prokaryotic communities; microbial dispersal; particle sinking; particle-attached; surface phytoplankton,ORGANIC-CARBON; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; WATER COLUMN; BACTERIOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SINKING VELOCITY; EXPORT; BACTERIA; PACIFIC,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

The assemblages allowed to identify periods of higher and lower marine/continental influence in the study area and to infer events of marine ingressions or regressions during the late Pleistocene, associated with the penultimate marine transgression (123,000 years before the Present). Foraminifera were found in the upper part of both well-cores but they are more abundant in one of the studied well-core. Based on biofacies, the paleoenvironmental conditions and the complex dynamic estuarine evolution were analyzed. Seven foraminiferal biofacies associated with sea-level oscillations were determined throughout cluster analysis, as well as dominant and indicator species in the two well-cores. In the well-core (2-MU-1-RJ) with a higher abundance of foraminifera was identified the following environmental succession: (i) an inner shelf evolving to an estuarine environment; (ii) a return to marine shelf conditions; (iii) followed by the establishment of a lagoon system towards the well-core top. On the other well-core (2-BG-1-RJ), it can be observed the change of estuarine environment under the strong fluvial influence at the bottom of the studied interval; followed by an increase of marine influence from the middle toward the upper part of the well-core. The benthic foraminiferal absence in the samples at the top of the well-cores suggests an abrupt change from marine to the non-marine environment. The two well-cores were compared and the results contribute to the understanding of the estuarine complex dynamics of PSDC in late Pleistocene based on benthic foraminifera biofacies and their paleoecology in marine sediments of the upper portion of the well-cores.

This study contributes in providing a robust and cost-efficient framework for investigating OWFs over a large sea area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first spatiotemporally-detailed inventory of OWFs, which will complement official databases.

Thus, the taxonomic identification process usually occurs by visual comparison and by verifying the description of morphological attributes, which requires the previous knowledge of the species before identification. The use of an identification key seeks to help in this crucial step and contribute to the best taxonomic precision, which errors may propagate in the subsequent analyses that are supported by estimations on species richness and abundances. Moreover, it constitutes an extra tool to assist in the training of new researchers.

This study assesses how the presence of biogenic component of benthic habitats affects the taxonomic richness and functional diversities of a seamount benthos. We used a variety of complementary metrics on abundance data and quantitative community analyses to detail the composition, structure, diversity and functionality of eight biogenic and five non-biogenic benthic habitats across the Seco de los Olivos Seamount, located to the south of the Iberian Peninsula, in the western Mediterranean. This study shows that the presence of habitat-forming species in benthic habitats increases richness and enhances α and functional diversities. Their influence is more evident in soft and mixed bottoms, where the multiplying effect on structural complexity is proportionally greater than in rocky habitats. Biogenic habitats hosted a higher number of single species in comparison with non-biogenic habitats. The presence of habitat-forming species also determines β diversity among habitats at similar depth and type of substrate, with variation in species richness responsible for the most β diversity; turnover, however, dominated β diversity among habitats of different environments. Species richness hotspots were also associated to biogenic structures and were found restricted to the summit of the central guyot and other areas located on the surrounding ridges. Different functional composition of these benthic habitats also suggested differences in ecosystem functioning: biogenic habitats resembled more stable or at advanced stages of successional maturity than non-biogenic habitats and are characterized by biological traits that allow them to better promote benthic-pelagic coupling. From a conservation perspective an increased functional redundancy was found related to the occurrence of habitat-forming species in high abundance, which favours functional replacement and makes communities less vulnerable to environmental changes. The results of this study can help managers to develop specific management tools to ensure the future evaluation and monitoring of benthic communities.","de la Torriente, A.; Aguilar, R.; González-Irusta, J.M.; Blanco, M.; Serrano, A.",WOS:000578967500042,"Blanco, Marian, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106747,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Habitat-forming species; Biogenic habitat; Biodiversity; Fidelity; Biological traits; Ecosystem functioning,Journal article,,,"Inst Espanol Oceanog, Promontorio San Martin S-N, Santander 39004, Spain.",Spain,Habitat-forming species; Biogenic habitat; Biodiversity; Fidelity; Biological traits; Ecosystem functioning,BETA-DIVERSITY; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; SPAWNING GROUNDS; NORTH-SEA; MARINE; INDICATOR; NESTEDNESS; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO),,Spain,,Research institute,Science

The latter in turn may force individuals to relocate to new sites for foraging or breeding, both of which presumably entails fitness costs due the trade-offs of finding and exploring new habitats. Species showing a high level of spatial foraging specialisation or nest site fidelity are expected to be most vulnerable. In this study, we explored the consequences of nest site loss on the reproductive investment of lesser black-backed gulls (<em>Larus fuscus</em>), a site faithful seabird species breeding in an urban environment. We monitored a population of 1.173 colour-ringed gulls across 13 years, that involved several episodes of spatially restricted loss of breeding habitat. We found that birds which lost their breeding territories reduced their investment into the eggs as reflected in a decrease of the clutch volume. They relocated over larger distances compared to birds that relocated voluntarily. Moreover, the likelihood of skipping the subsequent breeding season increased after a forced relocation. These negative effects of forced relocation likely contribute to the decline in the number of breeding pairs in our urban population as observed during the last ten years, and highlights the importance of maintaining a stable breeding environment in urban areas for the conservation of this and potentially other colonial breeding seabird species.","Salas, R.; Müller, W.; Vercruijsse, H.; Lens, L.; Stienen, E.",WOS:000536149100012,"Stienen, Eric, E.",Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO),https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108550,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Competition; Urban ecology; Seabirds; Habitat loss; Anthropogenic change; Conservation,Journal article,,,"Univ Antwerp, Behav Ecol & Ecophysiol BECO, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",Belgium,Competition; Urban ecology; Seabirds; Habitat loss; Anthropogenic change; Conservation,BREEDING DISPERSAL; MATE FIDELITY; CHICK GROWTH; EVOLUTION; PREDATION; GULL; SURVIVAL; SUCCESS; BIRDS; SELECTION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

It comprises two main groups, containing northern hemisphere (Laurasian) and predominantly southern hemisphere (Gondwanan) taxa respectively, treated here as separate superfamilies. Within Punctoidea sensu stricto, Punctidae, Cystopeltidae and Endodontidae form separate monophyletic clades, but Charopidae, as currently interpreted, is paraphyletic. Most of the charopid taxa that we sequenced, including <i>Charopa coma</i> (Gray, 1843) and other Charopinae, grouped in a clade with Punctidae but some charopid taxa from Australia and South America grouped with Cystopeltidae. Cystopeltidae previously contained a single Australia-endemic genus, <i>Cystopelta</i> Tate, 1881, but our analysis suggests that it is considerably more diverse taxonomically and has a much wider distribution. For taxonomic stability, we suggest that Charopidae be retained as a family-level group for now, pending further study of the systematic relationships of its constituent taxa. A new superfamily, Discoidea, is erected here for two Northern Hemisphere families, Discidae and Oreohelicidae, which were previously assigned to Punctoidea. The North American species <i>Radiodomus abietum</i>, previously in Charopidae, is also here assigned to Discoidea. The phylogenetic relationships of Helicodiscidae, previously assigned to Punctoidea, were not fully resolved in our analysis, but the family is apparently closely related to Arionoidea Gray, 1840 and infraorder Limacoidei.","Salvador, R.B.; Brook, F.J.; Shepherd, L.D.; Kennedy, M.",WOS:000542789800001,"Brook, Fred, F.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/zse.96.53660,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Discoidea,,,"Bayesian Inference, Discoidea, Helicodiscidae, land snails, maximum likelihood",Journal article,,,"Museum New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, 169 Tory St, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Bayesian Inference; Discoidea; Helicodiscidae; land snails; maximum likelihood,LAND SNAILS GASTROPODA; TERRESTRIAL GASTROPODS; FOSSIL LAND; EARLY/MIDDLE MIOCENE; MIDDLE MIOCENE; CENTRAL-EUROPE; PULMONATA; MOLLUSCA; WESTERN; CLASSIFICATION,Zoology,Zoology,Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa,,New Zealand,,Museum,Science

The SIMPER analysis revealed that the average dissimilarity between nematode communities increased with increasing doses of ciprofloxacin. Two dimensional (2D) non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plots and relative abundances of functional groups of nematode genus assemblages revealed that all functional trait abundances were affected, particularly with the highest dose. However, only the amphid shape and feeding group functions showed a clear distribution separation between the control and ciprofloxacin treatments. The nMDS second-stage ordination of inter-matrix rank correlations for matrices including genus and functional traits showed that the tail shape was the closest functional trait to the generic distribution. Thus, only the curves of cumulative dominance related to the tail shape mirrored discernibly the sedimentary concentrations in ciprofloxacin.","Nasri, A.; Allouche, M.; Hannachi, A.; Harrath, A.H.; Aldahmash, W.; Alwasel, S.; Mahmoudi, E.; Beyrem, H.; Boufahja, F.",WOS:000582219300004,"Mahmoudi, Ezzeddine, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111084,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Meiobenthic taxa; Nematode genera; Ciprofloxacin; Sediment contamination; Functional traits; Population evolution,Journal article,,,"Univ Carthage, Fac Sci Bizerte, Lab Biomonitoring Environm, Zarzouna 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia.",Tunisia,Meiobenthic taxa; Nematode genera; Ciprofloxacin; Sediment contamination; Functional traits; Population evolution,ENVIRONMENTAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; MARINE NEMATODE COMMUNITY; FREE-LIVING NEMATODE; WASTE-WATER; VETERINARY ANTIBIOTICS; PENICILLIN-G; PHARMACEUTICALS; RIVER; FATE; BIODEGRADATION,Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,University of Carthage - Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte - Environmental Biomonitoring Lab,x,Tunisia,,Research institute,Science

Most of the examined material was obtained by staff of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Honolulu, during surveys for nonindigenous marine species in shallow, sheltered, inshore or nearshore waters, and especially in harbours, bays, and lagoons. In all, 34 species of leptothecate hydroids, assigned to 14 families and 20 genera, were identified and are discussed. One of them, based on a single infertile colony with a damaged hydrotheca, was identified provisionally only to the rank of suborder. Given the limited geographic and bathymetric focus of the surveys, only four of the species, <em>Clytia thornelyi</em>, <em>Halecium sibogae</em>, <em>Macrorhynchia balei</em>, and <em>M. hawaiensis</em>, were collected at depths greater than 25 m.

However, the success of this approach is greatly dependent on the availability, taxonomic coverage and reliability of reference sequences in genetic databases, whose deficiencies can potentially compromise species identifications at the taxonomic assignment step. In this study we assessed lacunae in availability of DNA sequence data from four barcodes (COI, 18S, rbcL and matK) for NIS occurring in European marine and coastal environments. NIS checklists were based on EASIN and AquaNIS databases. The highest coverage was found for COI for Animalia and rbcL for Plantae (up to 63%, for both) and 18S for Chromista (up to 51%), that greatly increased when only high impact species were taken into account (up to 82 to 89%). Results show that different markers have unbalanced representations in genetic databases, implying that the parallel use of more than one marker can act complimentarily and may greatly increase NIS identification rates through DNA-based tools. Furthermore, based on the COI marker, data for approximately 30% of the species had maximum intra-specific distances higher than 3%, suggesting that many NIS may have undescribed or cryptic diversity. Although completing the gaps in reference libraries is essential to make the most of the potential of the DNA-based tools, a careful compilation, verification and annotation of available sequences is fundamental to assemble large curated and reliable reference libraries that provide support for rigorous species identifications.","Duarte, S.; Costa, F.O.",,"Costa, Filipe, F.O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/mbmg.4.55162,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"BOLD, DNA barcode markers, gap-analysis, GenBank, marine and coastal ecosystems, non-indigenous species",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the deeper stations, only the bivalve taxon was dominant, even though exhibiting a much lower species richness and abundance. On the overall, the molluscan species were ascribed to 6 feeding guilds: Suspension and deposit feeders were the dominant trophic groups, occurring at all stations along the bathymetrical gradient, while predators, detritus feeders, ecto-parasites and scavengers were poorly represented and mainly occurred in the shallowest stations. The mollusc composition and distribution pattern along the bathymetrical gradient over time show signs of structural stability that might be mainly due to the continuous supply of organic matter from the river mouth expanding to all area.

The boundary of their distribution did not coincide with the boundaries of assemblages defined for the other groups of the trawl zoobenthos. In the southwestern part of the Laptev Sea it coincided with the boundary between positive and negative near-bottom temperatures, and in the New Siberian shoal it coincided with a 28 PSU isohaline. The coastal assemblage was dominated by species that were widespread in the sea area. Only five carnivorous and detritovorous species were typical for the complex.

The results showed that the phytoplankton community consisted of 58 genera and 116 species, showing a relatively simple distribution.

The phytoplankton cell density ranged from 10.0 to 2,904.0 cells mL<sup>-1</sup>, with an average layer of 577.2 cells mL<sup>-1</sup>, which was low in autumn and high in winter. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton dominant species was mainly centric diatoms from winter to summer, including <i>Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii</i>,                    <i>Cerataulina bergonii</i>, and <i>Skeletonema costatum</i>-ls in winter, <i>S. costatum</i>-ls and <i>C. bergonii</i> in spring, and <i>Eucampia zodiacus</i> and <i>Th. nordenskioeldii</i> in summer.

Forty-two genera of free-living nematodes belonging to 17 families were identified. <em>Daptonema</em>, <em>Ptycholaimellus</em>, and <em>Promonhystera</em> were the most abundant taxa in the area. The nematode assemblage structure was negatively affected by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and total organic matter (TOM), with an impact gradient from the polluted Power Plant (PP), over Khur Gursuzan (KG), to the cleaner ‘Resalat’ site (RE). The PP sites, characterized by industrial infrastructures, were mainly impacted by PCBs, while Khur Gursuzan (KG) is under the influence of domestic discharges, with high sedimentary TOM levels. However, PCBs and TOM seem closely associated and they likely lead to compounding effects on the fauna. Among the bioindicator genera found, <em>Spirinia</em>, <em>Chromadorina,</em> and <em>Terschellingia</em> may be recognized as resistant taxa to PCBs, while <em>Daptonema, Sabateria, Promonhystera</em> and <em>Ptycholaimellus</em> are opportunists able to exploit organic load, and <em>Oncholaimus</em> and <em>Pomponema</em> appeared sensitive genera being characteristic to unpolluted sediments. As expected, the spatial effects between the stations and concomitantly the different types of anthropogenic impacts played a much more important role than seasonal variability and related changes. This confirms that anthropogenic impact can be a major control factor at Persian Gulf beaches. Nematode female:male ratios were in favor of the females, especially in the sediments impacted by PCBs, corroborating the hypothesis that stressful conditions sustain the increasing female frequency in nematode populations. In terms of the ecological quality (EcoQ) status, genus percentages indicated lower EcoQ at PP and highest at RE. In contrast, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H’) did not detect variations of EcoQ status at the three locations, while the Maturity Index did not indicate the presence of stressful conditions at PP, but it did at KG. It is possible that MI performs better when considering organic pollution compared to PCB contamination. However, we do not recommend its use in intertidal or transitional areas that are characterized by strong natural variations of the physical and chemical variables.","Sahraeian, N.; Sahafi, H.H.; Mosallanejad, H.; Ingels, J.; Semprucci, F.",WOS:000578967500006,"Ingels, Jeroen, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106697,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Polychlorinated biphenyls; Organic enrichment; Meiofauna; Intertidal beach; Sex ratio,Journal article,,,"Univ Urbino, Dept Biomol Sci DiSB, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",Italy,Polychlorinated biphenyls; Organic enrichment; Meiofauna; Intertidal beach; Sex ratio,ECOLOGICAL QUALITY STATUS; DIOXIN-LIKE PCBS; SANDY-BEACH; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; BACTERIVOROUS NEMATODES; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; ZONATION PATTERNS; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; MARINE; MEIOFAUNA,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Urbino Carlo Bo,x,Italy,,University,Science

The implementation of biofouling monitoring programs allows for better fouling management and also for the early identification of NIS. However, few monitoring studies have used recent methods, such as metabarcoding, that can significantly enhance the detection of those species. Here, we employed monthly monitoring of biofouling growth on stainless steel plates in the Atlantic Port of Leixões (Northern Portugal), over one year to test the effect of commercial anti-corrosion paint in the communities. Fouling organisms were identified by combining morpho-taxonomy identification with community DNA metabarcoding using multiple markers (16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 23S rRNA, and COI genes). The dominant colonizers found at this location were hard foulers, namely barnacles and mussels, while other groups of organisms such as cnidarians, bryozoans, and ascidians were also abundant. Regarding the temporal dynamics of the fouling communities, there was a progressive increase in the colonization of cyanobacteria, green algae, and red algae during the sampled period with the replacement of less abundant groups. The tested anticorrosion paint demonstrated to have a significant prevention effect against the biofouling community resulting in a biomass reduction. Our study also reports, for the first time, 29 NIS in this port, substantiating the need for the implementation of recurring biofouling monitoring programs in ports and harbours.","Azevedo, J.; Antunes, J.T.; Machado, A.M.; Vasconcelos, V.; Leão, P.N.; Froufe, E.",WOS:000561123700037,"Azevedo, Joana, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-70307-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CIIMAR CIMAR, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Matosinhos, Portugal.",Portugal,,RNA GENE DATABASE; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; PRIMARY COLONIZATION; ARTIFICIAL SURFACES; EARLY SUCCESSION; MARINE; SEQUENCES; BIOFILMS; IDENTIFICATION; ASSEMBLAGES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR),,Portugal,,Research institute,Science

The coral holobiont comprises a diverse microbiome including dinoflagellate algae (Dinophyceae; Symbiodiniaceae), bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, but here we focus on the Symbiodiniaceae as knowledge of the impact of other microbial symbionts on coral evolution is scant. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has extended the coral's metabolic capacity through metabolic handoffs and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and has contributed to the ecological success of these iconic organisms. It necessitated the prior existence or the evolution of a series of adaptations of the host to attract and select the right symbionts, to provide them with a suitable environment and to remove disfunctional symbionts. Signatures of microbial symbiosis in the coral genome include HGT from Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, gene family expansions, and a broad repertoire of oxidative stress response and innate immunity genes. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has permitted corals to occupy oligotrophic waters as the algae provide most corals with the majority of their nutrition. However, the coral–Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis is sensitive to climate warming, which disrupts this intimate relationship, causing coral bleaching, mortality and a worldwide decline of coral reefs.","van Oppen, M.J.H.; Medina, M.",WOS:000561380500004,"Medina, Mónica, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rstb.2019.0591,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.",Australia,Scleractinia; Symbiodiniaceae; microbiome; holobiont; symbiosis,GENE-EXPRESSION; HOLOGENOME THEORY; REEF CORALS; SEA-ANEMONE; HEAT-STRESS; RESILIENCE; GENOME; LIGHT; ALGAE; MICROENVIRONMENT,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS),x,,,,

This research aims to analyze macrozoobenthos community structure in the Pasir Island that has not been documented. Surveys were carried out in the rainy season. In this study, a total of 10 sampling locations were classified into two different groups that represent “control” and “disturbed” station. The main structural parameters of the macrozoobenthos identified at each station were specific richness (S), abundance (number of individuals m<sup>-2</sup>, N) and the Pielou’s index (J). Additionally, the pairwise comparison between groups was conducted by using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and the similarity percentage (SIMPER) to obtain the description of community structure. A total of 1054 specimens were counted from the “control” and “disturbed” stations. These specimens belonged to five animal classes, namely, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Malacostraca, Cephalopoda and Echinoidea. ANOSIM and SIMPER analysis demonstrated that a significant difference was found between “control“ and&nbsp; “disturbed“ stations with the percentage of dissimilarity value of 88.82%. In addition, environmental variables such pH, salinity and type of substrates contributed significantly to this difference.

We not only show that a continental-scale system is the cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. Transmission is key to low cost, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, the transmission grid size is comparable to today’s, albeit with expanded cross-border capacities. The largest differences across scales concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is concentrated on the European periphery, where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not between geographic scale and cost, but between scale and the spatial distribution of required generation and transmission infrastructure.","Tröndle, T.; Lilliestam, J.; Marelli, S.; Pfenninger, S.",WOS:000571389400013,"Tröndle, Tim, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.joule.2020.07.018,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Energy; decarbonization; self-sufficiency; cooperation; trade; transmission; regional equity; land use; acceptance; flexibility,Journal article,,,"Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Switzerland,,LEVELIZED COST; ENERGY SYSTEM; POWER-SYSTEM; STORAGE; WIND; REANALYSIS; DECARBONIZATION; TRANSMISSION; INTEGRATION; DEPLOYMENT,"Chemistry, Physical; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science,Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,,Switzerland,,Research institute,Science

In metabarcoding, a public sequence database is typically used to match barcodes to species identity, but these databases are naturally incomplete. The North Sea oil and gas industry conducts large-scale environmental monitoring programs in one of the most heavily sampled marine areas worldwide and could therefore be considered a “best-case scenario” for macrofaunal metabarcoding. As a test case, we investigated the database coverage of two common metabarcoding markers, mitochondrial COI and the ribosomal rRNA 18S gene, for a complete list of 1802 macrofauna taxa reported from the North Sea monitoring region IV. For COI, species level barcode coverage was 50.4% in GenBank and 42.4% for public sequences in BOLD. For 18S, species level coverage was 36.4% in GenBank and 27.1% in SILVA. To see whether rare species were underrepresented, we investigated the most commonly reported species as a separate dataset but found only minor coverage increases. We conclude that compared to global figures, barcode coverage is high for this area, but that a significant effort remains to fill barcode databases to levels that would make metabarcoding operational as a taxonomic tool, including for the most common macrofaunal taxa.","Hestetun, J.T.; Bye-Ingebrigtsen, E.; Nilsson, R.H.; Glover, A.G.; Johansen, P.-O.; Dahlgren, T.G.",WOS:000560432400001,"Johansen, Per-Otto, P.-O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-020-01093-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, POB 463, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Sweden,Barcodes; Biomonitoring; North Sea; Benthic; COI; 18S,ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; WHALE-FALL; DIVERSITY; TOOL; BIOLOGY; LIFE,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Gothenburg - Department of Marine Sciences,x,Sweden,,University,Science

Chaetognaths are zooplankton predators whose abundances may serve as control to overall plankton biomass in such productive waters. This study aims to compare and characterize chaetognath assemblages associated with structural attributes between high and low production areas within an upwelling area. Zooplankton were collected in February 2013 during an upwelling season using a 45cm-diameter NORPAC net with a 200um mesh bag attached to it. Three depth intervals (0-65m, 65-135m and 135-200m) were examined in each station for the vertical profiling of zooplankton. The mean zooplankton biomass for the high (Stn 24) and low (Stn 22) production stations were 51.8 ml 100m<sup>-3</sup> and 75.8 ml 100m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. A total of 993 chaetognaths with an average density of 47.5 ind. m<sup>-3</sup> were collected from the Stn 24, and only 334 individuals accounting for an average density of 10.6 ind. m<sup>-3</sup> from the Stn 22. The results show an aggregation of chaetognaths in the surface layer of the two stations, particularly in the high production station, contributing 80.96 ind. m<sup>-3</sup> to the total zooplankton. <i>Flacisagitta enflata</i> was the most dominant species found in both stations.

The high productivity of mangroves creates a suitable living habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms, including bivalves. Several bivalve species are collected as food for humans. Despite the insufficient information regarding the interaction between mangroves and bivalves, this aspect is essential for resource and habitat management. Furthermore, the total number of identified bivalve species living in mangroves is still unknown. Therefore, this article presents a review of the diversity and interaction between bivalves and mangroves in the Southeast Asia region. Published data on distribution of bivalve species in mangroves were listed and checked using online databases and datasets from international organisations. This review will serve as baseline information on the biodiversity of bivalves in Southeast Asia for future studies, although some of the species listed require further validation from taxonomists. A total of 175 species from 34 families, 87 genera and 4 unidentified species of bivalves were recorded in Southeast Asia. The highest number of species was found in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, which surround the South China Sea, whereas no data for Laos could be obtained. Six species were listed as invasive alien species by the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) and the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) but not recorded as invasive in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, six species were classified as Least Concern, 71 were categorised as Not Evaluated, and the remaining 98 were not included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. These statuses indicate that the current use of bivalves in the Southeast Asia region is still sustainable. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring should be conducted to provide appropriate data for proper management.","Yahya, N.; Idris, I.; Rosli, N.S.; Bachok, Z.",WOS:000567896900006,"Bachok, Zainudin, Z.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101382,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,Mangrove wetland; Bivalves; Distribution; Southeast Asia,Journal article,,,"Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Oceanog & Environm, South China Sea Repository & Reference Ctr, Terengganu 21030, Malaysia.",Malaysia,Mangrove wetland; Bivalves; Distribution; Southeast Asia,MARINE SHELLED MOLLUSCA; POLYMESODA-EROSA; WEST MALAYSIA; GELOINA-EROSA; MUD CLAM; DIVERSITY; BAY; ECOSYSTEMS; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT),,Malaysia,,University,Science

However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5° latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5° latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (°C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km<sup>2</sup>) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O<sub>2</sub> (ml l<sup>−1</sup>) and nitrate (μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20° N and 15°–25° S, not at the equator. This can suggest that temperature is probably the key driver of latitudinal gradients of mangrove crabs’ species richness. Species richness and mangrove area were also highly correlated.","Sharifian, S.; Kamrani, E.; Saeedi, H.",WOS:000569089000003,"Sharifian, Sana, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102692,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Endemicity; Geographic region; Latitudinal diversity gradient; Mangrove distribution; Ocypodoidae; Sea surface temperature,Journal article,,,"Univ Hormozgan, Fishery Dept, Bandar Abbas, Iran.",Iran,Endemicity; Geographic region; Latitudinal diversity gradient; Mangrove distribution; Ocypodoidae; Sea surface temperature,DIVERSITY GRADIENT; EXTINCTION RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE; BRACHYURA; PATTERNS; RANGE; SESARMIDAE; CRUSTACEA; DECAPODA,Biology; Zoology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Zoology,Hormozgan University,,Iran,,University,Science

In France, <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> is present in Mediterranean lagoons and estuaries along La Manche Sea. <i>Mnemiopsis</i> was first recorded in the Berre Lagoon in early 2000. This lagoon has been highly perturbated for years, with a large volume of freshwater inflow through natural rivers and a succession of large hydroelectric power plants, inducing important eutrophication. Legislation has been implemented to improve the health status of the lagoon since 1994. A long-term study was undertaken in 2010 to measure <i>Mnemiopsis</i> population dynamics, and to identify the main drivers of its persistence in this highly anthropogenic lagoon. In 2011 and 2012, during extreme winter conditions, populations of this ctenophore were not observed for months. Its re-appearance later in year could be linked to either a new introduction from the Mediterranean Sea or the existence of retention areas where individuals sought refugia.

Time-series analysis on interannual variability of meteorological factors influencing sea level in the Southern Bight of the North Sea. MSc Thesis. Universiteit Antwerpen/Gent University/Vrije Universiteit Brussel: Antwerpen, Gent, Brussel. 83 pp.","Temperature and sea level are primary indicators of global climate change (GCOSa,2019). Sea level variability on short time scales such as waves and tides can easily be averaged out as opposed to atmospherically induced interannual and decadal variability which is found to be irregular. The latter conceals the climatic trend and the fact that interannual variability usually is in the order of decimeters while climatic sea level rise is typically only estimated to be a few millimeters per year, complicates the analysis even further (Gerkema and Duran-Matute, 2017.This dissertation uses intelligible machine learning methods to gain insight into the monthly and annual mean sea level data that was obtained via the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) for the stations Ostend and Nieuwpoort. These stations lie in the southern bight of the North Sea. By utilising generalised additive models, the goal is to combine the advantage of decomposability of a simple linear model, with the added benefit of enhanced performance due to the estimation of more complex relationships between the independent and dependent variables. This 1) permits the formulation of formal relationships between factors in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) that influence sea level variability and 2) increases the understanding of the mechanistic relationships of the physical forces that drive sea level variability at the Belgian coast. They also serve as the basis for the formation of new hypotheses for future research.What follows is a selection of the conclusions drawn from the results obtained in the present study: •Moderately positive linear relations were found for westerly winds and sea level in Ostend. Easterly winds correlate moderately negative with sea level. •Generalised additive models have shown promising potential to model annual and monthly mean sea level and to analyse time series of physical variables. •According to the models derived in the present study, sea level has risen approximately 2.8 mm/year during the time period 1979-2017. •The models for seawater temperature have not yielded a linear yearly trend. The results presented here show a seawater temperature change of -2 C/century between 1903-1913, +0.8 C/century between 1949-1965, +0.53 _C between 1950-1959, +4.6 C between 1979-2017 and +3.4 C between 2001-2019. •On average the wind energy has decreased between 1979-2017 with 0.53 J/s.

The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is implemented over the SBNS with 5 km resolution and downscaled at 1 km resolution over the BCZ in a two-way nesting configuration run over a three years period (i.e. 2006–2008). The benefit of using a high resolution model over the BCZ is assessed through an extensive comparison of model results with data from satellite and in-situ fixed platforms as well as reference products available for the region. The validation exercise and the results analysis are conducted with a particular focus on hydrodynamic features that are expected to impact the sediment transport. We find that despite the validation procedure does not allow to clearly demonstrate better performance of the high resolution model compared to the coarse resolution model in terms of overtidal circulation, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS), the high resolution model resolves additional details in the variability of residual circulation and Scheldt salinity plume dynamics. The analysis of the response of the simulated hydrodynamics to atmospheric regimes for neap and spring tide highlights the major role played by the wind direction on the averaged currents and plume extension. The strongest currents and minimum plume extension are obtained under southwestern winds and neap tide while when northeastern winds prevail, the plume extension is at its maximum and the circulation is the weakest. We show that while neap tides allow the establishment of streamlined circulation, the spring tides induce more turbulent circulation which can favor the retention of transported elements. This latter property could not be resolved with the 5 km resolution model.","Ivanov, E.; Capet, A.; Barth, A.; Delhez, E.J.M.; Soetaert, K.; Grégoire, M.",WOS:000575784800002,"Soetaert, Karline, K.",EDS,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocemod.2020.101682,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Hydrodynamic variability; Ocean modeling; Belgian Coastal Zone; Southern Bight of the North Sea,Journal article,,,"Univ Liege, MAST AGO, Bat B5a,Allee 6 Aout 19, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",Belgium,Hydrodynamic variability; Ocean modeling; Belgian Coastal Zone; Southern Bight of the North Sea,COASTAL-OCEAN MODEL; ERROR QUANTIFICATION; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; CHLOROPHYLL-A; LONG-TERM; PART 1; CIRCULATION; SHELF; SYSTEM; CONSEQUENCES,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,,,,,,

This is particularly true for the buccal inhabiting genus <em>Ceratothoa</em> Dana, 1852, whose members have been implicated in negatively impacting the health of both farmed and wild-caught fishes. As research on this group increases, so does our understanding of their host specificity and distribution. The aims of this paper were thus to review the current distribution and host records of <em>Ceratothoa</em> and describe a new species, <em>Ceratothoa springbok</em> n. sp. from South Africa. Including the new species described here, there are currently 25 accepted <em>Ceratothoa</em> spp. known from eight of the 12 marine biogeographical realms of the world. The majority of Cymothoidae species are known to occur in the tropical realms, whereas our analyses show that the greatest diversity of <em>Ceratothoa</em> spp. can be found in temperate realms. These results indicate the possibility that <em>Ceratothoa</em> is more diverse in temperate regions. This review also highlights the low diversity of <em>Ceratothoa</em> from the oceans around both North and South America. Current records indicate that species of <em>Ceratothoa</em> parasitise 108 fish species in 76 genera and 41 families. Eleven <em>Ceratothoa</em> spp. demonstrate host specificity up to host genus or family level. Amongst the hosts, members of the Sparidae are parasitised by 13 species of <em>Ceratothoa</em>, making it the host family with the highest diversity of parasites from this genus. The new species, <em>C. springbok</em> n. sp., also parasitises a sparid and was found in the buccal cavity of the carpenter seabream, <em>Argyrozona argyrozona</em>. This new species, the largest of all recorded <em>Ceratothoa</em> (up to 65&nbsp;mm) and amongst the largest of all Cymothoidae, is characterised by its truncate and ventrally folded frontal margin, pereonite 1 with medial indentations, the wide anterolateral margins of pereonite 1 with an inwardly produced point, and a well-developed carina on the basis of pereopod 7.

The deep Mediterranean, however, has a low diversity of isopods related to its oligotrophy, the thermal stability of deep-water masses (~12.8 °C below 150–200 m) and rather homogeneous geomorphology. The main factor defining isopod habitats in the Balearic Basin is insularity vs mainland influence. Desmosomatidae and Ischnomesidae, examples of epibenthic species (with lack of paddle-shaped legs and non/low-natatory capacity) are mainly linked to mainland areas with higher % organic matter (OM) and labile C, indicating food availability. By contrast, suprabenthic species like Munnopsidae (with some paddle-shaped, natatory, legs) are more dominant in insular areas. Compared with the Atlantic, the degree of impoverishment in diversity (number of species, S) of deep-Mediterranean asellotes is higher among epibenthos (with a lot of families/genera absent in the deep Mediterranean) than for suprabenthic species, with potential natatory capacity (natatory legs). This suggests that the high diversity of deep sea asellotes may depend on the trophic niches (sediment richness and diversity of habitats) available. In the 20 yrs period (1991–2011) of our (non-continuous) sampling series we identified some climatic influence (higher ENSO index) on the high densities reported in 1991–1992 samples, related to species taken at submarine canyons in mainland areas. Higher food availability (by advection) in canyons during 1991 and 1992 related with an increase of rainfall regime may enhance recruitment (e.g. in March 1992 inside canyons) and abundance/diversity of asellotes, especially for epibenthic species (Desmosomatidae).","Cartes, J.E.; Figueroa, D.F.",WOS:000582696800002,"Figueroa, Diego, D.F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102415,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Mediterranean; Diversity; Deep sea; Submarine canyons; Asellote isopods; Suprabenthos,Journal article,,,"ICM CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, P Maritim de La Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",Spain,Mediterranean; Diversity; Deep sea; Submarine canyons; Asellote isopods; Suprabenthos,CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; BENTHIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; ORGANIC-MATTER; BATHYMETRIC DISTRIBUTION; CRUSTACEAN COMMUNITIES; PERACARID CRUSTACEANS; SUBMARINE CANYONS; SOUTHERN MARGIN; ABYSSAL-PLAIN; WATER,Oceanography,Oceanography,CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

While the cost of broad-scale monitoring by professionals may be prohibitive, citizen science (also referred to as community science) will likely play an important role in understanding biodiversity responses to urbanization into the future. Here, we present a framework that relies on broad-scale citizen science data –– collected through iNaturalist –– to quantify (1) species-specific responses to urbanization on a continuous scale, capitalizing on globally-available VIIRS night-time lights data; and (2) community-level measures of the urbanness of a given biological community that can be aggregated to any spatial unit relevant for policy-decisions. We demonstrate the potential utility of this framework in the Boston metropolitan region, using >1000 species aggregated across 87 towns throughout the region. Of the most common species, our species-specific urbanness measures highlighted the expected difference between native and non-native species. Further, our biological community-level urbanness measures –– aggregated by towns –– negatively correlated with enhanced vegetation indices within a town and positively correlated with the area of impervious surface within a town. We conclude by demonstrating how towns can be ‘ranked’ promoting a framework where towns can be compared based on whether they over- or under-perform in the urbanness of their community relative to other towns. Ultimately, biodiversity conservation in urban environments will best succeed with robust, repeatable, and interpretable measures of biodiversity responses to urbanization, and involving the broader public in the derivation and tracking of these responses will likely result in increased bioliteracy and conservation awareness.","Callaghan, C.T.; Ozeroff, I.; Hitchcock, C.; Chandler, M.",WOS:000587339000005,"Callaghan, Corey, C.T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108753,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Citizen science; Community science; Participatory science; Community-based monitoring; Urban ecology; Urban tolerance; Sampling biases; iNaturalist, species occurrence data",Journal article,,,"UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Australia,"Citizen science; Community science; Participatory science; Community-based monitoring; Urban ecology; Urban tolerance; Sampling biases; iNaturalist, species occurrence data",CONSERVATION SCIENCE; DATA QUALITY; URBANIZATION; POPULATION; EXTINCTION; LANDSCAPE; KNOWLEDGE; BIASES; BIRDS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Sydney,x,Australia,,University,Science

Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU): Trondheim. 45 pp.","Alien species, together with climate change, habitat loss to land and sea use, overexploitation and pollution are the major threats to biodiversity globally. In the marine environment, species are spread through different pathways, international shipping and aquaculture being some of these. One important step in managing alien species is to monitor areas susceptible to receive alien species for early detection. Such areas are, among others, commercial harbors that receive international shipping and marinas where recreational crafts may contribute to secondary spread of species. In this study, the occurrence of 21 alien marine invertebrates were investigated in 22 harbors and marinas along the coast between Trondheim and Oslo. International harbors along the coast between Trondheim and Oslo were surveyed following sampling procedures from the HELCOM/OSPAR sampling protocol. Marinas for recreational crafts in the same area were sampled with a Rapid Coastal Survey approach. Alien species were found in all surveyed sites. More alien species was found in the southern part of the study area than further north. Four species, the amphipod Caprella mutica, the cirriped Amphibalanus improvisus, the bivalve Crassostrea gigas and the ascidian Styela clava, were recorded. All the species found are already known to be established in Norwegian waters, no doorknockers, species that are established in neighboring countries or expected to establish in Norway within 50 years, were found. Correct species identification is crucial for monitoring of alien species. Tools to aid precise identification are provided for the four species found in this study, with special regard to distinguishing the alien species from native congruences. Identification sheets for these species are provided. An identification key for commonly found caprellids in Norwegian waters was developed.","Espelien, M.S.",,"Espelien, Marte Svorkmo, M.S.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

The macromolluscan (here defined as adult molluscs &gt;10 mm) diversity of this large marine realm has been the subject of numerous surveys over the last 50 years. However, the smaller molluscs (here defined as adult molluscs &lt;10 mm) have, for the most part, been ignored due to challenges in the collection and study of this assemblage. To begin to redress this imbalance a pilot project specifically designed to target smaller molluscs was undertaken over the final three years (2012–2014) of the survey component of the <em>Woodside Collection Project (Kimberley) 2009–2014</em>. Seventy-seven stations (of 179 surveyed) were sampled yielding 1,883 identified specimen lots representing 505 micromollusc species from ≤5 mm adult size class (following Geiger et al. 2007), 43 species from&nbsp;&gt;5–10 mm adult size class, 68 species from &gt;10 mm adult size class, which are likely to be juveniles of macromolluscs, as well as 8 species whose adult size could not be determined. This diversity spans 102 family or superfamily level taxa. Twenty-one of these familial level taxa were new to the survey area (see Bryce et al. 2018 for a full description of the Kimberley survey area) and the number of taxa recorded from a further 18 families was doubled. A considerable degree of species rarity characterised this fauna with almost 52% of all species being singletons. Less than 22% of taxa were recorded from three or more stations. A total of at least 26 new species, not yet formally described, as well as an additional 23 new records, for the survey area and/or Australia were discovered, yielding 49 new species-level records. Two formal taxonomic revisions are undertaken in this paper due to the acquisition of new material and a review of type material. Firstly, <em>Haplocochlias minutissumus</em> Pilsbry, 1921 is synonymised under <em>Liotina parvissima</em> Hedley, 1899 [as <em>Lophocochlias parvissimus</em> (Hedley, 1899)]. Secondly, the synonymy of <em>Condylocuna io</em> (Bernard, 1915) and <em>Condylocuna tricosa</em> Middelfart, 2002, is revoked.

The abundance and distribution of fin whales in the Chukchi Sea varies from year-to-year, possibly reflecting fluctuating environmental conditions. We hypothesized that fin whale calls were most likely to be detected in years and at sites where productive water masses were present, indicated by low temperatures and high salinities, and where strong northward water and wind velocities, resulting in increased prey advection, were prevalent. Using acoustic recordings from three moored hydrophones in the Bering Strait region from 2009–2015, we identified fin whale calls during the open-water season (July–November) and investigated potential environmental drivers of interannual variability in fin whale presence. We examined near-surface and near-bottom temperatures (T) and salinities (S), wind and water velocities through the strait, water mass presence as estimated using published T/S boundaries, and satellite-derived sea surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations. Our results show significant interannual variability in the acoustic presence of fin whales with the greatest detections of calls in years with contrasting environmental conditions (2012 and 2015). Colder temperatures, lower salinities, slower water velocities, and weak southward winds prevailed in 2012 while warmer temperatures, higher salinities, faster water velocities, and moderate southward winds prevailed in 2015. Most detections (96%) were recorded at the mooring site nearest the confluence of the nutrient-rich Anadyr and Bering Shelf water masses, ~35&nbsp;km north of Bering Strait, indicating that productive water masses may influence the occurrence of fin whales. The disparity in environmental conditions between 2012 and 2015 suggests there may be multiple combinations of environmental factors or other unexamined variables that draw fin whales into the Pacific Arctic.","Escajeda, E.; Stafford, K.M.; Woodgate, R.A.; Laidre, K.L.",WOS:000571475200007,"Escajeda, Erica, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2020.104782,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Arctic; Bioacoustics; Fin whales; Chukchi Sea; Bering Strait; Interannual variability; Environmental factors; Marine ecology; Marine mammals,Journal article,,,"Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",USA,Arctic; Bioacoustics; Fin whales; Chukchi Sea; Bering Strait; Interannual variability; Environmental factors; Marine ecology; Marine mammals,ZOOPLANKTON; PATTERNS; TRENDS; ALASKA; SHELF; WATER; BAY; MOVEMENTS; CETACEANS; MIGRATION,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Washington,,USA,,University,Science

In Spain, the common name “<em>zamburiña</em>”, which officially only refers to the species <em>Mimachlamys varia</em> (the variegated scallop), is frequently mistakenly used to refer to other pectinid species, and this confuses consumers. In this study, we carried out the first assessment of the levels of fraud in samples from 12 supermarkets/small shops offering fresh, frozen, or canned pectinid products and in 20 restaurants offering “<em>zamburiñas</em>” in Asturias (northern Spain). Taxonomic and genetic identifications of the involved species (using 16S mitochondrial rRNA partial fragments) were conducted. Our results showed that 73 (49%) out of the 148 analyzed samples from the fifteen commercial products under study (4 fresh, 6 frozen and 5 canned products) were mislabeled (a global 60% of commercial products had substitutions). Moreover, the analysis of the dishes that were commercially labeled with the vernacular name “<em>zamburiñas</em>” from 20 restaurants sampled across the region revealed that in all of them (100%), the species detected was the Peruvian scallop (<em>Argopecten purpuratus</em>), known in Spanish as “<em>vieira del Pacífico”</em>. These results imply intentional deceit and therefore violations of consumer rights.

We found evidence of the spatially heterogeneous oceanographic conditions of the EEZ of Cuba, since the analysed variables fluctuated spatially with meridional and zonal gradients. Overall, the southern sectors were warmer and less productive than the northern ones, thereby showing the influence of the Caribbean Sea. The NWS showed the highest variability of the physical and biological variables analysed, given the convergence of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico waters and the Loop Current variability. The NES was strongly influenced by coastal conditions given its limited area and long coast line. Besides, a significant decadal increase in SSHA was linked to that in SST. Still, this warming trend was not reflected in the chl-a concentration and NPP trends, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no change over the studied 20 years in mean wind regime and MLD. Furthermore, the strong El Niño Southern Oscillation events of 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 appear to have considerably impacted the surface chl-a concentration, which was partially governed by the variability of the MLD.","Avila-Alonso, D.; Baetens, J.M.; Cardenas, R.; De Baets, B.",WOS:000582806700001,"Baetens, Jan, J.M.","KERMIT, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2020.103416,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba; Oceanographic conditions; Remote sensing; Trends,Journal article,,,"Univ Cent Marta Abreu de Las Villas, Dept Phys, Planetary Sci Lab, Santa Clara 54830, Cuba.",Cuba,Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba; Oceanographic conditions; Remote sensing; Trends,GULF-OF-MEXICO; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION; PANULIRUS-ARGUS LATREILLE; WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA; KENDALL TREND TEST; LOW-LEVEL JET; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOOP CURRENT; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography",Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling - BIOMATH,x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

However, most of this knowledge is derived from studies on nearshore and shallow-water reefs, with coral reef ecosystems remaining virtually unstudied in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), commonly known as the high seas. We reviewed information on the spatial distribution of reef-building corals throughout their depth range, and compiled a total of 537,782 records, including 116 unique records from ABNJ at depths between 218–5,647 m. The majority of reef-building coral records in ABNJ were in association with geomorphological features that have steep topographies. These habitats, which include escarpments, seamounts, and submarine ridges accounted for >74% of the records in international waters. Such geomorphological features, particularly those that occur within close proximity to the sea surface, should be prioritized for future scientific exploration. The majority of the reef-building coral records in ABNJ (>77%) were recorded in unprotected waters, and this study discusses the challenges and opportunities for protecting marine biodiversity in ABNJ.

The pteriomorphian bivalves (e.g., oysters, scallops, and ark clams), with a remarkable range of photoreceptor organs and ecologies, are a suitable system to investigate the association between eye evolution and ecological shifts. The present phylogenetic framework was based on amino acid sequences from transcriptome datasets and nucleotide sequences of five additional genes. In total, 197 species comprising 22 families from all five pteriomorphian orders were examined, representing the greatest taxonomic sampling to date. Morphological data were acquired for 162 species and lifestyles were compiled from the literature for all 197 species. Photoreceptor organs occur in 11 families and have arisen exclusively in epifaunal lineages, that is, living above the substrate, at least five times independently. Models for trait evolution consistently recovered higher rates of loss over gain. Transitions to crevice‐dwelling habit appear associated with convergent gains of eyespots in epifaunal lineages. Once photoreceptor organs have arisen, multiple losses occurred in lineages that shift to burrowing lifestyles and deep‐sea habitats. The observed patterns suggest that eye evolution in pteriomorphians might have evolved in association with light‐guided behaviors, such as phototaxis, body posture, and alarm responses.","Audino, J.A.; Serb, J.M.; Marian, J.E.A.R.",WOS:000560258800001,"Marian, José Eduardo, J.E.A.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/evo.14050,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Zool, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",Brazil,Ancestral state estimation; eye; macroevolution; mollusk; morphology; phylogeny,CONCAVE MIRROR EYES; FUNCTIONAL-MORPHOLOGY; SPATIAL VISION; PALLIAL EYES; ARK CLAMS; SCALLOPS; MOLLUSCA; LIMA; BIOLOGY; HISTORY,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,University of São Paulo (USP) - Institute of Bioscience,x,,,,

We searched to find fungal indicator species for a certain forest type and which are the main drivers and their effects on the composition of the lignicolous macrofungal assemblages.

Relationships between fungal composition of plots and environmental variables were performed using detrended and canonical correspondence analyses.<br><strong>Key results</strong> – A total of 377 fungal taxa in approximately 4600 records (in 59 plots) were identified. Six distinct clusters of lignicolous fungal assemblages were defined and separated three groups: 1) species-rich lignicolous fungal assemblages in beech forests (1 cluster), 2) well defined fungal assemblages in the mixed broadleaved-coniferous forests (2 clusters), and 3) fungal assemblages typical to oak forests (3 clusters). Ordination methods highlighted the forest type as the most important factor influencing the fungal composition of plots. Forestry Aridity Index, tree diversity and large trees basal area were also important factors for fungal assemblages but with a lower contribution. <br><strong>Conclusion</strong> – In the studied region, fungal assemblages changed from oak to beech and to mixed, broadleaved-coniferous forests mainly as a consequence of different tree composition.

Prior to their migration, eels develop a silver coloration being referred to as “silver eels.” Due to the dramatic European eel recruitment decline, it is crucial to quantify silver eel escapement to evaluate the success of measures taken under Eel Management Plans (Regulation EC (1100/2007)). Thus, the percentage of silver eels escaping from the River Mondego (Portugal) was estimated during two consecutive spawning seasons (2014–2016) and their migratory behaviour was studied. Thirty‐six male silver eels were tagged with acoustic transmitters and their downstream migration was tracked using automatic receivers deployed at four locations along the river course, from the first impassable obstacle up to the river mouth (67 km). Among the tagged eels, 15 (42%) escaped to the sea. In both years, individuals displayed faster migration speed in the downstream reaches of the river. BRT (“Boosted Regression Trees”) models were used to explain downstream migration and escapement of silver eels. The analyses revealed that the downstream migration is triggered by several environmental variables with water conductivity as the most influential predictor. Escapement of eels from the estuary occurred a few hours after their arrival and was primarily explained by the offshore wind intensity, which promotes a current in the coast that may favour their transport to the open sea. These findings contribute to a better understanding of silver eel migration in southern latitudes and highlight and reinforce the need to monitor spawner escapement.","Monteiro, R.M.; Domingos, I.; Almeida, P.R.; Costa, J.L.; Alexandre, C.M.; Quintella, B.R.",WOS:000523693600001,"Monteiro, Rui Miguel, R.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/eff.12545,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",Mondego R.,,Acoustic telemetry,,"environmental variables, migration speed, spawning migration",Journal article,,,"Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE Ctr Ciencias Mar & Ambiente, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",Portugal,acoustic telemetry; environmental variables; migration speed; Mondego river; Portugal; spawning migration,LATE FRESH-WATER; DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; SEAWARD MIGRATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; TAGUS ESTUARY; L.; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; MODEL,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Lisbon,,Portugal,,University,Science

The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the “missing link” in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physician’s consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases. Against this background, it reviews the different measures taken to control, eradicate and prevent the emergence of animal diseases in a globalised world.","De Sadeleer, N.; Godfroid, J.",WOS:000535933100004,"Godfroid, Jacques, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/err.2020.45,,Lifewatch acknowledged,,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ St Louis, Brussels, Belgium.",Belgium,,MOUTH-DISEASE; TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK; AFRICA; EUROPE; VIRUS,Law,Government & Law,UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels,,Belgium,,University,Science

Among these causes are man‐made structures blocking their freshwater migration routes. Shipping canals with navigation locks play a dual role in this. These canals can serve as an important migration route, offering a short cut between freshwater and the sea. In contrast, the navigation locks may act as barriers to migration, causing delays and migration failures. To better understand these issues for downstream migrating fish, we studied the behaviour of European eels (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) in the Albert Canal at two scales. The mid‐scale contained a 27‐km canal pound confined by two navigation lock complexes, in which we released and tracked 86 silver eels. The small scale was a 200 × 150 m area just in front of the most downstream complex of the canal pound, where we analysed the behaviour of 33 eels in relation to the flow field resulting from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. This paper discusses the factors influencing fish behaviour, and the relation between these behaviours on both scales. On the mid‐scale, migration efficiency resulted from a combination of intrinsic behaviour and flow in the canal pound. Also on the small scale, intrinsic behaviour influenced the success to pass the navigation lock. Increasing the flow would create more attraction and passage opportunities and hence facilitate migration through shipping canals, but only if this flow guides the fish through safe passage routes.","Vergeynst, J.; Pauwels, I.; Baeyens, R.; Mouton, A.; De Mulder, T.; Nopens, I.",WOS:000550449500001,"Vergeynst, Jenna, J.","BIOMATH—Model-Based Analysis and Optimisation of Bioprocesses, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Universiteit Gent",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/eff.12565,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,Computational fluid dynamics,,"downstream fish migration, European eel, fish behaviour, navigation locks, shipping canal",Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, BIOMATH Model Based Anal & Optimisat Bioproc, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,computational fluid dynamics; downstream fish migration; European eel; fish behaviour; navigation locks; shipping canal,SILVER EELS; FISH; L.,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling - BIOMATH,x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Imaging systems are used more and more frequently in the marine domain to generate huge amounts of imagery data. For example, automatic image classification is used to determine the abundance, size and biomass of plankton communities. In addition, the recent advances of imaging sensors and the growing datasets, highlight the importance of the management and storage capacity of these data. Thus, establishing data standards, optimized data flows and quality control procedures will promote the ability to make these datasets findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR principles).At the moment, there are a number of online open-access databases that collect marine biodiversity data, such as the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), and more specialized in plankton observations such as the COPEPOD for plankton biomass and ECOTAXA for taxonomic annotation of plankton images. However, they currently lack relevant standards to link metadata of the images.International biodiversity data standards, such as Darwin Core (DwC), are already widely used in OBIS and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). OBIS, has recently adopted the OBIS-ENV-DATA, a format that follows the DwC-Archive (DwC-A) standard, consisting of a DwC Event table in combination with an Occurrence an extended Measurement or Fact table. This structure enables the linkage of quantitative and qualitative properties to both sampling events and species occurrences. It also includes additional fields for property standardization, such as the BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) controlled vocabularies, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), which provides crucial quality control support for taxonomic data, and Marine Regions, a database that provides standardized marine georeferenced place names and areas. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to include imagery metadata and derived data in OBIS-ENV-DATA.During this TDWG 2020 symposium, we would like to present and discuss our ongoing work to establish best practices and standardized protocols for imaging data and metadata acquired by a large spectrum of bio-optic sensors. Furthermore, we highlight how the integration of the metadata will flow to existing biodiversity data portals, the European EMODnet Biology portal, (EurOBIS) and OBIS.","Martin-Cabrera, P.; Lombard, F.; Irisson, J.-O.; Stemmann, L.; Möller, K.O.; Lindh, M.; Creach, V.; Schepers, L.",,"Irisson, Jean-Olivier, J.-O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.4.58932,,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"imagery data, data standardization, Darwin Core Archive, species occurrence, plankton",Journal article,Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is necessary to develop easily reproducible methods to identify and prioritize actions to maintain or restore ecological corridors. To date, several competing methods are used with recurrent debate on which is best and if expert-based approaches can replace data-driven models. We compared three methods: knowledge-driven (expert based), data-driven (based on species distribution model), and a mixed approach. We quantified their differences in habitat and corridor mapping, and prioritizations of landscape elements in terms of importance for connectivity. Key parameters generating these differences were identified. To put this into practice, the case study of the wildcat (<em>Felis silvestris</em> Schreber, 1777) was chosen. The results highlighted differences and similarities between approaches used. The data-driven approach was more successful in identifying the suitable habitat with regard to wildcat ecology, while the knowledge-driven approach was better able to account for obstacles to wildcat movements in the landscape matrix. However, these two methods converged for the identification of patterns of habitat patches and corridors that are important for global landscape connectivity. For both methods, we identified adjustments that can improve the outcome. The mixed approach largely differed in that it required more inputs to be performed. In the end, conservation actions were identified and could guide nature conservation practitioners in their efforts to restore landscape connectivity.","Bourdouxhe, A.; Duflot, R.; Radoux, J.; Dufrêne, M.",WOS:000599511800007,"Radoux, Julien, J.","Earth and Life Institute, Université catholique de Louvain",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125901,,Lifewatch acknowledged,,,,,"ecological network, habitat suitability model, least cost path",Journal article,,,"Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, 2 Passage Deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",Belgium,Ecological network; Habitat suitability model; Least cost path,FELIS-SILVESTRIS; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; DOMINATED LANDSCAPE; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; DOMESTIC CATS; LEAST-COST; FOREST; GRAPH; HYBRIDIZATION; AVAILABILITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Catholique University of Louvain - Earth and Life Institute (ELI),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Different from a previous study, we found that background masking slightly improved performance. In general, training only a classifier on top of convolutional layers pre-trained on extensive, but not domain-specific image data showed surprisingly high performance (F1 scores around 97%) with already relatively few (100–300) examples per class, indicating that domain adaptation to a novel taxonomic group can be feasible with a limited investment of effort.","Kloster, M.; Langenkämper, D.; Zurowietz, M.; Beszteri, B.; Nattkemper, T.W.",WOS:000608581100001,"Kloster, Michael, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-71165-w,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Bielefeld Univ, Fac Technol, Biodata Min Grp, Bielefeld, Germany.",Germany,,OCEAN; CLASSIFICATION; CARBON,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Bielefeld University,,Germany,,University,Science

The extent to which dynamic (within-season) changes in anthropogenic landscapes affects these interactions is poorly understood. Lesser black-backed gulls (<em>Larus fuscus</em>) are prominent biovectors of biological and artificial materials, and have exhibited large population increases in parts of southern Europe in recent decades. </p><p><strong>Methods: </strong>We combined GPS tracking, earth observation, accelerometry and field observations to study the space use of overwintering in a mixed rice field landscape in Andalusia, Southern Spain. We used Manly selectivity metrics and classified remote sensing imagery to directly evaluate space use and habitat selection for these gulls and how it changed throughout the rice harvest cycle. </p><p><strong>Results: </strong>Analysis of over 45,000 GPS fixes and 14 classified remotely-sensed images from winter 2016-17 showed dynamic space use driven by the harvest-related flooding across the rice harvest cycle. Prior to harvest, gulls foraged in rice paddies during the day and roosted in adjacent waterbodies (the River Guadalquivir, and fish ponds) at night. During harvest, they spent nearly 100% of their daily cycle within the rice fields, foraging in harvested paddies and roosting in post-harvest, flooded paddies. After harvest, they roosted in flooded fields at night and foraged at landfills in the surrounding landscape. </p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Gull space use at landscape and paddy scales was closely linked to dynamic land and water management over the rice agricultural cycle, illustrating the detailed scales at which human activities influence the movements of ecologically important, human-associated biovectors like gulls.

The following hypotheses were tested: (1) the distribution of sea anemones (Actiniaria and Corallimorpharia) corroborates SWA biogeographic provinces, (2) their distribution presents a richness peak at mid-latitudes, and (3) temperature is the main abiotic driver that structures their species composition. Occurrences/registries were obtained mainly from published sources. We adopted Sørensen dissimilarity and cluster analyses to compare fauna compositions. To verify latitudinal richness patterns, we used a Hill’s numbers approach through rarefaction and extrapolation techniques. Partial redundancy analysis was performed to identify which drivers contribute more to the distribution. The sea anemone faunas are congruent with the following SWA provinces: Brazilian province (BP, 0 to 33° S), Argentinian province (36 to 43° S), and Patagonian province (43 to 56° S), and all differ from the Caribbean province (CP). Although there is a high similarity among the BP and the CP, they form significant clusters with well-supported endemism levels (> 19%). An elevated richness was found at 19–23° S, in the BP southeast (34 spp. and 13% of endemism), supporting an SWA biodiversity center. Temperature explained 64% of the distribution, and the Amazonas-Orinoco and La Plata estuaries act as soft barriers. The sea anemone distribution can be explained by features of the local current systems, combined with isolation through barriers and different ecological tolerances. Furthermore, the patterns reported herein (unprecedented for the group) are similar to those of other marine taxa. A transition zone between tropical and subtropical waters indicates diversity and species accumulation in the SWA.","Targino, A.K.G.; Gomes, P.B.",WOS:000570927400002,"Targino, Alessandra, A.K.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-020-01099-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Dom Manoel Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil.",Brazil,Biogeography; Endemism; Brazil; Caribbean; Actiniaria; Corallimorpharia,TROPICAL REEF FISHES; SPECIES-RICHNESS; CORAL-REEF; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; CNIDARIA ANTHOZOA; GLOBAL PATTERNS; BODY-SIZE; MARINE; ACTINIARIA; DIVERSITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE),,Brazil,,University,Science

The critical role played by the country’s ports on economic development has come at the cost of compromising the ecological health of the environment. The present study was to assess the status of biofouling assemblages in coastal waters impacted by the Port of Colombo. Sampling was conducted from February to December 2018 in the Dikkowita Fisheries Harbour, Kirulapone canal opening, and Panadura Fisheries Harbour. The fouling assemblages in the rocky intertidal zone were studied using photo-quadrats and environmental surveys. Photo-quadrats were obtained monthly following a protocol developed by the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom and modified to suit the local environments, whilst area surveys were conducted at two-month intervals. In addition, artificial settlement structures were deployed to assess subtidal fouling communities. Species abundance was estimated by individual counts, and percentage cover was determined using CPCe software. A total of 47 macrofouling taxa were recorded. High numbers were recorded from the phyla Mollusca (20), Arthropoda (06), and Porifera (4). <em>Saccostrea cuccullata</em> (Bivalvia), <em>Cellana radiata</em> (Gastropoda), <em>Clypidina notata</em> (Gastropoda), and <em>Balanus reticulatus</em> (Crustacea) were some of the common species found in all three study sites.

Area-based conservation efforts, which include both protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, are likely to extend and diversify. However, persistent shortfalls in ecological representation and management effectiveness diminish the potential role of area-based conservation in stemming biodiversity loss. Here we show how the expansion of protected areas by national governments since 2010 has had limited success in increasing the coverage across different elements of biodiversity (ecoregions, 12,056 threatened species, ‘Key Biodiversity Areas’ and wilderness areas) and ecosystem services (productive fisheries, and carbon services on land and sea). To be more successful after 2020, area-based conservation must contribute more effectively to meeting global biodiversity goals—ranging from preventing extinctions to retaining the most-intact ecosystems—and must better collaborate with the many Indigenous peoples, community groups and private initiatives that are central to the successful conservation of biodiversity. The long-term success of area-based conservation requires parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to secure adequate financing, plan for climate change and make biodiversity conservation a far stronger part of land, water and sea management policies.","Maxwell, S.L.; Cazalis, V.; Dudley, N.; Hoffmann, M.; Rodrigues, A.S.L.; Stolton, S.; Visconti, P.; Woodley, S.; Kingston, N.; Lewis, E.; Maron, M.; Strassburg, B.B.N.; Wenger, A.; Jonas, H.D.; Venter, O.; Watson, J.E.M.",WOS:000576034100014,"Maxwell, Sean, S.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41586-020-2773-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",Australia,,MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; TARGET 11; OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; RESERVES; EXPORT; LAND,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Queensland - School of Earth and Environment Sciences,,Australia,,University,Science

Here, we demonstrate that the description of the genus <em>Magallana</em> fulfils the norms of taxonomic and indexing revisions, and is well-founded on a scientific basis. The clade named <em>Magallana</em> is supported by a robust phylogeny based on comprehensive taxon sampling, independent datasets and varied analytical methods. A new maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of oysters, based on mitochondrial gene order data (representing molecular phenotypes above the sequence level), has provided additional support for this classification. These results are fully consistent with all previously published phylogenetic studies, thus providing an unambiguous indication of the stability of the clade that meets all the currently accepted criteria for naming clades as taxa. We show that, while the criterion of ‘morphological diagnosability’ is not applicable at any level of oyster classification, several striking molecular phenotypes are diagnostic of <em>Magallana</em>, both at the nuclear and the mitochondrial genome level. The classification with three genera <em>Magallana</em>, <em>Crassostrea</em> and <em>Talonostrea</em> reflects the evolutionary diversity of Crassostreinae and is consistent with taxonomic ranking criteria adopted for other oyster subfamilies.","Salvi, D.; Mariottini, P.",WOS:000651842400003,"Mariottini, Paolo, P.","Univ Roma Tre, Dept Sci, Viale G Marconi 446, I-00146 Rome, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaa112,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Crassostreinae, ""Ostreidae""","Aquaculture, ""Nomenclature"", ""Shellfish"", ""Taxonomy""",,"cryptic taxa, name stability",Journal article,,,"Univ Aquila, Dept Hlth Life & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio, I-67100 Coppito, Italy.",Italy,aquaculture; Crassostreinae; cryptic taxa; nomenclature; name stability; Ostreidae; shellfish; taxonomy,COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; CRYPTIC SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MORPHOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION; BIVALVIA OSTREIDAE; SACCOSTREA-CUCULLATA; CUPPED OYSTER; DNA SEQUENCE; CLASSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION,Zoology,Zoology,University of Roma Tre,,Italy,,University,Science

Manual creation of such names remains difficult and slow and typically relies on expert-driven nomenclatural quality control. Keen to ensure the legacy of Linnaeus lives on in the age of microbial genomics and metagenomics, we propose an automated approach, employing combinatorial concatenation of roots from Latin and Greek to create linguistically correct names for genera and species that can be used off the shelf as needed.

This transparent, flexible and on-line available positioning algorithm overcomes problems related to traditional point-by-point positioning and filtering techniques.

The positioning accuracy of YAPS increases with decreasing burst intervals, especially when the number of observations is low, when reflectivity is high or when information out-of-array is used. However, when the burst interval is stable, large burst intervals (in the order of 1 to 2 min) can be chosen without strongly hampering the accuracy (although this results in information loss).

Phytoplankton samples were collected bimonthly from June 2010 to April 2011, to cover both dry (June to October) and wet (November to April) seasons, at four selected sampling sites along the river. Diatoms showed the highest number of species (50 species) from a total of 85 phytoplankton species from 76 genera. Diatoms contributed more than 90% of the total phytoplankton abundance during the dry season (southwest monsoon) and less than 70% during the wet season (northeast monsoon) as dinoflagellates became more abundant during the rainy season. Two diatoms were recorded as dominant species throughout the sampling period; <i>Cyclotella</i> sp. and <i>Skeletonema costatum</i>. <i>Cyclotella</i> sp. formed the most abundant species (62% of total phytoplankton) during the dry period characterized by low nutrients and relatively low turbidity. <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> contributed 93% of the total phytoplankton in October, which marked the end of the dry season and the beginning of the wet season, characterized by strong winds and high waves leading to the upwelling of the water column. Massive blooms of <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> occurred during the upwelling when total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were highest (<span class=""html-italic"">p</span> &lt; 0.05) throughout the year. The abundance of diatom species during the wet season was more evenly distributed, with most diatom species contributing less than 12% of the total phytoplankton.

Assemblage metrics of conservation relevance—faunal abundance and its patchiness, faunal richness, and beta diversity—were examined at four contrasting dwarf-eelgrass localities in the Knysna estuarine bay, part of South Africa's Garden Route National Park but a system whose intertidal areas are heavily impacted anthropogenically. Faunal assemblages were significantly different across all localities and between subtidal and intertidal levels at each locality although their taxonomic distinctness was effectively constant. Although, as would be expected, there were clear trends for increases in overall numbers of species towards the mouth at all levels, few generalities relating to the relative importance of the subtidal seagrass habitat were evident across the whole system—magnitude and direction of differentials were contingent on locality. Shore-height related differences in assemblage metrics were minor in the estuarine and lagoonal zones but major in the marine compartment, although the much greater subtidal faunal abundance there was largely consequent on the superabundance of a single species (the microgastropod Alaba pinnae), intertidal zones then displaying the greater species diversity due to greater equitability of species densities. Along its axial channel, the Knysna subtidal seagrass does not support richer versions of the intertidal polychaete-dominated assemblages fringing it; instead, it supports different and more patchily dispersed gastropod-dominated ones. At Knysna at least, the subtidal hardly constitutes a reservoir of the seagrass biodiversity present intertidally.","Barnes, R.S.K.; Claassens, L.",WOS:000551350500001,"Claassens, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10531-020-02019-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Alaba, ""Smaragdia"", ""Zostera capensis""",Patchiness,,"Bait-harvesting, Eelgrass, Knysna, Macrofauna, Soft sediments",Journal article,,,"Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England.",England,Alaba; Bait-harvesting; Eelgrass; Knysna; Patchiness; Macrofauna; Soft sediments; Smaragdia; Zostera capensis,UPOGEBIA-AFRICANA CRUSTACEA; ZOSTERA-CAPENSIS; KNYSNA ESTUARY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; PERMANENTLY OPEN; ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; SUBSISTENCE; SEDIMENT,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Cambridge,,UK,,University,Science

The dominant oceanographic feature in this region is the Leeuwin Current, which transports warm, lower-salinity, tropical waters southward along the shelf-edge. This study examined data collected by Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System at three coastal National Reference Stations located at 22°S 114°E, 32°S 115°E and 34°S 122°E. Spatial and temporal patterns in zooplankton abundance, composition and diversity were investigated, and differences in assemblage structure, particularly with respect to copepods, were related to oceanographic conditions. Clear dissimilarities among copepod assemblages were observed, becoming weaker in winter owing to enhanced connectivity of species driven by alongshore and cross-shelf transport in the Leeuwin Current. Both physical and biogeochemical factors were significant in structuring copepod assemblages, with seawater density, incorporating temperature and salinity, exerting the greatest influence. The results suggest that both broad-scale latitudinal gradients and mesoscale events contribute to variation in zooplankton assemblages in these waters. This study provides the first detailed comparison of zooplankton assemblages among the north-west, south-west and southern coastal waters of Western Australia, and enhances understanding of the processes influencing zooplankton distribution and structure.","McCosker, E.; Davies, C.H.; Beckley, L.E.",WOS:000556426000001,"Beckley, Lynnath, L.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1071/mf19397,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Murdoch Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",Australia,mesozooplankton; oceanography,LARVAL FISH ASSEMBLAGES; CROSS-SHELF VARIABILITY; EASTERN INDIAN-OCEAN; LEEUWIN CURRENT; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; PLANKTON ECOSYSTEMS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH,Fisheries; Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Murdoch University,,Australia,,University,Science

The imagery represents a rich source of data on mammals larger than ~200 grams, providing information at the level of species and communities. Camera-trap surveys generate observations of specific mammals at a certain location and time, including photo evidence that can be evaluated by experts to map species distribution patterns. The imagery also provides information on the species composition of local communities, identifying which species co-occur and in what proportion. Moreover, the images contain information on activity patterns and other interesting aspects of animal behaviour. Because surveys can be standardized relatively easily, camera traps are well suited for documenting shifts in the behaviour, distribution and community composition, for example in response to climate and land-use change. Imagery from camera traps can thus serve as a baseline for subsequent surveys.    In less than two decades, camera traps have become the standard tool for surveying mammals. They are simple to use and non-invasive, requiring no special permits. As a consequence they are widely used by professionals and hobbyists alike. Together, tens of thousands of users have the potential to form a huge sensor network. Unfortunately however, imagery and data collected are currently rarely integrated. Rather, they are lost at a massive scale. Users tend to retain only a subset of the photos and discard the rest. Or the material ends up on an external hard disk that will at some point fail or be erased as these scientific data tend to be used within the scope of specific projects. Very few of the wealth of material becomes available for scientific research and monitoring. Moreover, joint projects are rare and there is little coordination between camera-trap users.    A solution to this problem is provided by Agouti, a platform for the organization, processing and storage of camera-trap imagery (www.agouti.eu). The aim of Agouti is, on the one hand, to standardize and facilitate collaborative camera-trap surveys, and on the other hand to compile and secure imagery and data for scientific research and monitoring, by encouraging users to share their material. Agouti provides an interface that allows users to collaborate on projects, organize and manage their surveys, upload and store imagery, and annotate images with species identifications and characteristics. Images can also be annotated through basic image recognition and crowd sourcing via a connection with the citizen science platform Zooniverse, which creates the potential to reach new audiences. Exporting data and imagery in the Camera Trap Metadata Standard (Forrester et al. 2016) will be supported in the near future. This will allow data to be archived outside of Agouti in research repositories such as Zenodo and by further mapping to Darwin Core to be made discoverable on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).    Agouti provides both professionals and the public with a practical solution for retaining camera-trap surveys and simultaneously engages people in contributing data to science in a standardized and organized manner, to the benefit of science and conservation.","Casaer, J.; Milotic, T.; Liefting, Y.; Desmet, P.; Jansen, P.",,"Desmet, Peter, P.",Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO),https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.3.46690,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,"camera traps, mammals, biodiversity monitoring, distribution, citizen science, open data, standardization",Journal article,,,,,,,,,INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

This session offers the opportunity to walk through some of the use cases developed so far, including a terrestrial GPS tracking and acceleration dataset from Movebank and a marine acoustic telemetry dataset from the Ocean Tracking Network using stationary as well as mobile acoustic receivers.Through these examples, we will describe the strategy and rationale for the approaches taken to the application of Darwin Core using typical animal tracking scenarios laced with some of the common complexities in bio-logging and other types of machine-based biodiversity observations.","Newman, P.; Pye, J.; Davidson, S.; Desmet, P.",,"Desmet, Peter, P.",Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO),https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.3.35887,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Journal article,Summary,,,,,,,,INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

However, analysis of weather radar data remains a specialised task that can be technically challenging. Major hurdles are the difficulty of accessing and visualising radar data on a software platform familiar to ecologists and biologists, processing the low‐level data into products that are biologically meaningful, and summarizing these results in standardized measures. To overcome these hurdles, we developed the open source R package bioRad, which provides a toolbox for accessing, visualizing and analyzing weather radar data for biological studies. It provides functionality to access low‐level radar data, process these data into meaningful biological information on animal speeds and directions at different altitudes in the atmosphere, visualize these biological extractions, and calculate further summary statistics. The package aims to standardize methods for extracting and reporting biological signals from weather radars. Here we describe a roadmap for analyzing weather radar data using bioRad. We also define weather radar equivalents for familiar measures used in the field of migration ecology, such as migration traffic rates, and recommend several good practices for reporting these measures. The bioRad package integrates with low‐level data from both the European radar network (OPERA) and the radar network of the United States (NEXRAD). bioRad aims to make weather radar studies in ecology easier and more reproducible, allowing for better inter‐comparability of studies.","Dokter, A.M.; Desmet, P.; Spaaks, J.H.; Van Hoey, S.; Veen, L.; Verlinden, L.; Nilsson, C.; Haase, G.; Leijnse, H.; Farnsworth, A.; Bouten, W.; Shamoun-Baranes, J.",WOS:000466819000002,"Spaaks, Jurriaan, J.H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.04028,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",USA,weather radar; aeroecology; vertical profile,BIRD MIGRATION; INSECTS; ORIENTATION; MOVEMENTS; PATTERNS; NETWORK,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Cornell University,x,USA,,University,Science

This situation is however gradually changing. In fact, since 2016, interest in the country has begun to grow, after the country resumed diplomatic relations with People’s Republic of China (hereafter China) and recognized the “one-China policy”. While the island state and Cabo Verde have followed different development paths in the post-colonial era, both share common features and both have the potential to perform important geopolitical regional roles in the context of the Belt and Road initiative (BRI). This paper discusses São Tomé and Príncipe’s regional engagement in the Gulf of Guinea (GG), the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), and in multi-level cooperation in light of the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries (FM) as well as bilateral cooperation. We argue that São Tomé and Príncipe is of geopolitical value to China and that the island state will serve Chinese interests in extending the BRI in the Gulf of Guinea. The microstate of São Tomé and Príncipe has the potential to transform itself to function as the “Qatar of the Gulf of Guinea”, and contribute to regional stability by providing regional services for shipping, banking, finance, high-quality education, tourism and as an engaged partner.

The high resolution multielement analyses by micro-X fluorescence scanning (μXRF) showed multiple variations over short increments. Variation in the abundance of elements with depth as well the ratios of the abundance of some elements (Fe/Ti and Zr/Rb) suggested both rapid and long-term changes in the origin of the material deposited, which, in turn, suggested changes in weather conditions. Principal Components Analysis (PCAs) mixing μXRF and Magnetic Susceptibility data allow identifying changes in geochemical redox processes between the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). The drastic changes in the different proxies (magnetic susceptibility, diatom assemblages, fresh water/marine water diatom ratios, abundance of Fe and S, and the Fe/Ti ratio) were interpreted to be the result of climate change before and after the MWP-LIA transition period, the Little Ice Age period being relatively wet.","Garnier, J.-M.; Garnier, J.; Debnath, P.; Prado, L.F.; Yokoyama, E.; Das, R.K.; Mathé, P.-E.; Islam, M.S.",WOS:000579842700005,"Garnier, J.-M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.049,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Bangladesh,,,,Lake sedimentation; Late Holocene; Multiproxy; Paleoclimate reconstitution; Medieval warm; Period little ice age transition; Bangladesh,Journal article,,,"Aix Marseille Univ, Coll France, CEREGE, INRA,IRD,CNRS, Aix En Provence, France.",France,Lake sedimentation; Late Holocene; Multiproxy; Paleoclimate reconstitution; Medieval warm; Period little ice age transition; Bangladesh,ICE-AGE; MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY; MONSOON VARIABILITY; VARVED SEDIMENTS; CLIMATE; CHINA; RECONSTRUCTION; ASIA,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,Aix-Marseille University,,France,,University,Science

Res. 36(5)</i>: 992-1004","Globally, estuaries are ecologically important, but many are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Macrozoobenthos organisms are suitable ecological indicators in estuaries because they can detect the effects of stress and pollution. Spatial and temporal composition of macrozoobenthos communities were quantified and compared within and between the three estuaries (uMvoti, Thukela, and aMatikulu estuaries) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, with different levels of human pressure in their catchments. Macrozoobenthos of each estuary was also related to its respective environmental variables. The aMatikulu estuary was selected as a reference site because of its relatively good ecological condition. Sampling dates represented low flow (August and September) and high flow (March and April) from 2014 to 2016. Macrozoobenthos abundance expressed as individuals per square meter (ind·m<sup>–2</sup>) was highest in aMatikulu estuary (39,167 ind·m<sup>–2</sup>), followed by Thukela estuary (29,299 ind·m<sup>–2</sup>) and then uMvoti estuary (10,336 ind·m<sup>–2</sup>). Within estuaries, number of taxa and abundance between years were significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and number of taxa and species diversity between estuaries were also significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Coarse and very coarse sand were the important environmental determinants in structuring the macrozoobenthos community in the uMvoti estuary, whereas turbidity and water temperature were the important determinants in structuring the macrozoobenthos community in the Thukela estuary. Very fine sand, mud, and salinity were among the most important environmental variables in structuring macrozoobenthos communities in the aMatikulu estuary. Environmental variables differed between estuaries; consequently, macrozoobenthos communities differed between these three systems. Outcomes of the present study indicated that macrozoobenthos communities respond to changes in environmental variables. Results of this study showed that different levels of human pressure in the catchments of these three estuaries could explain variation in their environmental variables. Such variation could increase differences in taxon composition and abundances between the three estuaries, although they are from the same geographical region with similar river-dominated functions.","Vezi, M.S.; Downs, C.T.; Wepener, V.; O'Brien, G.",,"Vezi, Madonna, M.S.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having people of all ages participate in measuring biodiversity where they live helps to create awareness. Recently, the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for biodiversity surveys has gained momentum. Here, we explore whether sampling eDNA and sequencing it can be used as a means of rapidly surveying urban biodiversity for educational purposes. We sampled 2 × 1 L of water from each of 15 locations in the city of Trondheim, Norway, including a variety of freshwater, marine, and brackish habitats. DNA was extracted, amplified in triplicate targeting the barcoding fragment of COI gene, and sequenced. The obtained data were analyzed on the novel mBRAVE platform, an online open‐access software and computing resource. The water samples were collected in 2 days by two people, and the laboratory analysis was completed in 5 days by one person. Overall, we detected the presence of 506 BINs identified as belonging to 435 taxa, representing at least 265 putative species. On average, only 5.4% of the taxa were shared among six replicates per site. Based on the observed diversity, three distinct clusters were detected and related to the geographic distribution of sites. There were some taxa shared between the habitats, with a substantial presence of terrestrial biota. Here we propose a new form of BioBlitz, where with noninvasive sampling effort combined with swift processing and straightforward online analyses, hundreds of species can be detected. Thus, using eDNA analysis of water is useful for rapid biodiversity surveys and valuable for educational purposes. We show that rapid eDNA surveys, combined with openly available services and software, can be used as an educational tool to raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity.","Hupało, Kamil; Majaneva, Markus; Czachur, Molly Victoria; Sire, Lucas; Marquina, Daniel; Lijtmaer, Darío A.; Ivanov, Vladislav; Leidenberger, Sonja; Čiampor, Fedor; Čiamporová‐Zaťovičová, Zuzana; Mendes, Izabela S.; Desiderato, Andrea; Topstad, Lasse; Meganck, Kenny; Hariz Z.

We find that the majority (71%) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded.

It determines their position within food webs, as well as their function within an ecosystem. For the better part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, aquatic protist communities were thought to consist mainly of producers (phytoplankton) and consumers (protozooplankton). Phytoplankton cover their energy requirements through photosynthesis (phototrophy), while protozooplankton graze on prey and organic particles (phagotrophy). However, over the past decades, it was shown that another trophic group (mixoplankton) comprise a notable part of aquatic protist communities. Mixoplankton employ a third trophic mode by combining phototrophy and phagotrophy (mixotrophy). Due to the historical dichotomy, it is not straightforward to gain adequate and correct information on the trophic mode of aquatic protists. Long hours of literature research or expert knowledge are needed to correctly assign trophic modes. Additionally, aquatic protists also have a long history of undergoing taxonomic changes which make it difficult to compare past and present literature. While WoRMS, the World Register of Marine Species, keeps track of the taxonomic changes and assigns each species a unique AphiaID that can be linked to its various historic and present taxonomic hierarchy, there is currently no machine-readable database to query aquatic protists for their trophic modes.","Schneider, L.K.; Anestis, K.; Mansour, J.; Anschütz, A.; Gypens, N.; Hansen, P.; John, U.; Klemm, K.; Martin, J.; Medic, J.; Not, F.; Stolte, W.",WOS:000587141300001,"John, Uwe, U.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.8.e56648,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Phytoplankton,,"aquatic protists, protozooplankton, mixoplankton, trophic mode, functional traits, functional biodiversity",Journal article,,,"Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.",Belgium,aquatic protists; phytoplankton; protozooplankton; mixoplankton; trophic mode; functional traits; functional biodiversity,MIXOTROPHIC PROTISTS; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; OCEAN,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,Free University of Brussels (VUB),x,Belgium,o,University,Science

The number of tools and approaches suggested to promote the selection of suitable areas - focusing mostly on the management of potential conflicting uses at sea - is rapidly increasing. However, to date, there is a lack of information regarding spatial planning according to a trait-based approach encompassing the functional and biological data of farmed species; a gap that may lead to selecting unsuitable areas for farming. To fill this gap, our study builds on a functional trait-based mechanistic approach based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory allowing to generated species and site-specific predictions of aquaculture performances and the related environmental impact. We applied this approach to a commercial species farmed in the Mediterranean Sea, namely, the European seabass (<em>Dicentrarchus labrax</em>). We used three seeding sizes (1.5, 2, 2.5&nbsp;g) to run model simulations and answer a crucial question for farm management, i.e. the selection of the best seeding size. A sensitivity analysis coupled with our simulations allowed to spatially represent the performance growth and environmental impact <em>per</em> seeding size across Mediterranean countries. The accuracy of the model's outcome was strengthened by using high-resolution satellite data over a wide area of investigation (c.a. 302,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The novel informative obtained layers combine both the modelling of aquaculture performance and related environmental impact to fill a lacking perspective within both AZAs (Allocated Zones for Aquaculture) and AZEs (Allowable Zones of Effect) concepts. Our approach allowed discriminating the best zones for European sea bass aquaculture at country level for each of the tested seeding sizes. High-resolution predictions of aquaculture performances and impact were provided for each of the nineteen Mediterranean coastal countries, zooming at Exclusive Economic Zone scale (EEZ). We highlighted pole-ward negative patterns with the best values in the Southern basin; Libya, Tunisia and Egypt in particular. Our spatial contextualization - through high resolution mapped outcomes - represents an effective and salient tool for stakeholders and policy makers, based on the translation of complex computational modelling results into easy-to-read maps. The highlighted patterns may provide scientific evidence for proactive capacity-building programmes at country level in the future.","Giacoletti, A.; Lucido, G.D.; Mangano, M.C.; Sarà, G.",WOS:000600427700006,"Lucido, G.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736081,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Mediterranean Sea,Dicentrarchus labrax,Aquaculture,,Aquaculture; Environmental sustainability; Impact; Mediterranean Sea; DEB model; Dicentrarchus labrax,Journal article,,,"Sicily Marine Ctr, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dipartimento Ecol Marina Integrata EMI, Lungomare Cristoforo Colombo Complesso Roosevelt, I-90142 Palermo, Italy.",Italy,Aquaculture; Environmental sustainability; Impact; Mediterranean Sea; DEB model; Dicentrarchus labrax,LENGTH-WEIGHT RELATIONSHIPS; GROWTH; FISHES,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli (SZN),,Italy,,Research institute,Science

In this paper, the morphological and meristic characteristics of this specimen are reported and discussed, compared with the other species of the genus Parexocoetus. Furthermore, as mapping and monitoring the distribution of invasive species is crucial to understanding their establishment and spread and then to manage the invasion process, the occurrences distribution of P. mento in the Mediterranean Sea was studied. The application of GIS-based spatial statistics allowed to identify significant clustering areas and dispersion areas of the species, summarizing the key characteristics, and underlining directional trends of distribution. GIS analysis identified two similar groups of records (1935/1966 and 1986/2017 time period), showing a change of distribution spatial pattern over time. An earlier spread direction in the Mediterranean east coast and a settled area of P. mento were found.

The efficiency level of coral transplantation is determined by many factors, including the stability of the environment's physical condition, the level of coral diversity, and the method of transplantation. The influence of the planting medium can also be a key factor in succeeding the coral transplantation process. The use of stable and natural growing media can be a solution to replace conventional growing media that have been used. Zeolite material is a medium that has many advantages such as amending the trace elemental contents of saltwater such as carbon absorbents, detoxifiers, ammonia remover, catalysts, promoting marine micro-algal growth, become a media for bacterial growth, etc. This review discusses the possibility of zeolites as the candidate media that can be used as a new medium in coral transplantation process to accelerate coral growth and maintain coral health by increasing the adaptation of corals to the effects of global climate change.","Islam , I.",,"Islam , Izzul, I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.20944/preprints202010.0631.v1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Coral Growth, Microfragmentation, Transplantation, Zeolite",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diverse assemblage of potentially toxic diatoms and dinoflagellates known elsewhere to cause syndromes of human poisoning was revealed in Kuwait's marine environment. A wide range of potentially harmful microalgae that can be associated with mortality of marine biota, including known ichthyotoxic dinoflagellates, raphidophycean and haptophyte flagellates, were observed routinely in Kuwait's waters. The chronological overview of recorded algal bloom events indicates that Kuwait's marine environment is increasingly affected by harmful algal blooms (HABs). Both toxic and high biomass blooms were associated with fish mortality in Kuwait's coastal waters. Most of algal blooms occurred during the warm periods in spring and autumn, whereas fish mortality events linked to high biomass blooms mainly during the hot summer season.

Results of multi-correlation analyses between the nematode bio-indices and the environmental variables were completely different from those of single-correlation analyses. In multi-correlation analyses, the species richness and the Margalef diversity index correlated to two variables (salinity, total organic carbon), Pielou’s evenness index and Hill indices correlated with dissolved oxygen, also the Hurlbert index correlated to total organic carbon.

Two rings of bracteal muscular lamellae occur on the siphosome of this corm, one on the upper surface of each cormidium and a second on the lower surface. Laterally each cormidium supports an upper gonodendron, a zooid meridian bearing palpons and a lower gonodendron. Cormidium one has the most mature gonodendra, and all cormidia have palpons on the zooid meridian, which become progressively mature towards the base.

Global repositories facilitate access to various classes of species-level data including biogeography, genetics and conservation status, which are in turn required to study different dimensions of diversity. Ensuring that these different data sources are interoperable is a challenge as we aim to create synthetic data products to monitor the state of the world's biodiversity. One way to approach this is to link data of different classes, and to inventory the availability of data across multiple sources. Here, we use a comprehensive list of more than 200 000 marine animal species, and quantify the availability of data on geographical occurrences, genetic sequences, conservation assessments and DNA barcodes across all phyla and broad functional groups. This reveals a very uneven picture: 44% of species are represented by no record other than their taxonomy, but some species are rich in data. Although these data-rich species are concentrated into a few taxonomic and functional groups, especially vertebrates, data are spread widely across marine animals, with members of all 32 phyla represented in at least one database.

These frameworks often have specific guidance on how the indicators should be applied and interpreted. Selection of indicators is an important process and those with strong scientific underpinnings are more likely to produce the expected outcomes. We reviewed three policy and assessment frameworks which include ABNJ regions or were developed specifically for ABNJ: (1) Oslo and Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) ecosystem assessments, (2) the frameworks adopted to implement the UN General Assembly (UNGA) sustainable fisheries resolutions for the management of bottom fisheries to prevent Significant Adverse Impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems, and (3) the Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Biodiversity and biogeography of polychaetes (Annelida): Globally and in Indonesia. Doctoral Theses. PhD Thesis. The University of Auckland: Auckland . 212 pp. <a href=""https://doi.org/2292/53395 "" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/2292/53395 </a>","This thesis presents a review of the biodiversity of polychaete worms (Annelida) and their distribution across the globe. It also provides an evaluation of polychaete biodiversity studies in Indonesia and a description of a new polychaete species collected from Ambon Island, Province of Maluku, Indonesia. I reviewed polychaete data from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), and found that 11,456 accepted polychaete species (1417 genera, 85 families) have been formally described by 835 first authors since the middle of the 18th century. A further 5200 more polychaete species are predicted to be discovered by the year 2100. The total number of polychaete species in the world by the end of the 21st century is thus anticipated to be about 16,700 species. While the number of both species and authors increased, the average number of polychaete species described per author decreased. This suggested increased difficulty in finding new polychaete species today as most conspicuous species may have been discovered. I analysed polychaete datasets from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), and my recently published checklist of Indonesian polychaete species, and identified 11 major biogeographic regions of polychaetes. They were: (1) North Atlantic & eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, (2) Australia, (3) Indonesia, (4) New Zealand, (5) the Atlantic coasts of Spain and France, (6) Antarctica and the southern coast of Argentina, (7) Central Mediterranean Sea, (8) the western coast of the USA, (9) the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean, (10) Caribbean Sea and (11) Atlantic Ocean. Further, the latitudinal species richness gradient pattern of the animals was found to be asymmetrically bimodal, with similar peaks of richness in the northern (60oN) and southern (30oS) hemispheres, and a pronounced dip north of the Equator (15oN). The pattern is unlikely to be due to sampling bias, but rather a natural phenomenon most significantly correlated with sea temperature. I garnered all Indonesian polychaete species names from taxonomic and ecological literature, as well as from GBIF and OBIS, and found that since the middle of the 18th century, 713 polychaete species (55 families) have been identified from the Indonesian waters. Of these, 301 species (40 families) were described from the geographic region. Through time, most polychaete samples were collected during the Siboga Expedition at the turn of the 19th century, most of which were identified by European taxonomists and deposited in museums in the Netherlands, but now centralised at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden. Marine benthic studies conducted by local scientists have yielded polychaete specimens, yet most were not identified to species level and not vouchered in a recognised institution. I discovered that the polychaete collections at the three largest polychaete repositories in Indonesia were mostly unidentified, unpublished, and not databased, suggesting that the taxonomic study of the polychaete fauna, at least locally, has been largely overlooked. I collected polychaete specimens from the Wallacea region and its surrounding waters, and discovered a new capitellid species formally named Capitella ambonensis Pamungkas, 2017. The species, which was discovered from a mangrove habitat on Ambon Island, differs from other Capitella species in the form of hooded hooks and the methylene blue staining pattern. Indeed, the polychaete material obtained from this fieldwork may contain more new species and may give a clue as to whether or not the Wallace’s Line is a real boundary for polychaete fauna.","Pamungkas, J.",,"Pamungkas, Joko, J.",,https://doi.org/2292/53395,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now imperative to improve the way we project the effects of future climate warming on fisheries. While estimating future climate-induced changes in fish distribution is an important contribution to sustainable resource management, the impacts on European small pelagic fish—representing over 50% of the landings in the Mediterranean and Black Sea between 2000 and 2013—are yet largely understudied. Here, we investigated potential changes in the spatial distribution of seven of the most harvested small pelagic fish species in Europe under several climate change scenarios over the 21st century. For each species, we considered eight Species Distribution Models (SDMs), five General Circulation Models (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways; RCPs). Under all scenarios, our results revealed that the environmental suitability for most of the seven species may strongly decrease in the Mediterranean and western North Sea while increasing in the Black and Baltic Seas. This potential northward range expansion of species is supported by a strong convergence among projections and a low variability between RCPs. Under the most pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5), climate-related local extinctions were expected in the south-eastern Mediterranean basin. Our results highlight that a multi-SDM, multi-GCM, multi-RCP approach is needed to produce more robust ecological scenarios of changes in exploited fish stocks in order to better anticipate the economic and social consequences of global climate change.","Schickele, A.; Goberville, E.; Leroy, B.; Beaugrand, G.; Hattab, T.; Francour, P.; Raybaud, V.",WOS:000581825300001,"Schickele, Alexandre, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/faf.12515,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Climate Change,,"ecological niche, exclusive economic zone, range shift, species distribution models, uncertainties ",Journal article,,,"Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, UMR ECOSEAS 7035, Nice, France.",France,climate change; ecological niche; exclusive economic zone; range shift; species distribution models; uncertainties,CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; SARDINELLA-AURITA; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; STOCK ASSESSMENT; ENGRAULIS-ENCRASICOLUS; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; ABSENCE DATA; MODEL; IMPACTS,Fisheries,Fisheries,Côte d'Azur University,,France,,University,Science

Concealment and other alternate solutions to the problem of predation, along with reproductive costs associated with having many arms, explain why the trend is wedge‐shaped rather than linear. Our findings constitute a latitudinal gradient in functional diversity, paralleling recent findings in other taxa. The gradient may be a consequence of shallow tropical reefs; inasmuch as reefs as centres of biotic interactions promote functional richness, changes in the distribution of reefs through deep time probably entailed shifts in the global deployment of ecological diversity.</p>                     </section>               </div>","Saulsbury, J.G.; Baumiller, T.K.",WOS:000574039900001,"Baumiller, Tomasz, T.K.","Univ Michigan, Dept Geol Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.13965,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",USA,Crinoidea; ecological diversity; functional morphology; latitude; macroecology; phylogenetic comparative methods,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; OXYCOMANTHUS-JAPONICUS; CRINOIDS ECHINODERMATA; PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; COURT JESTER; RED QUEEN; MARINE; BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,University of Michigan,,USA,,University,Science

The stacked species distribution models predicted the general patterns of observed invasive species richness in both study areas (Atlantic: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.52, Pacific: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.42). In the northwest Atlantic, we identified hotspots through much of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and southern Maine, and in several bays in southwestern New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the northeast Pacific, much of the southern Salish Sea was identified as a hotspot, as were a few areas along the outer coast of Washington and Oregon. Projecting our species distribution modelling results to 2075 (climate scenario RCP 8.5), we found that existing hotspots are likely to expand slightly in the Atlantic, while in the Pacific existing hotspots are predicted to shift or expand, new hotspots are likely to appear, and areas with few invasive species attaining moderate invasive species richness. Our results suggest that climate change will have larger effects on the distributions of our focal invasive species on the Pacific coast compared to the Atlantic. Resultant hotspot maps provide an integrated perspective and guidance to managers tasked with prioritizing locations for monitoring and implementing policy related to marine invasive species, with projected hotspots making planning for future changes in invasion risk possible.","Lyons, D.A.; Lowen, J.B.; Therriault, T.W.; Brickman, D.; Guo, L.; Moore, A.M.; Peña, M.A.; Wang, Z.; DiBacco, C.",WOS:000563714700002,"Lowen, Ben, J.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10530-020-02332-3,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,"Marine invasive species, Species distribution models, Climate change responses",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important aspect of studying migratory species is therefore to distinguish between movement and resident behavior. Telemetry is a rapidly evolving technique to study animal movement, but the number of data processing techniques to account for resident behavior remains limited. In this study we describe how models that were initially developed to predict human customer behavior, i.e. two-part and three-part models, provide new insights in the movement of migrating eel by accounting for resident behavior apparent from telemetry data sets. In econometrics, two-part models take into account that the decision of a customer to purchase an item and the decision of the customer on the purchase quantity of the concerning product, might be affected by different factors. Similarly, the factors that affect the decision of a fish to migrate or to stay resident might be different from the factors that affect the swimming speed of the fish. Telemetry data of eel movement in the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network (PBARN) of the Scheldt Estuary was used. This network with high detection probabilities allowed residencies to be recognized, defined, and introduced as zero values in a movement-residency data set. Two-part models, which consider movement decision, i.e. residency or movement, and movement intensity, i.e. swimming speed, as two different processes or parts of one larger model, outperformed one-part models that do not make that distinction. This underlines the complex migration behavior eels exhibit. These two-part models in turn were outperformed by three-part models that also accounted for cryptic (i.e. unobserved) residencies. While the one-part model identified the tides and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for movement, the three-part models identified the tides as most important for the movement decision and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for the movement intensity. Considering movement decisions, cryptic residencies and movement intensity in modeling efforts increased model performance by 9.8%, underlining the importance of acknowledging the potentially complex behavior animals exhibit.","Bruneel, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Luca, S.; Coeck, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.",WOS:000595067700009,"Moens, Tom, T.","Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109340,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Acoustic telemetry; Fish movement; Residency; Gate; Two-part and three-part model; Eel migration,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Acoustic telemetry; Fish movement; Residency; Gate; Two-part and three-part model; Eel migration,EELS ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY; SAMPLE SELECTION; DETECTION RANGE; 2-PART,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

This considerable increase in diversity occurs specifically at the beginning of the Magellanic Biogeographic Province. Within this province lies the Strait of Magellan, considered the most important channel because it connects the South Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These characteristics make it an interesting area for marine research; thus, the Strait of Magellan has historically been the area with the greatest research effort within the province. However, despite efforts there is no comprehensive and updated list of the diversity of mollusks within the Strait of Magellan up to now. This study consisted of a complete bibliographic review of all available literature that included samples of mollusks in the Strait of Magellan. More than 300 articles were reviewed, covering 200 years of scientific knowledge. There were 2579 records belonging to 412 taxa, of which 347 are valid species. Of the total valid species, 44 (~13%) are considered of doubtful presence in the Strait.

In 2015, we embarked on a multi-disciplinary scientific expedition to conduct the first systematic characterization of deep-sea benthic invertebrate communities of the Galapagos, across a range of habitats. We explored seven sites to depths of over 3,300 m using a two-part Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) system aboard the E/V <i>Nautilus,</i> and collected 90 biological specimens that were preserved and sent to experts around the world for analysis. Of those, 30 taxa were determined to be undescribed and new to science, including members of five new genera (2 sponges and 3 cnidarians). We also systematically analysed image frame grabs from over 85 h of ROV footage to investigate patterns of species diversity and document the presence of a range of underwater communities between depths of 290 and 3,373 m, including cold-water coral communities, extensive glass sponge and octocoral gardens, and soft-sediment faunal communities. This characterization of Galapagos deep-sea benthic invertebrate megafauna across a range of ecosystems represents a first step to study future changes that may result from anthropogenic impacts to the planet’s climate and oceans, and informed the creation of fully protected deep-water areas in the Galapagos Marine Reserve that may help preserve these unique communities in our changing planet.","Salinas-de-Leon, P.; Marti Puig, P.; Buglass, S.; Arnés-Urgellés, C.; Rastoin-Laplane, E.; Creemers, M.; Cairns, S.D.; Fisher, C.; O'Hara, T.D.; Ott, B.; Raineault, N.A.; Reiswig, H.; Rouse, G.; Rowley, S.J.; Shank, T.M.; Suarez, J.; Watling, L.; Wicksten, M.K.; Marsh, L.",WOS:000563538800002,"Marsh, Leigh, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-70744-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",USA,,HYDROTHERMAL VENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PACIFIC; BIODIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSE; CORALS; IMPACT,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,National Geographic Society (NGS),x,USA,,Non-profit organization,Civil society

Cosmopolitan framework-forming species including <i>Madrepora oculata</i> and <i>Solenosmilia variabilis</i> were present but occurred in patchy distributions among the three seamounts. Framework-forming species occurred at or above the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon with stylasterid hydrocorals being the only coral taxon observed below Ω<sub>arag</sub> values of 1. Coral assemblage variation was found to be strongly associated with depth and aragonite saturation state, while other environmental variables exerted less influence. This study enhances our understanding of the factors that regulate scleractinian and stylasterid coral distribution in an underreported marginal sea and establishes a baseline for monitoring future environmental changes due to ocean acidification and deoxygenation in the tropical western Atlantic.","Auscavitch, S.R.; Lunden, J.J.; Barkman, A.; Quattrini, A.M.; Demopoulos, A.W.J.; Cordes, E.E.",WOS:000554409300002,"Auscavitch, Steven, S.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.9523,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Scleractinia, ""Stylasteridae""",Aragonite,,"Deep-sea coral, Seamount, Anegada Passage, tony coral, Lace coral, Community structure",Journal article,,,"Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",USA,Deep-sea coral; Caribbean Sea; Scleractinia; Stylasteridae; Seamount; Aragonite; Anegada Passage; Stony coral; Lace coral; Community structure,LOPHELIA-PERTUSA; SEA; COMMUNITIES; CHEMISTRY; REEFS; HABITAT; BIOLOGY; FLORIDA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Temple University,,USA,,University,Science

As improvements in information technology make it easier to communicate, access, and aggregate biodiversity information, there is a need for a framework that helps taxonomists and the users of taxonomy decide which taxa and names should be used by society whilst continuing to encourage taxonomic research that leads to new species discoveries, new knowledge of species relationships, and the refinement of existing species concepts. Here, we present 10 principles that can underpin such a governance framework, namely (i) the species list must be based on science and free from nontaxonomic considerations and interference, (ii) governance of the species list must aim for community support and use, (iii) all decisions about list composition must be transparent, (iv) the governance of validated lists of species is separate from the governance of the names of taxa, (v) governance of lists of accepted species must not constrain academic freedom, (vi) the set of criteria considered sufficient to recognise species boundaries may appropriately vary between different taxonomic groups but should be consistent when possible, (vii) a global list must balance conflicting needs for currency and stability by having archived versions, (viii) contributors need appropriate recognition, (ix) list content should be traceable, and (x) a global listing process needs both to encompass global diversity and to accommodate local knowledge of that diversity. We conclude by outlining issues that must be resolved if such a system of taxonomic list governance and a unified list of accepted scientific names generated are to be universally adopted.","Garnett, S.T.; Christidis, L.; Conix, S.; Costello, M.J.; Zachos, F.; Bánki, O.; Bao, Y.; Barik, S.K.; Buckeridge, J.S.; Hobern, D.; Lien, A.; Montgomery, N.; Nikolaeva, S.; Pyle, R.L.; Thomson, S.A.; van Dijk, P.P.; Whalen, A.; Zhang, Z.-Q.; Thiele, K.R.",WOS:000549187000001,"Bánki, Olaf, O.","GBIF Secretariat, Global Biodivers Informat Facil, Copenhagen, Denmark.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000736,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia.",Australia,,TAXONOMY; CONSERVATION; UNITS,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,GBIF Global Biodiversity Information Facility,,Global,,Data infrastructure,Science

There is also a rise in the export of electronic waste (e-waste) from developed countries to countries in the region, purportedly as reusable electronics, much of which ends up in landfills. The primitive recycling techniques of this e-waste undermines the health of the local populations and their environment due to inadequate care of the heavy metal and toxin content. Drawing on examples from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana, this paper argues that toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea amounts to environmental racism. The article makes recommendations relating to the challenges of toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea, including the need for countries to implement the provisions of the Basel and Bamako conventions in their entirety, recognise acts of environmental racism as violations of human rights, and for young people to rise to the occasion as ‘agents of change’.","Okafor-Yarwood, I.; Adewumi, I.J.",WOS:000578299500001,"Okafor-Yarwood, Ifesinachi, I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/00020184.2020.1827947,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"Bamako Convention, Basel Convention, Africa, environmental justice, e-waste",Journal article,,,"Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",Scotland,Bamako Convention; Basel Convention; Africa; environmental justice; e-waste,,Area Studies,Area Studies,University of St Andrews,,UK,,University,Science

Some species are actually circum-Antarctically or circum-sub-Antarctically distributed, but some other species actually comprise species’ complexes, with cryptic taxa occurring at different areas. However, to date, few of the invertebrate species formerly reported as widespread in the Southern Ocean have been re-analyzed using genetic techniques. This study examined whether two geographically distant areas of the sub-Antarctic region under the influence of the ACC, the Southern tip of South America (SSA) and the Prince Edward Islands (PEI), share some marine invertebrate species. For that, members of two genera of bivalves, <i>Gaimardia</i> and <i>Hiatella</i>, were selected. As part of this study, we found extremely low genetic differentiation between specimens from SSA and PEI.  In addition, shared haplotypes were found between these two areas. Our results confirm that <i>Gaimardia trapesina</i> and one same species of <i>Hiatella</i> (“<i>Hiatella</i> O”) are present in both areas. Given that these two species are found on macroalgae, natural rafts appear as the most plausible means of dispersal of juveniles and adults, although in the case of <i>Hiatella</i> O, additional larval dispersion cannot be discarded. In any of these cases, dispersion should be facilitated (or even determined) by the ACC. Thus, this study provides new evidence in favour of considering the ACC as an effective dispersive agent in the Southern Ocean.","Güller, M.; Puccinelli, E.; Zelaya, D.G.",WOS:000569774900003,"Puccinelli, Eleonora, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-020-03746-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",Argentina,,LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; WEST-WIND-DRIFT; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; MARINE BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS; DRAKE PASSAGE; KELP RAFTS; TRANSPORT; PATTERNS; ISLANDS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas),,Argentina,,Governmental body,Policy

Nine species were identified as threats to the fishing industry, marine aquaculture, power plant operation, coastal tourism or human health, while eight species are providing economic benefits to the jellyfish fishery and aquarium trade.","Syazwan, W.M.; Rizman-Idid, M.; Low, L.B.; Then, A.Y.-H.; Chong, V.C.",WOS:000579792200008,"Chong, Ving Ching, V.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101444,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Malaysia,"Medusae, ""Scyphozoa""",,,"Species distribution, Population blooms",Journal article,,,"Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",Malaysia,Medusae; Scyphozoa; Species distribution; Population blooms; Malaysia,LOW DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; GELATINOUS ZOOPLANKTON; PELAGIC CNIDARIANS; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; POWER-PLANT; FISHERIES; FISH; SEA; PHYTOPLANKTON; RHIZOSTOMEAE,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Malaya - Institute of Biological Sciences,x,Malaysia,,Research institute,Science

We investigated how individuals adjusted their foraging behaviour after relocating to another colony due to breeding site destruction, and whether there were any reproductive consequences in the first years after relocation. To this end, we compared offspring growth between resident individuals and individuals that recently relocated to the same colony due to breeding habitat loss. Using GPS-tracking, we further investigated the foraging behaviour of resident individuals in both colonies, as well as that of relocated individuals, as enhanced foraging effort could represent a potential driver of reproductive costs.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Results</h3><p>We found negative consequences of relocation for offspring development, which were apparent when brood demand was experimentally increased. Recently relocated gulls travelled further distances for foraging than residents, as they often visited more distant foraging sites used by residents breeding in their natal colony as well as new areas outside the home range of the residents in the colony where they settled.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusions</h3><p>Our results imply that relocated individuals did not yet optimally adapt to the new food landscape, which was unexpected, given the social information on foraging locations that may have been available from resident neighbours in their new breeding colony. Even though the short-term reproductive costs were comparatively low, we show that generalist species, such as the Lesser black-backed gull, may be more vulnerable to habitat loss than expected. Long term studies are needed to investigate how long individuals are affected by their relocation in order to better assess potential population effects of (breeding) habitat loss.</p>","Kavelaars, M.M.; Baert, J.M.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Shamoun-Baranes, J.; Lens, L.; Müller, W.",WOS:000592067100001,"Kavelaars, Marwa, M.M.","Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology (BECO) Researchgroup, University of Antwerp",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40462-020-00231-9,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,Foraging behaviour,,"GPS tracking, Behavioural plasticity, Habitat destruction, Lesser black-backed gull, Seabirds, Early development",Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,GPS tracking; Foraging behaviour; Behavioural plasticity; Habitat destruction; Lesser black-backed gull; Seabirds; Early development,BLACK-BACKED GULLS; SITE FIDELITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; HATCHING ASYNCHRONY; GPS TRACKING; BEHAVIOR; CONSEQUENCES; SPECIALIZATION; INFORMATION,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Antwerp - Faculty of Science - Department of Biology - Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology (BECO),x,Belgium,x,University,Science

Of particular interest is determining whether the frequency of recent intense hurricane landfalls in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is within or outside the natural range of intense hurricane activity prior to 1851 CE. In this study, we identify intense hurricane landfalls in northwest Florida during the past 2000 years based on coarse anomaly event detection from two coastal lacustrine sediment archives. We identified a historically unprecedented period of heightened storm activity common to four Florida panhandle localities from 650 to 1250 CE and a shift to a relatively quiescent storm climate in the GOM spanning the past six centuries. Our study provides long-term context for events like Hurricane Michael and suggests that the observational period 1851 CE to present may underrepresent the natural range in landfalling hurricane activity.","Rodysill, J.R.; Donnelly, J.P.; Sullivan, R.; Lane, P.D.; Toomey, M.; Woodruff, J.D.; Hawkes, A.D.; MacDonald, D.; d’Entremont, N.; McKeon, K.; Wallace, E.; van Hengstum, P.J.",WOS:000587665600004,"van Hengstum, Peter, P.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-75874-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",USA,,TROPICAL CYCLONE INTENSITY; EL-NINO; SURGE THREAT; CLIMATE; SEDIMENTS; RECORD; FLORIDA; IMPACT; RECONSTRUCTION; VARIABILITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Brown University,,USA,,Research institute,Science

The northeastern region of Brazil contains several basins south of the Potiguar Basin which originated from the rifting that resulted from the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, and thus contain an important record of the Cretaceous Period. This paper has the objective of studying the ostracods recovered from two adjacent sections (Transnordestina A and Transnordestina B) belonging to the Orós Formation, Iguatu Basin, Ceará, Brazil, detailing their taxonomy and developing biostratigraphic inferences based on the observed fauna.
