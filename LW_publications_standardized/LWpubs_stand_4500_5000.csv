0,331227,2020,M,A compilation and meta-analysis of salmon diet data from the north Pacific Ocean,"<b>Graham, C.</b> (2020). A compilation and meta-analysis of salmon diet data from the north Pacific Ocean. MSc Thesis. University of British Columbia: Vancouver.  ","Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers through dynamic ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean, however, their open ocean life phase is poorly understood with limited research comparing salmon trophic ecology across the entire basin. Understanding the marine trophic ecology of salmon has the potential to reveal information about ocean conditions, competition, prey abundance, as well as salmon health and survival. The first goal of this research was to build an open-access database to centralize Pacific salmon diet data using a standardized format (‘North Pacific Marine Salmon Diet Database’). This database was then populated with an initial data set that came from 62 sources identified through a systematic literature review, targeting peer reviewed and gray literature from time periods with high research activity: 1959–1969 and 1987–1997. The second goal was to examine spatial and interspecies differences in diet and trophic niche for chum, pink and sockeye salmon across the North Pacific between 1959 and 1969, a period during a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and prior to significant hatchery enhancement. In the Western Subarctic, all species tended to consume zooplankton and prey availability was higher than the Eastern Subarctic. In the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Subarctic, interspecies differences in diet were most apparent with chum and sockeye specializing on zooplankton and micronekton, respectively, while pink ate a mixture of zooplankton and micronekton. In the Bering Sea chum ate zooplankton while sockeye and pink alternated between zooplankton and micronekton. In addition to the large-scale trophic patterns, these data revealed novel fine-scale spatial trophic patterns, including latitudinal, onshore-offshore, and cross-gyre gradients. These results showed that pink were more generalist consumers, and their diets may be a better reflection of overall prey presence and abundance in the environment. Conversely, chum and sockeye were more specialist consumers, and their diets may be a better reflection of interspecies dynamics and/or specific prey presence and abundance of zooplankton and micronekton, respectively. Overall, this research provides an open-access database that can help address gaps in ecological understanding of the North Pacific, as well as complementary data analyses to further understanding of salmon marine ecology.","Graham, C.",,"Graham, Caroline, C.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on unique time-series (1980–2017), this study addresses successional patterns of hard-bottom benthos in two fjords in NW Svalbard after a pulse perturbation in 1980 and during a period of rapid climate warming. Analysis of seafloor photographs revealed different return rates of taxa, and variability in species densities, through time. It took 13 and 24 years for the community compositions of cleared and control transects to converge in the two fjords. Nearly two decades after the study initiation, an increase in filamentous and foliose macroalgae was observed with a subsequent reorganization in the invertebrate community. Trait analyses showed a decrease in body size and longevity of taxa in response to the pulse perturbation and a shift towards small/medium size and intermediate longevity following the macroalgae takeover. The observed slow recovery rates and abrupt shifts in community structure document the vulnerability of Arctic coastal ecosystems to perturbations and continued effects of climate warming.","Al-Habahbeh, A.M.; Kortsch, S.; Bluhm, B.A.; Beuchel, F.; Gulliksen, B.; Ballantine, C.; Cristini, D.; Primicerio, R.",WOS:000567547600004,"Bluhm, Bodil, B.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rsta.2019.0355,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Climate Change,,"community ecology,  recolonization, succession, functional traits",Journal article,,,"Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Res Dept, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14, N-9009 Tromso, Norway.",Norway,community ecology; climate change; recolonization; succession; functional traits,FJORD KONGSFJORDEN; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; RECOLONIZATION; INVERTEBRATES; SUCCESSION; TRAITS; COLONIZATION; DISTURBANCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Norwegian Polar Institute,,Norway,,Research institute,Science

Habitat characteristics and geographical origin may predict invasion success, and in aquatic environments could be mediated principally by salinity tolerance. Crustacean invaders are causing global problems and we urgently require better predictive power of their invasiveness. Here, we compiled global aquatic gammarid (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaroidea) diversity and examined their salinity tolerances and regions of origin to test whether these factors predict invasion success. Across 918 aquatic species within this superfamily, relatively few gammarids (n = 27, 3%) were reported as aliens, despite extensive invasion opportunities and high numbers of published studies on amphipod invasions. However, reported alien species were disproportionately salt-tolerant (i.e. 32% of brackish-water species), with significantly lower proportions of aliens originating from freshwater and marine environments (both 1%). Alien gammarids also significantly disproportionally originated from the Ponto-Caspian (20% of these taxa) when compared with all ‘other' grouped regions (1%), and principally invaded Eurasian waters, with translocations of salt-tolerant taxa to freshwaters being pervasive. This suggests habitat characteristics, alongside regional contexts, help predict invasibility. In particular, broad environmental tolerances to harsh environments and associated evolutionary history probably promote success of aliens globally.","Cuthbert, R.N.; Kotronaki, S.G.; Dick, J.T.A.; Briski, E.",WOS:000568869000001,"Cuthbert, Ross, R.N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0354,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Biodiversity,,"aquatic aliens, invasion success, Ponto-Caspian, predicting invaders, salinity regime",Journal article,,,"Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Global Food Secur, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",North Ireland,aquatic aliens; biodiversity; invasion success; Ponto-Caspian; predicting invaders; salinity regime,GREAT-LAKES; NORTH; SUCCESS,Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Queen's University of Belfast (QUB),x,UK,,University,Science

They take into account recent findings, previously missed records, back-dated records based on the re-examination of existing material or phylogenetic studies and changes in nomenclature. During the period 2017-2019, 70 new species were added to the inventory of established species, 25 that had escaped our attention in the past and 23 newly introduced, which have already established self-sustaining populations. Meanwhile, 22 species previously known only with casual records have established viable populations and a total of 36 species have expanded their distribution into new Marine Strategy Framework Directive regions, primarily the Central Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea. Intensified research efforts, prompted by the reporting obligations created by recent legislation, complemented by ever expanding networks and initiatives involving citizen scientists have certainly contributed to higher rates of discovery of alien species presences. However, the expansion of tropical and sub-tropical species into the cooler waters of the Aegean, the Adriatic and the western Mediterranean indicates that the warming of Mediterranean waters due to climate change is also facilitating the geographic expansion of NIS in the region. The rate of new introductions in this 3-year period is 8 species per year for the whole Mediterranean, without taking into account casual records or species with reporting lags. Only 4 species per year enter through the Suez Canal, while a considerable number of species are introduced through shipping vectors and the aquarium trade. Acknowledging the dynamic nature of invasions and the uncertainty inherent in compiling check lists, we consider the present work as the most accurate and up-to-date NIS list to inform policy, management and decision-making.","Zenetos, A.; Galanidi, M.",,"Galanidi, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s41200-020-00191-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Alien species,,"Mediterranean inventory, Updates, Range expansion",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are used as a sea vegetable in many Asian countries and are becoming increasingly popular in western cuisine. This has led to the development of cultivation of this genus in Europe. As the species in the genus are adapted to temperate-to-cold waters in the northern hemisphere, its distribution is restricted to specific zones, e.g. <i>Alaria esculenta</i>, to the 16&nbsp;°C isotherm explaining its absence in the southern North Sea and beyond the English Channel to the south. It has been observed that the genus <i>Alaria</i> has a high level of morphological plasticity and over 40 different species have been ascribed to the genus in the last century. Most species have been described from the North Pacific in cold temperate waters of the northern hemisphere and only a few from the North Atlantic. Recent advances in taxonomy and phylogeny have reduced several species to the <i>Alaria marginata</i> complex and the polymorphic <i>Alaria esculenta</i> species complex and moved one species to a new genus reducing the number to eight species and one sister species. <i>Alaria</i> mostly occupies wave-exposed subtidal rocky shores and is of interest for its food value and cultivation potential. Aquaculture of <i>Alaria</i> is highly attractive due to easy practices, fast growth and economic benefits (job creation, processing etc) and environmental benefits (bioremidiation, IMTA, carbon sink). <i>Alaria</i> is traditionally consumed in Japan, Russia, Europe and North America; and its popularity is on the increase due to changing nutritional habits in the global population.

A comparison of the <span class=""html-italic"">My. quadricornis</span> mt genomes obtained by us with other complete mt genomes available in GenBank has revealed a surprisingly low divergence (3.06 ± 0.12%) with <span class=""html-italic"">Megalocottus platycephalus</span> and, at the same time, a significantly higher divergence (7.89 ± 0.16%) with the species of the genus <span class=""html-italic"">Myoxocephalus</span>. Correspondingly, phylogenetic analyses have shown that <span class=""html-italic"">My. quadricornis</span> is clustered with <span class=""html-italic"">Me. platycephalus</span> but not with the <span class=""html-italic"">Myoxocephalus</span> species. Completely consistent patterns of divergence and tree topologies have been obtained based on nuclear rDNA. Thus, the multi-gene data in the present work indicates obvious contradictions in the relationships between the <span class=""html-italic"">Myoxocephalus</span> and <span class=""html-italic"">Megalocottus</span> species studied. An extensive phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for a closer affinity of <span class=""html-italic"">My. quadricornis</span> with the species of the genus <span class=""html-italic"">Megalocottus</span> than with the species of the genus <span class=""html-italic"">Myoxocephalus</span>. A recombination analysis, along with the additional GenBank data, excludes introgression and/or incorrect taxonomic identification as the possible causative factors responsible for the observed closer affinity between the two species from different genera. The above facts necessitate realignment of the genera <span class=""html-italic"">Myoxocephalus</span> and <span class=""html-italic"">Megalocottus</span>.

Despite being a widespread behaviour, little is known about the ecology and evolution of phoresy. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review of phoretic dispersal in animals and to bring renewed attention to this subject. We surveyed literature published between 1900 and 2020 to understand the extent of known higher‐level taxonomic diversity (phyla, classes, and orders) and functional aspects of animals that use phoretic dispersal. Species dispersing phoretically have been observed in at least 13 animal phyla, 25 classes, and 60 orders. The majority of known phoronts are arthropods (Phylum Euarthropoda) in terrestrial habitats, but phoronts also occur in freshwater and marine environments. Marine phoronts may be severely under‐represented in the literature due to the relative difficulty of studying these systems. Phoronts are generally small with low mobility and use habitats or resources that are ephemeral and/or widely dispersed. Many phoronts are also parasites. In general, animals that engage in phoresy use a wide variety of morphological and behavioural traits for locating, attaching to, and detaching from dispersal hosts, but the exact mechanisms behind these activities are largely unknown. In addition to diversity, we discuss the evolution of phoresy including the long‐standing idea that it can be a precursor to parasitism and other forms of symbioses. Finally, we suggest several areas of future research to improve our understanding of phoresy and its ecological and evolutionary significance.","Bartlow, A.W.; Agosta, S.J.",WOS:000568749700001,"Agosta, Salvatore, S.J.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/brv.12654,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Parasitism, ""Symbiosis""",,"animal–animal interaction, animal-mediated dispersal, arthropod, dispersal host, hitch-hiking, phoront, species interaction, zoochory",Journal article,,,"Los Alamos Natl Lab, Biosecur & Publ Hlth, Mailstop M888, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",USA,animal-animal interaction; animal-mediated dispersal; arthropod; dispersal host; hitch-hiking; parasitism; phoront; species interaction; symbiosis; zoochory,CORDYLOCHERNES-SCORPIOIDES PSEUDOSCORPIONIDA; POLYPHAGOTARSONEMUS-LATUS ACARI; MITES ACARI; BEETLES COLEOPTERA; BARK BEETLES; N.

Investigations into such shifts are critical for understanding the complex interaction between co-opting existing traits for new functions and novel traits that originate during or post-transition. Gastropod mollusks are of particular interest in regard to benthic-pelagic evolutionary transitions, as shifts from benthic to pelagic habitats are uncommon. <i>Phylliroe</i> is one such pelagic lineage in Phylliroidae, a family of holoplanktonic nudibranchs with a highly aberrant morphology that appears to be adapted for life in the pelagic zone. However, the phylogenetic placement of this enigmatic group of pelagic nudibranchs has never been investigated. Here we present phylogenomic analyses which place <i>Phylliroe</i> within a group of nudibranchs called Dendronotida sensu stricto. We also discuss a subset of the morphological and behavioral features that <i>Phylliroe</i> shares with other closely related lineages (Dendronotidae, Tethyidae, and Scyllaeidae) and some that are unique to <i>Phylliroe</i>. Based on these data, and a literature review, we find a number of unique features found in <i>Phylliroe</i> that are adaptations to a pelagic environment, such as a fish-like body plan, highly reduced connective and muscular tissue in the notum, and elongated rhinophores. However, we were able to identify only a single commonality among <i>Phylliroe</i> and its closely related lineages, which is the presence of left-right swimming behavior. We further hypothesize that swimming behavior in this group likely represents an important trait that facilitated the transition from benthic to pelagic environments, and thus may provide evidence that major pelagic lifestyle transitions can rely on behavioral exaptations. These new insights into the origins of <i>Phylliroe</i> now provide a phylogenetic framework for testing for adaptations necessary for the benthic-pelagic transition in this group.","Goodheart, J.A.; Wägele, H.",WOS:000568230400001,"Goodheart, Jessica, J.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13127-020-00458-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Cladobranchia,,,"Nudibranch, Exaptation, Holoplanktonic, Swimming behavior",Journal article,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",USA,Nudibranch; Exaptation; Holoplanktonic; Swimming behavior; Cladobranchia,FIELD BEHAVIOR; BIOLUMINESCENCE; PTEROPOD; MOLLUSCA; PERFORMANCE; CEPHALOPODS,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,University of California - San Diego,x,USA,,University,Science

Juvenile densities (ranging from 14 to 36 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>) varied among depth zone and reef type interactions and had a bimodal distribution, with the middle zone having the lowest density compared to the shallow and deep zones. Juvenile densities were correlated to benthic cover, particularly to high algal cover in the middle zone and availability of bare hard substrate in the shallow zone. Adult densities were also correlated with juvenile densities, but not commonly in the middle zone, emphasizing that it is only one of the many variables that contribute to juvenile assemblages.

Reconstructing and assessing fisheries in three oceans. MSc Thesis. University of British Columbia: Vancouver. xiv, 123 pp.","Canada’s marine fisheries occur in three oceans, designated by Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), where management bodies utilize catch records in order to make decisions regarding the future of their fisheries. However, current catch reporting systems and stock assessment processes are flawed, as catch records are missing key fishery components and assessments may use time series that do not represent the full scale of change. These shortcomings can directly impact the perception of healthy fisheries and influence future management decisions. This research provides a comprehensive catch record for all available marine populations in Canada’s three surrounding EEZs from 1950-2017 in order to estimate their current status and provide reference points that may be useful for managers to secure marine resources for the future. Catch reconstructions initially done by the Sea Around Us group and external collaborators, are refined and updated to 2017. Using reconstructed time series, the most recent ‘CMSY’ stock assessment method allows reference points to be estimated and reveals that the majority of Canadian fisheries need rebuilding. As well, ‘CMSY’ analyses are used to investigate shifting baseline effects on selected official stock assessments that exhibit shortened catch time series. Overall, this research contributes to improving scientific baselines in order to gain a better understanding of Canadian fisheries from a historical and managerial perspective.","Schijns, R.",,"Schijns, Rebecca, R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current hydro-climatic variability and its effects on coastal environments raise the question of ENSO’s occurrences and evolution during the Holocene. The Sechura desert is now very sparsely occupied, while many archaeological sites indicate a significant human presence from the 5th millennium BC. Our research focuses on the adaptation of these local populations to variation in climate and evolution of the coastal environment over time. A regional approach, integrating off-site data from sedimentary archives in the Las Salinas and Nunura bay regions and on-site data from the Bayovar-01 and Huaca Grande archaeological sites, highlights the variety of responses of these populations, which adapted their subsistence economies to these environmental fluctuations. Our results show that, over the past two millennia, the Sechura desert has experienced both permanent occupations that adapted to diverse resources and that varied over time, as well as short-term, opportunistic occupations that focused on specific and temporarily available resources. Thus our reconstructions testify to the strong reactivity of landscape and people to recent Holocene environmental change affecting the coastal areas of the Sechura desert.","Villa, V.; Christol, A.; Lefèvre, C.; Correa, D.; Béarez, P.; Wuscher, P.; Bermeo, N.; Vásquez, S.; Gutiérrez, B.; Goepfert, N.",,"Béarez, Philippe, P.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Archaeology, ""Geomorphology""",,"Sechura desert, Late Holocene, Las Salinas, Nunura",Book chapters,Conference paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This lack of data is aggravated by high fisheries exploitation, which causes a decline in large, abundant populations, even leading them to threat of extinction. Among that marine biodiversity, no group has a larger morphological variety than crustaceans. In this scenario, knowledge about the local biodiversity, its richness and seasonality, is essential for a qualified fisheries management. The Amazon continental shelf has one of the largest shrimp fisheries in the country, and due to the ecological and economic importance that crustaceans have in the region, a detailed study on their diversity is necessary. In this article, we use data collected in the Revizee Program.

Phytoplankton and zooplankton have been shown to be ecological indicators of the water quality status in estuary ecosystems. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that multiple pressures have on the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in estuarine ecosystems is essential. In this study, water samples from 29 stations were collected from the Liaohe Estuary over three different seasons, and biotic factors (i.e., phytoplankton and zooplankton) were obtained and compared. The results showed that there were significant temporal and spatial variations in the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities from the Liaohe Estuary. The correlation analyses showed that water temperature was the most important factor regulating the variation in phytoplankton communities, whereas the main driving force for the zooplankton was nutrient concentrations. Large amounts of nutrients entered the estuary in spring and summer due to intensive human activities in the Liaohe River basin. The inflows by the Liaohe River introduced some phytoplankton and zooplankton into the estuary, such as <em>Coscinodicus asteromphalus</em>, <em>Chaetoceros decipiens</em>, and <em>Schmacheria poplesia</em>. The impacts of Liaohe inflows on the estuary region gradually decreased as the distance from the inlet increased and this change was mediated by marine diffusion. The results from this study will improve knowledge about planktonic communities in estuarine ecosystems and provide a theoretical foundation for estuary environmental management.","Sun, Y.; Lin, H.; Yang, Q.; Liu, Y.; Fan, J.; Guo, H.",WOS:000593966000001,"Lin, Hongjun, H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115414,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Spatial distribution,,"Liaohe estuary, Planktonic community, Seasonal variation, Environmental factor",Journal article,,,"Natl Marine Environm Monitoring Ctr, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Liaohe estuary; Planktonic community; Seasonal variation; Environmental factor; Spatial distribution,ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY; BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; LAKE TAIHU; CONSERVATION; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; WETLANDS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

We propose a methodological approach to address such situations. Using hypothetical scenarios regarding the closure of the UK exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to a diverse subset of French vessels as an example, we develop a spatial discrete choice model that incorporates the possibility to adjust the resolution of choice sets at the fleet level to account for heterogeneous behavioral patterns across fleets.

Areas beyond national jurisdiction encompass more than 60% of the oceans and, three-dimensionally, approximately 95% of the biosphere. However, biological resources were excluded from part XI of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea dedicated to the Area. Difficulties in accessing samples, particularly from the deep sea, have long limited the exploitation of marine genetic resources. However, molecular techniques have allowed, in the past two decades, an unprecedented access to the invisible, leading to an explosion in biotechnological advances, including the use of marine compounds or genes in a diversity of applications spanning from the pharmaceutical, medical, agriculture, and food industries to bioremediation. The instrument being developed through the ongoing negotiations of States in accordance with Resolution 69/292 of the United Nations General Assembly shall address questions related to the conservation of biodiversity, but also the issue of access and benefit sharing (ABS) in relation to marine genetic resources (MGRs) in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). Those areas are not covered by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol, which apply to land and maritime areas within national jurisdiction. Expectedly, the negotiations raised the need to clarify essential concepts and definitions, including biodiversity, bioprospecting, sample and genetic resource. There was also a need to clarify the differences in the processes and protocols leading to the knowledge necessary to inventory, understand and protect biodiversity versus the development of molecules of interest that turn some molecule of heredity extracted from a sample into a marine genetic resource in the biotechnological, commercial, and industrial senses. The purpose of this Chapter is to offer some clarification and scientific definition of terms, as well as to describe the main steps necessary for the development of patentable biotechnologies. This reveals a clear difference, both qualitative and quantitative, between samples and marine genetic resources, a difference that may have been overlooked during the negotiations and subsequent implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, resulting in an ABS system that often comes at the expense of research for knowledge and conservation. This emphasizes the need to clearly delineate the scope of the debate, identify the points of confusion, and differentiate the solutions to come from this process from those that can come only from other processes, such as the improvement of WTO TRIPS rules for patent claims. The lessons that we can take from land will help establish a realistic ABS system associated with marine genetic resources and identify priorities for capacity building without hampering conservation.","Arnaud-Haond, S.",,"Arnaud-Haond, Sophie, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1163/9789004437753_004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seasonal variations in copepod and hyperiid communities following the monsoon have been reported. The mechanisms controlling these monsoon-driven seasonal variations in hyperiid communities were analyzed using data from the central SCS (CSCS) during 2014–2015. Hyperiids mainly aggregated at the transitional water zones driven by the interactions of the cyclonic gyre and anti-cyclonic gyre or the western boundary current (WBC) in the CSCS. The total hyperiid abundance was related to the Northwest Luzon Cyclonic Gyre during the northeast monsoon and the East Vietnam Cyclonic Gyre during the southwest monsoon. The hyperiid community structure was significantly affected by the temperature of the upper 100-m water layer and gelatinous plankton in the CSCS from summer to fall. Different hyperiid ecological groups occurred in different water masses in the CSCS. The areas of interaction between cyclonic and anti-cyclonic gyres or the WBC and the distributions of water masses changed following seasonal variations in surface currents. The seasonal change in transitional water zones and water masses caused the seasonal variations of hyperiid community to track the monsoon reversal. Comparison of our data with previous data for the tropical SCS and other tropical oceanic areas confirms that the species composition of hyperiids is similar to that of the tropical Pacific, and that the most abundant species of hyperiid communities are very much more abundant than other species in subtropical–tropical oceans. Confirmation of symbiosis between three abundant hyperiid species (<em>Lestrigonus bengalensis</em>, <em>Primno latreillei</em> and <em>Phronima sedentaria</em>) and some abundant species of gelatinous zooplankton in CSCS suggests that the symbiosis helps the most abundant species to dominate significantly. The seasonal species diversity and total abundance of hyperiids usually remain relatively constant, the occurrence of strong El Niño events leads to the abnormal low total hyperiid abundance in fall, and the weak Kuroshio intrusion causes the abnormally low hyperiid species diversity in fall in the CSCS.","Wang, L-g.; Ning, J-j.; Li, Y-f.; Du, F-y.",WOS:000600863100005,"Wang, Liang-gen, L-g.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102440,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",South China Sea,Hyperiidea,Currents,,"Amphipods,  Gelatinous zooplankton, East Asian monsoons",Journal article,,,"Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Amphipods; Hyperiidea; Gelatinous zooplankton; South China Sea; Currents; East Asian monsoons,GELATINOUS ZOOPLANKTON; CALIFORNIA CURRENT; EL-NINO; ASSEMBLAGES; PERACARIDA; CRUSTACEA; PACIFIC; GULF; ABUNDANCE; FEATURES,Oceanography,Oceanography,Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences,,China,,University,Science

In this study, we combine genetics and morphology to assess the diversity of Pterasteridae, a sea star family diversified in deep-sea and polar environments. Because of their derived anatomy and the frequent loss of characters during preservation, Pterasteridae are a suitable case for an integrative study. The molecular identification of 191 specimens (mostly from the Southern Ocean) suggests 26–33 species in three genera (<em>Diplopteraster</em>, <em>Hymenaster</em> and <em>Pteraster</em>), which match the morphological identification in 54–62% of cases. The mismatches are either different molecular units that are morphologically indistinguishable (e.g. <em>Pteraster stellifer</em> units 2 and 4) or, conversely, nominal species that are genetically identical (e.g. <em>Hymenaster coccinatus/densus/praecoquis</em>). Several species are shared between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (e.g. <em>Pteraster jordani/affinis</em>). In conclusion, the taxonomic status of some groups is confirmed, but for others we find the need to re-evaluate the taxonomy at both genus and species levels.

61,331452,2020,M,Polyphasic approach to the study of diatom diversity,"<b>Kollár, J.</b> (2020). Polyphasic approach to the study of diatom diversity. PhD Thesis. Palacký University Olomouc, Faculty of Science, Department of Botany: Olomouc. [Diff. pag.] pp.","Diatoms are one of the most species-rich groups of algae. As a group, they are cosmopolitan and adapted to almost all aquatic and some terrestrial habitats. Consequently, they are of great significance not only to fundamental research in the fields of biodiversity, evolutionary biology, ecology, and paleolimnology, but also for applied disciplines such as biomonitoring, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. For many of them, it is key to use correct taxonomic identifications which reflect an evolutionary history of the lineages in question. In this regard, one of the most serious challenges faced by contemporary diatomologists is the problem of cryptic and pseudocryptic species diversity. In the light shed by new technologies and approaches, many traditionally described diatom species appeared to be (pseudo)cryptic species complexes rather than single species. Several presumed species complexes are included in the genus Pinnularia, the P. gibba group among them. In this dissertation, I have gathered a data set of 105 P. gibba group strains with worldwide origin and used it to delimit species by means of a polyphasic approach. The primary (i.e., DNA-based) species delimitation based on two genetic markers and three automatized species delimitation methods revealed that the data set covered 15 species of the group. The secondary species delimitation rested in confrontation of this primary hypothesis with other available lines of evidence, namely with morphological, geographic, environmental and/or reproductive data. I conclude that the data set indeed covered 15 species many of which are (pseudo)cryptic with limited geographic distributions. An addition of more conserved genetic marker along with the fossil data allowed for an inference of time-calibrated phylogeny. The phylogeny further allowed for formulation and (in same cases) statistical testing of some evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses. For example, significant difference in cell-size was detected in different parts of the tree and the difference is currently best explained by an evolutionary origin. Concerning the identification of the delimited species, proposed diatom DNA barcode markers in rbcL and SSU rDNA can unambiguously distinguish even between (pseudo)cryptic sister species of the group. Furthermore, the taxonomic review of the group was initiated by formal description of one of the delimited species as P. lacustrigibba sp. nov. Finally, the dissertation led to a development of a novel probabilistic model of speciation which, perhaps, may form a theoretical basis for future development of a new kind of probabilistic species delimitation methods applicable even to incipient species (many of which are presumably cryptic) and most of the asexual lineages.","Kollár, J.",,"Kollár, Jan, J.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pinnularia,"Biogeography, ""Taxonomy""",,"cryptic species diversity, LSU rDNA, morphology, polyphasic systematics, rbcL, species, SSU rDNA",Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical for many groups of gastropods, caecid taxonomy is largely based on overt shell characters. However, identification of species using shell characteristics is problematic due to their rather uniform, tubular shells, the presence of different growth stages, and a high degree of intraspecific variability. In the present study, a first integrative approach to caecid taxonomy is provided using light-microscopic investigation with microsculptural analyses and multi-marker barcoding, in conjunction with molecular species delineation analyses (ABGD, haplotype networks, GMYC, and bPTP). In total 132 specimens of Caecum and Meioceras collected during several sampling trips to Central America were analyzed and delineated into a minimum of 19 species to discuss putative synonyms, and supplement the original descriptions. Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest <i>Meioceras nitidum</i> and <i>M. cubitatum</i> should be reclassified as <i>Caecum</i>, and the genus <i>Meioceras</i> might present a junior synonym of Caecum. Meiofaunal caecids morphologically resembling <i>C. glabrum</i> from the Northeast Atlantic are a complex of cryptic species with independent evolutionary origins, likely associated with multiple habitat shifts to the mesopsammic environment. <i>Caecum</i> invisibile Egger & Jörger, sp. nov. is formally described based on molecular diagnostic characters. This first integrative approach towards the taxonomy of Caecidae increases the known diversity, reveals the need for a reclassification of the genus <i>Caecum</i> and serves as a starting point for a barcoding library of the family, thereby enabling further reliable identifications of these taxonomically challenging microsnails in future studies.","Egger, C.; Neusser, T.P.; Norenburg, J.; Leasi, F.; Buge, B.; Vannozzi, A.; Cunha, R.L.; Cox, C.J.; Jörger, K.M.",WOS:000573114200001,"Neusser, Timea, T.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/zookeys.968.52986,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,Meiofauna,,"DNA taxonomy, marine biodiversity, molecular species delineation",Journal article,,,"Univ Algarve, CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",Portugal,DNA taxonomy; marine biodiversity; meiofauna; molecular species delineation; Mollusca,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; FAMILY CAECIDAE; SPECIES DELIMITATION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MOLLUSCA GASTROPODA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CECUM; RISSOOIDEA; SELECTION; REVISION,Zoology,Zoology,University of Algarve,,Portugal,,University,Science

Benthic collections were obtained in austral autumn (May/June 2007) and included a total of 21 epibenthic sledge samples taken from the upper slope between 218 and 1239&nbsp;m. Due to the contrasting environmental settings between the Chatham Rise and Challenger Plateau, in terms of surface productivity and habitat heterogeneity, we expected the abundance, regional (or gamma-) diversity and community composition of benthic isopods to significantly differ between the two regions, and furthermore local (or alpha-) diversity and abundance (density) to decrease with increasing depth. Consistent with our assumptions, multivariate PERMANOVA analysis revealed a clear distinction in species composition between the Chatham Rise and Challenger Plateau with satellite surface chlorophyll (Chl) <em>a</em> and bottom temperature being the main environmental drivers. In contrast to previous benthic studies from the same sampling campaign, however, differences in isopod density and diversity between the two regions were not significant, either at species, or generic and family level. In addition, no depth-related changes in abundance and diversity could be observed at any hierarchical level. Instead, isopod densities at species and generic level were positively correlated with satellite surface Chl <em>a</em> and %silt, whilst species and generic diversity could be positively linked to the amount of total organic matter (TOM) in surficial sediments. In total, 97 asellote species in 54 genera and 15 families could be identified from both regions, of which 90.7% were likely new species. Species diversity was average to high when compared to other regions in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, neither for Chatham Rise nor for the Challenger Plateau did the species accumulation curves reach an asymptote, indicating that additional samples are required to provide more robust diversity estimates.","Kaiser, S.; Lins, L.; Malyutina, M.; Mills, S.; Lörz, A.-N.",WOS:000579905100007,"Mills, Sadie, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2020.103368,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Crustacea,"Macrobenthos, ""Oceans""",,"Chatham Rise, Challenger Plateau, 20/20, Bathyal",Journal article,,,"Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Banacha St 12-16, Lodz, Poland.",Poland,Macrobenthos; Crustacea; Chatham Rise; Challenger Plateau; Oceans 20/20; Bathyal,CHATHAM RISE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SUBTROPICAL FRONT; PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY; CRUSTACEA ISOPODA; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; STANDING STOCK; COOK STRAIT; DEEP; SEA,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Lodz - Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection - Department of Invertebrate Zoology & Hydrobiology - Lab Polar Biology & Oceanobiology,x,Poland,,Research institute,Science

Though, it is still unclear if nematodes taxonomical attributes are driven by the same environmental drivers as their functional (biological traits) counterparts, or if their taxonomical diversity is also enhanced by their functional diversity. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated taxonomical (based on nematode genera abundances dataset) and functional attributes: trophic groups (TG) and life history strategies (LHS) of benthic nematodes collected from 35 sampling stations along the Sado Estuary, SW Portugal. Along with biological samples we measured environmental variables in the water and sediments as well as sediment grain size.</p><p id=""sp0015"">Our results demonstrated that taxonomy-based assemblages were mainly structured by the salinity gradient and further by the interplay of granulometry and organic matter content. Contrastingly, trait-based distribution patterns were largely driven by the variations in the above sediment dissolved oxygen concentration. This finding largely draw attention to the role that above sediment dissolved oxygen concentration exerts on nematode assemblages and their functional distribution patterns. Consequently, our results demonstrate that biological traits introduce a new dimensionality in multivariate data that otherwise could not be detected using solely taxonomical information, thereby enhancing our knowledge on ecological gradients existing within an estuary.</p><p id=""sp0020"">Additionally, we found a strong correlation between functional richness (based on the combination of TG and LHS traits) and diversity taxonomic metrics (species richness, Simpson and Shannon diversity), although no correlation was found between taxonomic diversity indices and single nematode ecological indices (ITD index of trophic diversity and MI Maturity Index).

This includes consideration of approaches to sampling design and field methods, taxonomic resolution and laboratory harmonization, metric selection and choice of algal groups, assessment of stressors and stressor/response relationships. A number of commonalities emerged during this process, particularly the focus on diatoms over other algal groups.

The network currently consists of 20 observatories distributed across European coastal waters and the polar regions, in which 134 ARMS have been deployed to date. Sampling takes place annually, either as short-term deployments during the summer or as long-term deployments starting in spring. The pilot phase was used to establish a common set of standards for field sampling, genetic analysis, data management, and legal compliance, which are presented here. We also tested the potential of ARMS for combining genetic and image-based identification methods in comparative studies of benthic diversity, as well as for detecting non-indigenous species. Results show that ARMS are suitable for monitoring hard-bottom environments as they provide genetic data that can be continuously enriched, re-analyzed, and integrated with conventional data to document benthic community composition and detect non-indigenous species. Finally, we provide guidelines to expand the network and present a sustainability plan as part of the European Marine Biological Resource Centre (www.embrc.eu).","Obst, Matthias; Exter, Katrina; Allcock, A.

South Africa has an ageing coal power fleet, which will gradually be decommissioned over the next 30 years. This creates substantial opportunity for a just transition towards a future energy mix with a high renewable energy penetration. Offshore wind technology is a clean electricity generation alternative that presents great power security and decarbonisation opportunity for South Africa. This study estimated the offshore wind energy resource available within South Africa’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), using a geographic information system methodology. The available resource was estimated under four developmental scenarios. This study revealed that South Africa has an annual offshore wind energy production potential of 44.52 TWh at ocean depths of less than 50 m (Scenario 1) and 2 387.08 TWh at depths less than 1 000 m (Scenario 2). Furthermore, a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation was conducted to determine the most suitable locations for offshore wind farm development within the South African EEZ. The following suitable offshore wind development regions were identified: Richards Bay, KwaDukuza, Durban, and Struis Bay. Based on South Africa’s annual electricity consumption of 297.8 TWh in 2018, OWE could theoretically supply approximately 15% and 800% of South Africa’s annual electricity demand with offshore wind development Scenario 1 and 2 respectively.","Rae, G.; Erfort, G.",WOS:000645040500003,"Rae, Gordon, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.17159/2413-3051/2020/v31i4a7940,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",South Africa,renewable energy; resource assessment; site selection; offshore wind energy potential; GIS spatial,MODEL,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,Stellenbosch University,,South Africa,,University,Science

We analyzed long-term changes in vegetation and elevation in mainland salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, to estimate the impact of non-native <i>Spartina</i> on the geomorphological resistance of salt marshes to sea level rise and on changes in species diversity. From 1989 to 2019, the <i>Spartina</i>-zone shifted and expanded upwards to elevations of the high marsh zone and <i>Spartina</i> increased in frequency in several salt marsh vegetation communities. At sites where <i>Spartina</i> dominated the vegetation already three decades ago, elevation and species diversity increased with a higher rate compared to sites lacking <i>Spartina</i>.

The political affordances of the ‘<i>coconut wireless</i>’. Rotumans on social media in the 2018 Fiji elections. <i>Pacific Journalism Review 26(2)</i>: 221-241","As a unique group of people, Rotumans make up less than two percent of Fiji’s population, and as a minority Indigenous ethnic group in Fiji, they have remained relatively hidden and silent in political affairs. Outmigration from the island has led to more than 80 percent of Rotumans residing outside of Rotuma. In recent times, the Rotuman diaspora has heavily relied on the use of ICTs and new media technologies as crucial tools for the reinvigoration of Rotuma’s culture. This in itself poses an intriguing paradox as internet connectivity on Rotuma is quite limited. However, social media platforms have been increasingly used by Rotumans outside of Rotuma, and have enabled increased connectivity and greater dissemination of information among the Rotuman diaspora. Recently, the primary purpose of such social media groups has evolved from merely being a tool for rekindling familial ties, to being a platform for political discourse on Rotuman issues. In essence, despite the scattered nature of the Rotuman population, digital technologies are offering Rotumans the affordance of being able to inform and educate themselves and their networks on political issues of Rotuman interest. By employing ethnography and netnography principles and through in-person and online engagement with Rotumans within and outside of Rotuma, this article examines the affordances that digital technologies offer Rotumans concerning national political discourse.

In several countries, restoration and reinforcement projects have been initiated. Better insight in <em>Ostrea</em> behaviour is needed to ensure sustainable conservation in the future. In order to acquire substantial numbers of oysters for eco-physiological and transplant experiments without threatening the small local population, indoor rearing facilities were set-up at Royal NIOZ. Here, a broodstock of 38 adults originating from the western Wadden Sea, produced over 21 million larvae in 10 batches within 3 months (Sept-Nov 2018). Release of larvae and rearing took place at a water temperature of 19.7 ± 0.6 °C and a salinity of 30.5 ± 0.5 PSU. Outbreaks of <em>Vibrio</em> bacteria did not occur. The growth rate before settlement was 1.5–1.7 μm per day, which was at the low end of growth rates reported in previous studies. The first competent larvae were observed 17–22 days after release. Size at settlement varied between 255−325 μm. Survival until settlement was 0.96−0.98 per day. After settlement, growth rates increased to 30−47 μm per day, with batches that were released in September having a significantly higher growth rate and initial size compared to larvae that were released later. Mortality from release to the end of the experiment (Feb 2019) was 0.04−0.05 per day. A cryopreservation trial did not result in living larvae after thawing, most likely due to their advanced development when preserved. The larvae and juveniles were negatively tested for the parasite <em>Bonamia ostrea</em> and can thus be used in oyster conservation and restoration projects. Recommendations for future breeding attempts include the use of a higher water temperature and slightly higher food concentrations.","Jacobs, P.; Greeve, Y.; Sikkema, M.; Dubbeldam, M.; Philippart, C.J.M.",WOS:000603384800028,"Dubbeldam, Marco, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100537,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Coastal; Biodiversity; Endangered species; Reproduction; Benthos; Aquaculture,Journal article,,,"Univ Utrecht, Dept Coastal Syst, Texel, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Coastal; Biodiversity; Endangered species; Reproduction; Benthos; Aquaculture,EUROPEAN FLAT OYSTER; BONAMIA-OSTREAE; STOCK RESTORATION; CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS; PACIFIC OYSTER; FRESH-WATER; PCR ASSAY; LARVAE; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE,Fisheries,Fisheries,Utrecht University,,Netherlands,,University,Science

The majority of phenomic data are contained in countless small, heterogeneous phenotypic data sets that are very difficult or impossible to integrate at scale because of variable formats, lack of digitization, and linguistic problems. One powerful solution is to represent phenotypic data using data models with precise, computable semantics, but adoption of semantic standards for representing phenotypic data has been slow, especially in biodiversity and ecology.

Exceptions can be found on the high, well-watered islands of the South Pacific. Streams on these islands support a rich freshwater molluscan fauna with several nerite taxa (Neritimorpha: Neritidae) exhibiting extremely long dorsal spines. We sought to assess the defensive capacity of these structures for several co-occurring nerite genera on the Island of Ovalau, Fiji. Our overarching hypothesis was that spines confer a defensive advantage. We tested four predictions for eight common taxa: (i) predator “rich” habitats (the creek entrance) would be dominated by spine-bearing nerites, (ii) spine-bearing species should be smaller in size, (iii) nerites with spines would exhibit lower levels of shell damage and (iv) nerites with spines should invest less in their shells (i.e., their shells should be thinner). Most of these predictions received support. Spine-bearing species dominated the entrance to the creek and were smaller in size. Levels of shell damage were low overall, with 2 of the 3 spinose taxa exhibiting no shell damage, as did many of the nonspinose taxa. Finally, shells of spinose species were 25% thicker, demonstrating increased rather than decreased investment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the elaborate spines of <span class=""html-italic"">Clithon</span> spp. play a defensive role.","Davis, A.; Rees, M.; Rashni, B.; Haynes, A.",,"Davis, Andrew, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/ecologies1010002,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Fiji,"Clithon, ""Neritina"", ""Neritona""",Defense,,Ovalau Island,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 34 holoplanktonic taxa and five groups of meroplankton were identified. In relation to the spatial and temporal variation of the zooplankton of the lagoon, the parameters evaluated showed significant results for both factors.

Despite the remarkable progress in the field of marine natural products (MNPs) chemistry, there are only a few open access databases dedicated to MNPs research. To meet the growing demand for mining and sharing for MNPs-related data resources, we developed CMNPD, a comprehensive marine natural products database based on manually curated data. CMNPD currently contains more than 31 000 chemical entities with various physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, standardized biological activity data, systematic taxonomy and geographical distribution of source organisms, and detailed literature citations. It is an integrated platform for structure dereplication (assessment of novelty) of (marine) natural products, discovery of lead compounds, data mining of structure-activity relationships and investigation of chemical ecology. Access is available through a user-friendly web interface at https://www.cmnpd.org. We are committed to providing a free data sharing platform for not only professional MNPs researchers but also the broader scientific community to facilitate drug discovery from the ocean.","Lyu, C.; Cheng, T.; Qiang, B.; Liu, N.; Wang, H.; Zhang, L.; Liu, Z.",WOS:000608437800065,"Lyu, Chuanyu, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/nar/gkaa763,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Peking Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, State Key Lab Nat & Biomimet Drugs, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,,PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Peking University,,China,,University,Science

We examined (1) the degree of vertical movement of particles released at different depths and locations; (2) the location of potential source populations for the deep-sea taxa protected by the closures; and (3) the degree of functional connectivity. A long-term oceanographic dataset (EN4) was queried to characterize the temperature and salinity regimes in each of the closed areas as a basis for interpreting recently published climate change projections. Using the Parcels Lagrangian particle tracking framework and the BNAM hydrodynamic model, we found enhanced connectivity over previously developed 2-D models and unexpected, current-driven, strong (to a maximum of about 1340 m) downward displacement at depth (450, 1000 and 2250 m), with weaker upward displacement except for the release depth of 2250 m which showed upward movement of 955 m with a drift duration of 3 months. The current velocities create down-stream interdependence among closed areas and allow redundancy to develop in some of the areas of the network, with some of the larger areas also showing retention. Source populations for sponges in the upstream closure are likely in adjacent waters of the Canadian continental shelf. Collectively this information can be used to inform management decisions related to the size and placement of these closed areas, and vertical velocity surfaces have potential for use in species distribution modeling of benthic species and habitats.","Wang, S.; Kenchington, E.L.; Wang, Z.; Yashayaev, I.; Davies, A.J.",WOS:000600132400025,"Wang, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-76617-x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, 1 Challenger Dr, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.",Canada,,LABRADOR SEA-WATER; SPONGE GROUNDS; FLEMISH CAP; GRAND BANK; CONNECTIVITY; DISPERSAL; LARVAE; NEWFOUNDLAND; ASSEMBLAGES; VARIABILITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Fisheries and Oceans Canada - Bedford Institute of Oceanography,x,,,,

DSM remains controversial, with some political leaders calling for a moratorium on DSM pending further research into its impacts. This paper highlights the need for governance architectures that are tailored to DSM. We conceptualise DSM as a type of complex orebody, which encompasses the breadth of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks that make a mineral source complex. Applying a spatial overlay approach, we show that there are significant data gaps in understanding the ESG risks of DSM. Such uncertainties are compounded by fact that there are no extant commercial DSM projects to function as a precedent – either in terms of project design, or the impacts of design on environment and people. Examining the legislation of the Cook Islands and International Seabed Authority, we demonstrate how regulators are defaulting to terrestrial mining governance architectures, which cannot be meaningfully implemented until a fuller understanding of the ESG risk landscape is developed. We argue that DSM be approached as a distinct extractive industry type, and governed with its unique features in frame.","Kung, A.; Svobodova, K.; Lèbre, E.; Valenta, R.; Kemp, D.; Owen, J.R.",WOS:000608237000002,"Kung, Anthony, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111593,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Seabed mining; Complex orebody; Source risk; ESG risks; Resource frontier; Environmental management,Journal article,,,"Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Australia,Seabed mining; Complex orebody; Source risk; ESG risks; Resource frontier; Environmental management,MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SOCIAL LICENSE; MANGANESE NODULES; COMMON HERITAGE; BUSINESS; ZONE; CRITICALITY; GOVERNANCE; METALS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Queensland,,Australia,,University,Science

A methodology based on DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) nighttime light data combined with regional gas flaring volumes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA-NCEI) has been developed to estimate flaring emissions. This method is validated in Nigeria where individual field company data are available. The spatial distribution of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, NMVOCs, CO, OC, BC, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> is derived for the African continent for the period 1995–2010.</p><p id=""abspara0015"">A range of the emissions due to flaring is estimated based on the range of emission factors (EFs) for each chemical species. An average decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of about 30% is found over Africa from 1995 to 2010, with Nigeria being the largest contributor to this reduction (up to 50%). Changes in the spatial distribution with time indicate local increases, particularly at offshore platforms, which are attributed to a lack of regulations as well as aging infrastructures in oil and gas fields.</p><p id=""abspara0020"">Comparisons with current inventories reveal differences in the location and magnitude of point source emissions. For chemical compounds such as NMVOCs and CH<sub>4</sub>, the ECLIPSE and EDGAR country-level values are considerably higher than the highest flaring emission estimated in this study for 2005. For species such as CO, OC, BC, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>, the emissions provided by the ECLIPSE and EDGAR inventories are generally within the same order of magnitude as the average values found in this study, with the exception of OC, BC and SO<sub>2</sub> in which EDGAR provides much lower emissions. These discrepancies are likely due to either differences in the methodologies used to estimate the emissions, in the values of the emission factors considered, or in the definition of flaring sector. Our current estimations suggest that BC, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> flaring emissions in Africa account for 1–15% (on average 7%), 0.5–8% (on average 2%) and 8–13% (on average 11%) of African total anthropogenic emissions, respectively. The contribution of flaring to African anthropogenic emissions varies widely among countries. For example, in Nigeria the average emissions due to flaring are estimated to be as high as 18% for BC, 10% for CH<sub>4</sub> and 50% for CO<sub>2</sub>, which is significantly greater than the continental average and highlights the importance of emissions in flaring areas.</p>","Doumbia, T.; Liousse, C.; Keita, S.; Granier, L.; Granier, C.; Elvidge, C.D.; Elguindi, N.; Law, K.",WOS:000456639900039,"Doumbia, Thierno, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.006,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP); Nighttime light; Emission factor; Flare; Chemical compounds; Africa,Journal article,,,"Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France.",France,Defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP); Nighttime light; Emission factor; Flare; Chemical compounds; Africa,BLACK CARBON; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; GAS; POLLUTION,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,,,,

An analysis based on the ProtectedSeas database, which includes information on regulated activities, found that 85% of U.S. waters are in managed areas that restrict living resource extraction at some level above generally applicable regulations, with 52% managed at a low level of protection and 3% managed as highly protected no-take areas. States with the most state waters area in no-take MPAs are Hawaii (~25%), California (~9%), and Oregon (~3%). The majority of highly protected areas in U.S. waters exist in low-populated areas of the Pacific, such as the Papahānaumokuākea and Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments. Under a quarter of U.S. waters are closed to bottom trawling, with the West Coast and Alaska each contributing one-third of trawl closures by area. Bottom trawling is prohibited in nearly 90% of West Coast waters. Focusing on waters off California showed that overlapping management and fishing gear restrictions can increase overall protection. In state waters, no-take MPAs account for roughly 9% of the area, while restricted take MPAs of different types cover 27% of the area. About 40% of California state waters are in some kind of MPA, while 13.4% of state waters have a high level of protection from fishing impacts. In federal waters off California, under one percent are in no-take areas while nearly all waters are subject to some kind of fishery restriction. Capturing regulatory information at the individual MPA and MMA level will improve assessments of current protection, inform planning of new protections, and provide ocean users a more accessible way to increase compliance through awareness.","Sletten, J.; D'Iorio, M.; Gleason, M.G.; Driedger, A.; Vincent, T.; Colegrove, C.; Wright, D.; Zetterlind, V.",WOS:000609164100003,"Wright, Dawn, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104340,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Ocean protection; Conservation targets; Marine spatial planning; Spatial database; Marine managed area; Regulatory seascape,Journal article,,,"26368 Simon Pl NE, Kingston, WA 98346 USA.",USA,Ocean protection; Conservation targets; Marine spatial planning; Spatial database; Marine managed area; Regulatory seascape,CONSERVATION; PROGRESS; BIODIVERSITY; NETWORK; SCIENCE,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,,,,,,

Here, we study NPF in Cyprus, an Eastern Mediterranean country located at the crossroads of three continents. We performed one-year continuous measurements of aerosol particles down to ~ 1 nm in diameter, for the first time in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region. These measurements were complemented with trace gas data, meteorological variables and retroplume analysis. We show that NPF is a very frequent phenomenon at this site and has higher frequencies of occurrence during spring and autumn. NPF events were both of local and regional origin, and the local events occurred frequently during the month with the lowest NPF frequency. Some NPF events exhibited multiple onsets, while others exhibited particle apparent shrinkage in size. Additionally, NPF events were observed during the night-time and during episodes of high desert dust loadings. Particle formation rates and growth rates were comparable to those in urban environments, although our site is a rural one. Meteorological variables and trace gases played a role in explaining the intra-monthly variability of NPF events, but did not explain why summer month had the least NPF frequency. Similarly, pre-existing aerosol loading did not explain the observed seasonality. The month with the least NPF frequency were associated with higher H2SO4 concentrations but lower NOx concentration, which is an indicator of anthropogenic influence. Air masses arriving from the Middle East were not observed during these month, which could suggest that precursor vapors important for nucleation and growth are transported to our site from the Middle East. Further comprehensive measurements of precursor vapors are required to prove this hypothesis.","Baalbaki, R.; Pikridas, M.; Jokinen, T.; Laurila, T.; Dada, L.; Bezantakos, S.; Ahonen, L.; Neitola, K.; Maisser, A.; Bimenyimana, E.; Christodoulou, A.; Unga, F.; Savvides, C.; Lehtipalo, K.; Kangasluoma, J.; Biskos, G.; Petäjä, T.; Kerminen, V.-M.; Sciare, J.; Kulmala, M.",,"Sciare, Jean, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/acp-2020-1066,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chapter begins with scrutinising the concept of energy security in various Turkish narratives and examines the Turkish actors’ positions on natural gas pipelines. Accordingly, it examines Turkish narratives on being an energy hub/energy terminal and discusses their positions regarding pipeline projects, such as the Trans Anatolian Pipeline and Turk Stream, and the developments in the Eastern Mediterranean. From a theoretical perspective, the chapter analyses the functioning of the primary institutions of security of supply, balance of power, great power management and modern sovereignty. Within this context, the AKP’s foreign policy and its linkage with the energy policy and Turkey’s relations with Russia are also scrutinised.","Korkmaz, D.",,"Korkmaz, Dicle, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-45774-7_4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of three short cores (19–46&nbsp;cm), despite being hindered by the effects of biomixing, allow the calculation of a sedimentation rate of 1&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;mm yr<sup>−1</sup>. Distribution with depth of Al-normalised concentrations of metals reflects an increasing trend since 1880 CE, related to the industrialization of the Basque coastal area. According to the Sediment Quality Guidelines applied, contents of Zn and Pb appear as a potential cause of concern, given that they exceed the values from which adverse biological effects can be occasionally expected. However, foraminiferal assemblages do not show recognizable changes along the cores following increasing trace metal concentrations. Finally, pollen results reveal an increasing trend of coniferous taxa and a parallel reduction of authochthonous Deciduous <em>Quercus</em>, probably as a consequence of reforestation works. Data obtained confirm that effects of coastal anthropogenic activities extend to the adjacent shelf, where muddy deposits are likely to act as a trap for contaminants.","Irabien, M.J.; Cearreta, A.; Gómez-Arozamena, J.; Gardoki, J.; Martín-Consuegra, A.F.",WOS:000600419000004,"Irabien, María, M.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.03.042,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Foraminifera,,,Metals; Foraminifera; Radiotracers; Pollen; Mud depocenter; Bay of Biscay,Journal article,,,"Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Dept Mineral & Petr, Apartado 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain.",Spain,Metals; Foraminifera; Radiotracers; Pollen; Mud depocenter; Bay of Biscay,SEDIMENTATION-RATES; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; BILBAO ESTUARY; HEAVY-METALS; MARINE SEDIMENT; LEAD-ISOTOPE; VASIERE BAY; MID-SHELF; N.

In this study, we presented the complete mitochondrial genome of <em>P</em>. <em>buccinoides</em>, a cold seep snail from the South China Sea. It is the first mitochondrial genome of a cold seep member of the superfamily Conoidea. The mitochondrial genome is 15,764 bp in length, and contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. These genes are encoded on the positive strand, except for 8 tRNA genes that are encoded on the negative strand. The start codon ATG and 3 types of stop codons, TAA, TAG and the truncated termination codon T, are used in the 13 PCGs. All 13 PCGs in the 26 species of Conoidea share the same gene order, while several tRNA genes have been translocated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <em>P</em>. <em>buccinoides</em> clustered with <em>Typhlosyrinx</em> sp., <em>Eubela</em> sp., and <em>Phymorhynchus</em> sp., forming the Raphitomidae clade, with high support values. Positive selection analysis showed that a residue located in <em>atp6</em> (18 S) was identified as the positively selected site with high posterior probabilities, suggesting potential adaption to the cold seep environment. Overall, our data will provide a useful resource on the evolutionary adaptation of cold seep snails for future studies.","Du, L.; Cai, S.; Liu, J.; Liu, R.; Zhang, H.",WOS:000608488200046,"Du, Lvpei, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0242541,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Phymorhynchus buccinoides,,,,Journal article,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Sanya, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,,SEA HYDROTHERMAL VENTS; TRANSFER-RNA GENES; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; MOLLUSCA; ADAPTATION; INFERENCE; ENVIRONMENTS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SEQUENCES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Chinese Academy of Sciences - Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn,x,,,,

The majority of the glacial and warm interval records have been interpreted to represent only the last, Weichselian, glacial cycle (119–11.7 ka). We have revised the crucial part of the existing stratigraphic documentation in central and southern Finland. Our findings show that a considerable part of the depositional record extends further back in time and is more complete than previously thought. One record may reach the Middle Pleistocene Holsteinian Interglacial (≈MIS 11), 424-374 ka ago, and a large number of records are tentatively attributed to the Middle Pleistocene Röpersdorf-Schöningen Interglacial (≈MIS 7) 243-191 ka ago. During this possible Röpersdorf-Schöningen Interglacial, the Gulf of Bothnia hosted larger alkaline and smaller dystrophic lakes surrounded by boreal pine forests in a continental climate with warmer summers and colder winters than today. The Eemian (≈MIS 5e) 131-119 ka sea coastal records show detailed evidence of the widespread intermixing of continental fresh and marine waters. During the Early Weichselian Brörup Interstadial (≈MIS 5c) 109-96 ka, central and southern Finland seem to have supported open birch forest tundra, later invaded by spruce; not boreal pine forest as earlier thought. The early birch vegetation faced a tundra phase which may be the Montaigu cooling event c. 103 ka ago. The revised palaeoenvironmental interpretation shows that the development during the three discussed warmer intervals is well in line with the central European vegetational development. Our palaeoenvironmental interpretations concerning Röpersdorf-Schöningen and Brörup warm intervals are preliminary and will need further investigations.

Surface salinity values, nutrient concentrations and the presence of coccolithophore species previously reported from the mid to lower euphotic zone all suggest upwelling from at least 80–100&nbsp;m depth. The surface waters of the channel were characterised with low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>:PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> (0.68:1) and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>:Si (0.04:1) ratios far below the Brzezinski-Redfield ratio indicating the presence of N-limitation and the possibility that these waters may be susceptible to anthropogenic N inputs.

Despite its significance for local productivity upwelling is tentatively estimated, via stoichiometric assumptions, to enhance local productivity by only 20%. The modest productivity response to upwelling may be explained by picoplankton (0.2–2&nbsp;μm) dominance of the phytoplankton community with this size-class representing ~80% of total chlorophyll-<em>a</em>. Nevertheless, important spatial variability was identified in larger size fractions and supported by taxonomic analyses with indications that the distribution of <em>Chaetoceros</em> spp. alone may be particularly relevant for understanding the variability in larger (&gt;20&nbsp;μm) chlorophyll-<em>a</em> size fractions. The location of upwelling has previously been shown to host large concentrations of small pelagic fish thus management of this regionally important resource would benefit from additional investigation of the underlying physical mechanism driving upwelling and subsequently how trophic interactions and ecosystem productivity are influenced.","Painter, S.C.; Sekadende, B.; Michael, A.; Noyon, M.; Shayo, S.; Godfrey, B.; Mwadini, M.; Kyewalyanga, M.",WOS:000612810000003,"Noyon, Margaux, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105462,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Gephyrocapsa,,,East african coastal current; Pemba channel; Upwelling; Western indian ocean; Biogeochemistry; Phytoplankton; Coccolithophores; Gephyrocapsa,Journal article,,,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England.",England,East african coastal current; Pemba channel; Upwelling; Western indian ocean; Biogeochemistry; Phytoplankton; Coccolithophores; Gephyrocapsa,WESTERN INDIAN-OCEAN; SPECIES COMPOSITION; OLIGOTROPHIC OCEAN; COASTAL WATERS; PHYTOPLANKTON; PLANKTON; ABUNDANCE; NITROGEN; ZOOPLANKTON; SEASONALITY,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,NOC (National Oceanography Centre),x,,,,

The aim of this study was to apply biomonitoring using macrobenthic structures on both spatial and temporal applications of monoculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) at Tembelas Island, Kepulauan Riau Province, Indonesia. Samples of sediment were taken from three fish farm locations, namely from an IMTA site, a monoculture site, and a reference site. Macrobenthic organisms obtained through rinsing, sieving, and sorting were then identified under a stereo-microscope. Diversity of the macrobenthic assemblages was analyzed with a Shannon-Wiener index (H’). Equitability was expressed through Pielou’s evenness index. Finally, Bray-Curtis’ non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) was used for similarities derived from log (X+1) transformed macrobenthic abundance to provide a visual representation of differences in their structure between sites over time. Results showed polychaetes exhibited differences in both variation and abundance of genera between the farm and reference site. The assemblage of macrobenthos at the IMTA site consisted of 9 genera of gastropods, 3 genera of bivalves, 5 genera of polychaetes, and 2 genera of crustaceans. At the monoculture site, 12 genera of gastropods, 4 genera of bivalves, 8 genera of polychaetes, 1 genera of crustaceans, and 1 genera of ophiuroid were observed. A relatively high abundance was observed at the reference site, with 27 genera of gastropods, 11 genera of bivalves, 3 genera of polychaetes, and 1 genera of crustacean. The favorable water conditions and possible absence of waste input from aquaculture resulting in a more suitable habitat for macrobenthic life may explain this relative abundance. Some of them were recognised as opportunistic taxa, i.e., <span class=""html-italic"">Capitella</span> sp., <span class=""html-italic"">Heteromastus</span> sp., and <span class=""html-italic"">Lumbrinereis</span> sp. Based on the diversity and evenness indices and the MNDS ordination, it can be concluded that the application of IMTA systems results in a suppressed or reduced potential impact on environmental disturbance due to aquacultural activities.","Putro, S.P.; Sharani, J.; Widowati; Adhy, S.; Suryono",WOS:000593235000001,"Sharani, Jeanny, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/jmse8110942,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,sustainable aquaculture; IMTA; macrobenthic assemblages; polychaetes; environmental disturbance,Journal article,,,"Diponegoro Univ, Fac Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Semarang 50275, Cent Java, Indonesia.",Indonesia,sustainable aquaculture; IMTA; macrobenthic assemblages; polychaetes; environmental disturbance,,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Engineering; Oceanography,Diponegoro University - Faculty of Science and Mathematics - Department of Biology,x,Indonesia,,University,Science

We measured temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, in situ, to determine whether these parameters could explain the observed variations in the community patterns of brachyuran zoea I. We collected zoeae I of 18 species of brachyurans. The dominant species were <em>Libinia dubia</em> H.

The temperature and dissolved oxygen were the highest during the rainy conditions and the salinity during the dry conditions in the southern transects. The highest species richness (14) and diversity (2.97 bits individual<sup>-1</sup>) were found in central transects during cold front conditions. However, we found the highest species richness and diversity during the dry conditions, in the southern transects. <em>Libinia dubia</em> presented the highest density during cold fronts with 1592 ± 127 zoeae 100 m<sup>−3</sup> in the northern transect, followed by <em>C. sapidus</em> in the north-central transect, this was observed for both species in the offshore zone.

Due to their unavoidable incompleteness, the already implemented “Rapid Assessment Surveys” at Abrolhos Bank deserve being completed, at least numerically, by implementing an appropriate extrapolation procedure, to avoid serious bias precisely due to ignoring both the number and the frequency distribution of those species still remaining undetected after Rapid Assessment Surveys. Complying with this concern, I report on the results of a numerical extrapolation of a previously achieved partial survey of the soft-bottom shelled-mollusc fauna at Abrolhos Bank. This numerical extrapolation provides least-biased estimates regarding not only the number of species which have remained unrecorded but, moreover, additional information on the respective frequencies of these still unrecorded species. As a result, the extrapolated total species richness at Abrolhos Bank reaches at least 435 shelled-molluscs species (instead of only 293 species actually recorded by the Rapid Assessment Survey), out of which 30 species (instead of 19) are expected to be Brazilian endemics. Accordingly, the soft-bottom shelled-mollusc fauna – an admittedly fairly reliable indicator for the whole marine biodiversity – definitely demonstrate the major biological interest of the whole reef ecosystem at Abrolhos Bank and the imperative necessity of implementing truly efficient conservation programs of this ecosystem.","Béguinot, J.",,"Béguinot, Jean, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.9734/arrb/2020/v35i1130304,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Bivalvia, ""Gastropoda""",,,"Rapid assessment survey, marine biodiversity, coral reef, bivalve, gastropod, sampling effort",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, understanding of this activity on the diversity of macroinvertebrates remains focused on the α component of species diversity, rather than community functioning. Thus, there remains much uncertainty regarding how each component of taxonomic (TD) and functional (FD) diversity respond to the activity both in freshwater and marine environments. Here, we assessed the effect of sand dredging on α, β and γ components of TD and FD during different dredging periods based on the response of macroinvertebrate communities over 4 years in the second largest freshwater lake in China. After three years of active dredging, substantial reductions in each component (α, β and γ) of TD and FD were observed within the dredged area. Moreover, after one year of natural recovery, a distinct restoration was observed with an obvious return in multiple facets of TD and FD indices. No such changes were observed within the adjacent and reference areas. Decreases in the multiple components of TD and FD within the dredged area were most likely associated with the direct extraction of substrate and associated benthic fauna and indirect variations of the water and sediment environment (e.g., increases in water depth and decreases in %Clay). Furthermore, dispersal processes and mass effects mainly contributed to the maintenance of TD and FD during the dredged and recovery stages. In addition, the fast recovery of TD and FD was also related to the simple taxonomic structure and highly connected nature of the study area. Our results suggest that a more precise experimental design (BACI) should be pursued to avoid potentially confounding effects (e.g., natural disturbance) because the sensitivity of diversity indices depends upon different experimental designs. Moreover, measurement of the impacts of sand dredging on macroinvertebrate diversity can be undertaken within a rigorous framework for better understanding the patterns and processes of each component of TD and FD under the sand dredging disturbance.","Meng, X.; Cooper, K.M.; Liu, Z.; Li, Z.; Chen, J.; Jiang, X.; Ge, Y.; Xie, Z.",WOS:000604429000019,"Chen, Juanjuan, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.116059,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Aggregate sand mining; Effects of sand mining; Taxonomic diversity; Functional diversity; Biodiversity partitioning,Journal article,,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Key Lab Aquat Biodivers & Conservat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Aggregate sand mining; Effects of sand mining; Taxonomic diversity; Functional diversity; Biodiversity partitioning,RAOS QUADRATIC ENTROPY; PARTITIONING DIVERSITY; PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; EVENNESS; RECOVERY; REVEALS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Chinese Academy of Sciences - Minististry of Agriculture - Inst Hydrobiol - Key Lab Aquaculture Dis Control,x,,,,

Furthermore, the data about the experimental conditions, such as exposure time, concentrations, cell and tissue-specific responses, snail species and nanoparticle types are discussed. Revised data showed that the toxic effects of NMs were reported for 21 snail species with medical, veterinary and ecological importance. The NM toxicity to snails is dependent on the physical and chemical properties of NMs, as well as their environmental transformation and experimental design. The NM bioaccumulation on snails was related to several toxic effects, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, following by oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins. The NM metabolism in snails remains unknown. Results showed the potential use of NMs in the snail control program.

Nematode abundance and diversity were highest in the northern site than the other sites, and nematode communities were clustered into three groups by sampling site.

Meanwhile, algal and sponge overgrowth/AGO (11.39% ± 2.5), sediment necrosis/SN (7.55% ± 0.9), predation scars/PS (6.08% ± 0.7) and physical damage/PD (2.29% ± 0.9) were the most prevalent among the eight identified states of coral compromised health. Altogether, 33 scleractinian genera were influenced, with <i>Fungia</i> predominantly exposed to YBD (&gt; 30% colonies), while <i>Porites</i> and <i>Acropora</i> were affected by UWS and WS (11–20% colonies), respectively. Overall, the severity of coral diseases and signs of compromised health, which is greater across the west coast and offshore areas compared to the east coast area, might be influenced by coastal development and tourism activities.","Akmal, K.F.; Shahbudin, S.",WOS:000579798400001,"Shahbudin, Saad, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s42974-020-00030-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Marine Sci, Kulliyyah Sci, Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah, Kuantan 25200, Pahang, Malaysia.",Malaysia,Coral reefs; Coral disease; Coral compromised health; Marine Park; Peninsular Malaysia,SPONGE TERPIOS-HOSHINOTA; YELLOW BAND DISEASE; PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PARTIAL MORTALITY; DIVING IMPACTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REEFS; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,International Islamic University Malaysia,,Malaysia,,University,Science

Significant variations of the features of the nematode communities in the horizontal scale and in time were found. In the rainy season (October), the nematode density noticeably decreased, and the species composition and dominant species, as well as such parameters of assemblages as diversity and structure, changed as compared to April. A total of 71 nematode species were recorded from the studied area but only four species have been found at all stations in both seasons. The reasons for this are the high spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions and their pronounced seasonal variations. Environmental conditions (granulometric composition of the bottom sediments, water temperature and salinity) were characterised by pronounced differences between stations as well as seasons. The precipitation (heavy rainfalls) in the intertidal zone of the estuary is the main factor responsible for seasonal changes of nematode assemblages.","Pavlyuk, O.N.; Trebukhova, Y.A.; Mordukhovich, V.V.; Zograf, J.K.; Yushin, V.V.; Tu, N.D.; Thanh, N.V.; Luong, C.V.",,"Pavlyuk, Olga, O.N.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"environmental conditions, intertidal, meiofauna, rainfalls, seasonal changes",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microplastics pose risk on human health due to their capacity to adsorb heavy metals and retention in various trophic levels. This research aims to characterize and quantify the microplastics present in slipper-cupped oyster (<i>Crassostrea iredalei</i>) in Cañacao Bay, Cavite City, Southern Luzon, Philippines. The oyster shell lengths and widths were measured using Vernier caliper. The total shell and meat weights were determined using an analytical balance. The extracted soft tissues of the samples were digested using 10% Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) for 24 hours at 60˚C. The solutions were filtered using Whattman Grade 1 Quantitative Filter Paper (pore size: 11 micron). Microplastics were photographed, classified, and characterized using a stereomicroscope. Eight hundred twenty-seven (827) microplastics were collected and classified based on their appearance and characteristics; 817 were classified as microfibers and 10 were microplastic fragments. Microbeads and microfoams were not found in the collected samples. No significant relationship between the shell length, width and weights with the number of microplastic present (p>0.05). Results indicate that microplastics can be assimilated by the oyster regardless of their sizes and weights. This study confirmed the presence of microplastics in Philippine oyster, <i>C. iredalei</i> and important management strategies are recommended to reduce or prevent the microplastic inputs in the marine ecosystem and trophic levels.","Obanan, S.P.; De Leon, E.L.; Salva, G.R.; Santos, D.K.T.; Segovia, D.E.; Uybarreta, R.J.",,"Obanan, Steve, S.P.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Crassostrea iredalei,,,"Crassostrea iredalei, microplastics, oyster",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, with at least 14 thyasirid species found in that region at depths exceeding 3,000 m. Some of them are the numerically dominant species in bottom communities. However, all members in that family have not yet been identified to the species level. Based on the material collected from 1953 to 2016 by five deep-sea expeditions, three new species of Thyasiridae (Mollusca: Bivalvia) are described from the abyssal and hadal zones of the northwestern Pacific. <i>“Axinulus” roseus</i> sp. nov. was found in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench at 9,000–9,583 m depth. This species has a large rhomboidal shell with strong commarginal sculpture, a well defined, long and deep lunule and escutcheon without an auricle, a ctenidium consisting of a single demibranch, extensively lobed lateral pouches, and a large prodissoconch with specific sculpture. It is one of the dominant species in terms of abundance in macrobenthic communities in the deepest basin of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench with a population density of up to 396 ind. m<sup>−2</sup>. The species has a shell length of up to 9.0 mm and it is the largest thyasirid with a single demibranch. <i>“Axinulus” oliveri</i> sp. nov. was found in a vast region of the northwestern Pacific on the abyssal plain adjacent to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, on the abyssal slope of the Kuril Islands, and in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench at 4,648–6,168 m depth. This species is characterized by its ovate-rhomboidal shell, a well defined, deep and long escutcheon with a distinct auricle, a ctenidium with a single demibranch, and extensively lobed lateral pouches. It is widespread in the northwestern Pacific and forms populations with a density of up to 36 ind. m<sup>−2</sup>. Scanning electron microscopic observation of the gills of <i>“A.” roseus</i> sp. nov. and <i>“A.” oliveri</i> sp. nov. revealed that these species are not chemosymbiotic. <i>“Axinulus” roseus</i> sp. nov. and <i>“A.” oliveri</i> sp. nov. are provisionally assigned to the genus <i>Axinulus</i>, because they differ from the type species of the genus in a number of morphological and anatomical features. <i>Parathyasira fragilis</i> sp. nov. was found on the abyssal plain adjacent to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench at 5,249–5,399 m depth. This species is distinguished by its very thin, fragile, dorsoventrally elongated, rhomboidal shell with very long anterodorsal margin and a long, wide, flat lunule.

For decades, most knowledge on the fungal diversity of the deep sea was obtained through culture-dependent techniques. More recently, with the latest advances of high-throughput next generation sequencing platforms, there has been a rapid increment in the number of studies using culture-independent techniques. This review brings into the spotlight the progress of the techniques used to assess the diversity and ecological role of the deep-sea mycobiota and provides an overview on how the omics technologies have contributed to gaining knowledge about fungi and their activity in poorly explored marine environments.

However species identity and genus-level taxonomic assignment of the tritoniids remain contested. Herein we present a taxonomic review of the family Tritoniidae using integration of molecular phylogenetic analysis, morphological and biogeographical data. For the first time the identity of the model species <em>Tritonia tetraquetra</em> (Pallas, 1788) and <em>Tritonia exsulans</em> Bergh, 1894 is confirmed. <em>T</em>. <em>tetraquetra</em> distributes across the large geographic and bathymetric distances in the North-Eastern (NE) and North-Western (NW) Pacific. In turn, at NE Pacific coasts the separate species <em>T</em>. <em>exsulans</em> is commonly occured. Thus, it reveals a misidentification of <em>T</em>. <em>tetraquetra</em> and <em>T</em>. <em>exsulans</em> species in neuroscience applications. Presence of more hidden lineages within NW Pacific <em>T</em>. <em>tetraquetra</em> is suggested. The long lasting confusion over identity of the species from the genera <em>Tritonia</em> and <em>Tochuina</em> is resolved using molecular and morphological data. We also disprove a common indication about “edible <em>T</em>. <em>tetraquetra</em>” at the Kuril Islands. It is shown that <em>Tochuina</em> possesses specialized tritoniid features and also some characters of “arminacean nudibranchs”, such as <em>Doridoxa</em> and <em>Heterodoris</em>. Diagnoses for the families Doridoxidae and Heterodorididae are provided. Taxonomy of the genus <em>Doridoxa</em> is clarified and molecular data for the genus <em>Heterodoris</em> presented for the first time. A taxonomic synopsis for the family Tritoniidae is provided. A new genus among tritoniid taxa is proposed. Importance of the ontogeny-based taxonomy is highlighted. The cases when apomorphic characters considerably modified in a crown group due to the paedomorphosis are revealed. Tracing of the character evolution is presented for secondary gills–a key external feature of the family Tritoniidae and traditional dendronotacean nudibranchs.","Korshunova, T.; Martynov, A.",WOS:000595653500022,"Korshunova, Tatiana, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0242103,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Tochuina, ""Tritonia""",,,,Journal article,,,"Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Zool Museum, Moscow, Russia.",Russia,,SPECIES MOLLUSCA; GILL CAVITY; OPISTHOBRANCHIA; HETEROBRANCHIA; GENUS; REDESCRIPTION; CLADOBRANCHIA; CHARCOTIIDAE; MORPHOLOGY; CALIFORNIA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Lomonosov Moscow State University,x,Russia,,University,Science

Here, we identify research priorities by critically reviewing pre-clinical and clinical studies using extracts and compounds derived from molluscs, as well as traditional molluscan medicines, used in the treatment of respiratory diseases. We reviewed 97 biomedical articles demonstrating the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties of >320 molluscan extracts/compounds with direct relevance to respiratory disease, in addition to others with promising bioactivities yet to be tested in the respiratory context. Of pertinent interest are compounds demonstrating biofilm inhibition/disruption and antiviral activity, as well as synergism with approved antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic agents. At least 100 traditional medicines, incorporating over 300 different mollusc species, have been used to treat respiratory-related illness in cultures worldwide for thousands of years. These medicines provide useful clues for the discovery of bioactive components that likely underpin their continued use. There is particular incentive for investigations into anti-inflammatory compounds, given the extensive application of molluscan traditional medicines for symptoms of inflammation, and shells, which are the principal molluscan product used in these preparations. Overall, there is a need to target research toward specific respiratory disease-related hypotheses, purify bioactive compounds and elucidate their chemical structures, and develop an evidence base for the integration of quality-controlled traditional medicines.","Summer, K.; Browne, J.; Liu, L.; Benkendorff, K.",WOS:000593193600001,"Benkendorff, Kirsten, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/md18110570,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,marine natural products; ethnomedicine; coronavirus; hemocyanin; Mollusca; pulmonary; lung,Journal article,,,"Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, 2 Bay Dr, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia.",Australia,marine natural products; ethnomedicine; coronavirus; hemocyanin; Mollusca; pulmonary; lung,KEYHOLE LIMPET HEMOCYANIN; PRIMARY IMMUNE-RESPONSE; OUTER-MEMBRANE PROTEIN; NONTYPABLE HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA INFECTION; PEPTIDES REPRESENTING EPITOPES; FUNCTIONAL FOOD INGREDIENTS; RICH ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE; POSTERIOR SALIVARY-GLAND; TYRIAN PURPLE PRECURSORS,"Chemistry, Medicinal; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Southern Cross University,,Australia,,University,Science

The characteristics of the phytoplankton community in the CCW showed various community structures related to the nutrients supplied from the large rivers of the Chinese continent. However, the TWC had simple community structures because it originated near the equator and moved northward. The standing crops of phytoplankton and ciliates were very high in the CCW but showed low at the TWC. In particular, from the higher standing crops of protozoa than plant plankton at the TWC, the energy flow at the lower tropic levels caused by the microbial loop that fed on heterotrophic bacteria played an important role in the production of resource organisms.

To address this issue, we assembled a comprehensive species distribution data set of coral reef fishes from the 23 major locations of coral reefs in the coastal waters of Vietnam.

However, “rare” in this context has not been clearly defined. In an attempt to provide more insight into the concept of rarity in sea slug assemblages, we analysed abundance data from 209 individual surveys conducted over a 5-year period in a subtropical estuary and a 7-year period on a shallow coastal reef, on the Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia. Using an ‘intuitive’ method (<10 individuals recorded over the study), and the ‘quartile’ method we assessed numerical rarity (number of individuals of a species seen over the study period) and temporal rarity (frequency of observation). We also assessed numerical rarity using octaves based on log2 abundance bins. The quartile method did not effectively capture either measure of rarity. The octave method, however, fitted closely to subjective classifications of abundance and defined a similar number of species as rare when compared to the intuitive method. Using the octave method, 66% of species in both the estuary and on the reef, were considered as rare. Consequently, we recommend the octave method to allocate abundance classifications. To address the poor fit for temporal classifications based on quartiles, we propose the following as a working model for wider testing: rare ≤25% of surveys; uncommon 26−50%, common 51−75%; and abundant >75%.","Schubert, J.; Smith, S.D.A.",WOS:000593663200001,"Schubert, Julie, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d12110423,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,sea slugs; rarity; abundance; ephemeral; estuary; coastal reef,Journal article,,,"Southern Cross Univ, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Lismore, NSW 2458, Australia.",Australia,sea slugs; rarity; abundance; ephemeral; estuary; coastal reef,RARITY; MOLLUSCA; ASSEMBLAGES; GASTROPODS; COMMUNITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Southern Cross University - School of Environment, Science and Engineering - Marine Ecology Research Centre (MERC)",x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

Marine flora and fauna are tremendously valuable oceanic resources, which contribute to the major part of the oceanic biomass. They are taxonomically diverse, biologically potent, productive, and chemically inimitable in nature. The marine flora contain medicinally useful metabolites in abundance that include polyphenols, alkaloids, and sulfated polysaccharides. It has shown great role in pharmacological properties against cancer, microbial pathogenesis, malaria, viral diseases, inflammation, and diabetes. The phytochemicals possibly activate macrophages, reduce oxidative stress and thus help in immunomodulation. Though marine niche has rich phytochemical diversity, yet it is considered majorly untapped or unexplored. Therefore, a vast number of new biomolecules such as enzymes, polymers, and osmolytes from the marine biotic community are being studied, and there is a growing interest in the industrial production of biomimetics and combinatorial synthesis of naturally occurring marine bioactive principles and their derivatives.

Consequently, pharmaceutical industries are constantly in the search for new and advanced resources to produce safe and functional drugs to combat these challenges. Marine biosphere is one of the largest and intricate biospheres as water covers more than 70% of the earth inhabiting a number of flora and fauna. In the hostile marine environment, as part of their adaptation mechanisms, organisms produce specific secondary metabolites to survive in the ocean. These metabolites have very high biological activity and are explored for their potential therapeutic application. To date, seven marine-derived drugs have been approved as “first-in-class drugs” and several are in the clinical and pre-clinical pipeline. These drugs are successfully used in the market for the treatment of cancer, viral diseases, chronic pain, and to lower blood triglyceride levels.

In response, studies often develop custom reference databases to improve species assignment. The disadvantage of this approach is that it limits the potential for database re-use, and the transferability of inferences across studies. Here, we present the MARine Eukaryote Species (MARES) reference database for use in marine metabarcoding studies, created using a transparent and reproducible pipeline. MARES includes all COI sequences available in GenBank and BOLD for marine taxa, unified into a single taxonomy. Our pipeline facilitates the curation of sequences, synonymization of taxonomic identifiers used by different repositories, and formatting these data for use in taxonomic assignment tools.

Few specimens were insinuating or excavating. Furthermore, qualitative sampling was performed on Ustica’s coralligenous formations, photophilous hard substrates and in marine caves, and the results obtained were added to the literature data. The overall checklist of sponges from Ustica encompassed 97 taxa, 90 named at species level, subdivided into 6 taxa of Calcarea, 3 of Homoscleromorpha and 88 of Demospongiae. Eleven of the species were endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, mainly concentrated on rhodoliths and in marine caves. This research adds a fundamental element to the knowledge of invertebrates associated with rhodoliths, and updates the checklist of sponges colonizing Ustica’s waters, facilitating its future monitoring.","Longo, C.; Corriero, G.; Cardone, F.; Mercurio, M.; Pierri, C.; Nonnis-Marzano, C.",WOS:000600442300008,"Corriero, Giuseppe, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3989/scimar.04991.29a,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Porifera,,,"Porifera, Ustica Island, Mediterranean Sea, rhodolith beds, coralligenous formations, photophilous hard substrates, marine caves",Journal article,,,"Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Biol, Via Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",Italy,Porifera; Ustica Island; Mediterranean Sea; rhodolith beds; coralligenous formations; photophilous hard substrates; marine caves,DIVERSITY; PORIFERA; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; COMMUNITY; SHELF,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Bari Aldo Moro,,Italy,,University,Science

SCHPs-F1 also ameliorated the CTX-mediated structural disorders of the hepatic tissue. Western blot results suggested that SCHPs-F1 significantly restored the levels of endogenous antioxidants (CAT, T-AOC, GSH-Px, SOD and MDA levels) through activating the Nrf2 signal by upregulating the expression of GCLM, HO-1, and NQO-1. Moreover, SCHPs-F1 improved the CTX-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting of NF-κB signal responses and down-regulating the expression of the inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α). These findings suggest that SCHPs-F1 can regulate Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways and reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation in CTX-induced hepatotoxicity.

A total of 309 parasites infecting 164 cephalopods were found. We hypothesize that this diversity counts for less than half the potential parasite richness in this molluscan taxon. Taxonomic breadth of parasites was significantly above expectations from null models for Mediterranean Sea and NE Atlantic Ocean, whereas the opposite occurred for NW Pacific Ocean, where a few closely related genera characterized the parasite pool. β-diversity of parasites was very high and dominated by turnover, except for the Atlantic Ocean where a nested pattern among sub-basins emerged. Taxonomic relatedness of parasite species remained substantially unchanged through time, but species replacements largely occurred over the last two centuries. Our findings highlighted potential hotspots of taxonomic distinctness in cephalopod parasites, geographic regions deserving future research, and the need for a deeper understanding of the magnitude of marine parasite diversity, their biogeography, and their role in marine ecosystems.

In benthic ecosystems in the deep-sea, octocorals are some of the most abundant luminous animals. Among luminous sessile organisms, the shallow-water sea pansy <i>Renilla</i> has been well studied for its chemistry and molecular biology. Aside from <i>Renilla</i>, however, little is known about the bioluminescent mechanisms of other anthozoans, especially deep-sea corals. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of bioluminescence in deep-sea anthozoans. The bioluminescent capabilities of <i>Heteropolypus</i>, <i>Kophobelemnon</i>, <i>Paragorgia</i>, and a hormathiid anemone are newly described. Coelenterazine, a substrate for bioluminescent reactions, was detected in extracts from octocorals. Coelenterazine-dependent luciferase activity was found in all the anthozoans. Moreover, immunoreactivity against <i>Renilla</i> luciferase was detected in protein extracts from the families Isididae, Alcyoniidae, Umbellulidae, Funiculinidae, Kophobelemnidae and Protoptilidae, suggesting that all luminous octocorals may share a common biochemical mechanism, which utilizes coelenterazine and <i>Renilla</i>-type luciferase. Our results support the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of all the octocorals was bioluminescent, and that bioluminescence evolved a minimum of six times in Cnidaria. Future studies with robust phylogenies, wide taxon sampling, and comparative transcriptome analyses could reveal the patterns of evolution of bioluminescence in octocorals and anthozoans.

However, there is still little experimental evidence linking individual energetics and space‐use behaviour. Individual energy requirements scale mainly with body size and temperature, but these do not explain all individual variation. Therefore, studies focused on inter individual variation in resource and space use behaviour can be used to frame foraging dynamics in an energy perspective. We empirically tested the hypothesis of a relationship between individual energetics and patch departure behaviour using as model organisms four small species (body mass ranging from 0.4 to 14 mg AFDW) of aquatic gastropods strongly differing in adult size: <i>Galba truncatula</i>, <i>Bithynia tentaculata</i>, <i>Theodoxus fluviatilis</i> and <i>Ecrobia ventrosa</i> (in descending order of size). Motility tests were performed in controlled microcosm conditions. The tests were designed to classify the specimens as either low motility (not inclined to abandon the patch) or high motility (likely to abandon the patch). The tests entailed measuring the propensity of the individuals to abandon a limited resource patch (2 g DW of conditioned <i>Phragmites australis</i> leaves) within a given amount of time (24 h) when foraging with conspecifics under conditions where competition for food is expected to increase over time due to resource depletion. The individual standard metabolic rate of the tested specimens was measured via open flow respirometry and compared across motility classes at intra‐ and interspecific level. At both levels, we observed that individuals with higher standard metabolic rates were more inclined to abandon the patch. This finding establishes a link between foraging theory and competitive coexistence mechanisms.","Cozzoli, F.; Shokri, M.; Ligetta, G.; Ciotti, M.; Gjoni, V.; Marrocco, V.; Vignes, F.; Basset, A.",WOS:000555318300001,"Marrocco, Vanessa, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/oik.07378,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Salento, Ecol Lab, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, IT-73100 Lecce, Italy.",Italy,body mass; foraging; gastropods; metabolism; patch departure behaviour,CROSS-COMMUNITY APPROACH; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; BODY-SIZE; HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; FEEDING STRATEGIES; PREY DENSITY; COEXISTENCE,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Salento,x,Italy,,University,Science

For this purpose, sediment samples from in the inner of the Guanabara Bay (GB) were collected and analyzed (grain-size, mineralogy, geochemistry and living foraminifera). In this study, it is hypothesized that the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) concentrations, in solution and associated with organic matter (<sub>OM</sub>PTEs, potential nutrient source), may represent two potential pathways to impact benthic foraminifers. A multiproxy approach applied to complex statistical analyses and ecological indexes shows that the study area is, in general, eutrophic (with high organic matter and low oxygen content), polluted by PTEs and oil. As a consequence, foraminifera are not abundant and their assemblages are poorly diversified and dominated by some stress-tolerant species (i.e., <em>Ammonia tepida</em>, <em>Quinqueloculina seminula</em>, <em>Cribroelphidium excavatum</em>). The results allow us to identify a set of species sensitive to eutrophication and <sub>OM</sub>PTEs. Factors such as the increase of organic matter contents and <sub>OM</sub>PTEs and, in particular of Zn, Cd and Pb, the oxygen depletion and the presence of oil, altogether contribute to a marked reduction in the abundance and diversity of foraminifera. <em>Ammonia</em>-<em>Elphidium</em> Index and the Foram Stress Index confirm that the NE zone of GB is, in general, “heavily polluted”, with “poor ecological quality status” and experiences suboxic to anoxic conditions.

Despite considerable research on their parasites, no reliable estimates of their parasite diversity on a large geographical scale are available. In the present review, we analyse species richness of two parasitic flatworm groups (monogeneans and tapeworms) reported from cypriniform fishes in the two most intensively studied parts of the Holarctic region, Europe and North America. We also review knowledge on parasite speciation and host-parasite coevolution, and emphasise the risk of parasite co-introduction resulting from transfers of cypriniforms among different continents. As parasite diversity in European cypriniforms has been more intensively explored, we predicted a lower level of knowledge on parasite diversity in North American fishes, despite North America having a higher diversity of cypriniforms than Europe. Our data revealed a higher mean species richness of monogeneans and tapeworms per cypriniform species in Europe compared with North America. We showed that species richness of both parasite taxa in both continents is strongly affected by sample size, but that fish traits also play an important role in determining monogenean and tapeworm species richness in European cyprinoids. We recorded higher host specificity for cypriniform parasites in North America, even within parasite genera shared by cypriniforms on both continents. The host range of monogeneans parasitising cyprinoids on both continents was affected by phylogeny, indicating an effect of parasite life history on host specificity. The difference in parasite host range between the two continents could potentially be explained by either the low overall level of sampling activity in North America or an underestimation of parasite diversity in Europe. We suggest that future research efforts be focussed on cypriniforms in order to obtain reliable data for robust assessments of parasite species richness and phylogenies, to assess host-parasite coevolution and to reveal fish biogeography.","Kuchta, R.; Rehulková, E.; Francová, K.; Scholz, T.; Morand, S.; Simková, A.",WOS:000569152900006,"Kuchta, Roman, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.06.005,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Cestoda, ""Monogenea""",,,Parasite diversity; Cypriniform fish; Europe; North America; Monogenea; Cestoda,Journal article,,,"Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",Czech Republic,Parasite diversity; Cypriniform fish; Europe; North America; Monogenea; Cestoda,FRESH-WATER FISH; PARASITE SPECIES RICHNESS; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; HOST-SPECIFICITY; COMMON CARP; GYRODACTYLUS MONOGENEA; METAZOAN PARASITES; CYPRINUS-CARPIO; NORTH-AMERICA; BODY-SIZE,Parasitology,Parasitology,Masaryk University,x,Czech Republic,,University,Science

Decades of conotoxin research have provided numerous measurable scientific and societal benefits. These include their use as a drug, diagnostic agent, drug leads, and research tools in neuroscience, pharmacology, biochemistry, structural biology, and molecular evolution. Human envenomations by cone snails are rare but can be fatal. Death by envenomation is likely caused by a small set of toxins that induce muscle paralysis of the diaphragm, resulting in respiratory arrest. The potency of these toxins led to concerns regarding the potential development and use of conotoxins as biological weapons. To address this, various regulatory measures have been introduced that limit the use and access of conotoxins within the research community. Some of these regulations apply to all of the ≈200,000 conotoxins predicted to exist in nature of which less than 0.05% are estimated to have any significant toxicity in humans.

A way to assess the ecological consequences of species loss is by examining changes in functional diversity. The preservation of functional diversity depends on the range of ecological roles performed by species, or functional richness, and the number of species per role, or functional redundancy. However, current knowledge is based on short timescales and an understanding of how functional diversity responds to long-term biodiversity dynamics has been limited by the availability of deep-time, trait-based data. Here, we compile an exceptional trait dataset of fossil molluscs from a 23-million-year interval in the Caribbean Sea (34 011 records, 4422 species) and develop a novel Bayesian model of multi-trait-dependent diversification to reconstruct mollusc (i) diversity dynamics, (ii) changes in functional diversity, and (iii) extinction selectivity over the last 23 Myr. Our results identify high diversification between 23–5 Mya, leading to increases in both functional richness and redundancy. Conversely, over the last three million years, a period of high extinction rates resulted in the loss of 49% of species but only 3% of functional richness. Extinction rates were significantly higher in small, functionally redundant species suggesting that competition mediated the response of species to environmental change. Taken together, our results identify long-term diversification and selective extinction against redundant species that allowed functional diversity to grow over time, ultimately buffering the ecological functions of biological communities against extinction.","Pimiento, C.; Bacon, C.D.; Silvestro, D.; Hendy, A.; Jaramillo, C.; Zizka, A.; Meyer, X.; Antonelli, A.",WOS:000554927100016,"Bacon, Christine, C.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rspb.2020.1162,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Box 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Sweden,Caribbean; competition; extinction; global change; invertebrates; molluscs,ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ECOSPACE UTILIZATION; MARINE; DIVERSIFICATION; ISTHMUS; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; EMERGENCE; ECOLOGY; TRENDS,Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre,,Sweden,,University,Science

In the results, the water temperature ranged from 2.1℃ to 34.5℃, showing a large seasonal variation, but the salinity changed from 31.14 psu to 32.64 psu. Therefore, the seasonal variations of water types in GCW were mainly determined by water temperature. The phytoplankton community consisted of 53 genera and 86 species, showing a relatively simple distribution. The phytoplankton cell density ranged from 2.2 to 689.2 cells mL-1, with an average of 577.2 cells mL-1, which was low in autumn and high in winter. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton dominant species was mainly diatoms during the whole year, Leptocylindrus danicus, Chaetoceros curvisetus, Skeletonema costatum-ls in summer, Paralia sulcata, Eucampia zodiacus in autumn, S. costatum-ls, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii in winter, and S. costatum-ls, Asterionella glacialis in spring. In other words, the phytoplankton community showed high diversity in GCW throughout the year. According to the PCA, GCW were easily heated and cooled by radiant energy at lower depth, and the seasonal distributions of phytoplankton were determined by the supply of nutrients by re-fuelling of surface sediments due to the seawater mixing such as tidal mixing.","Yoon, Y.H.",,"Yoon, Yang, Y.H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5762/KAIS.2020.21.11.477,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,GCW; Marine Environments; T-S Diagram; Phytoplankton Community; Dominant Species; PCA; Seawater Mixing,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trawl bycatch consists of 45,527 ichthyofauna individuals collected fortnightly during the period June 2018 to April 2019. The recorded ichthyofaunal diversity includes 156 species belonging to 2 classes, 14 orders, 66 families, and 119 genera. The order Perciformes dominantes with 74 species (47%) followed by Scorpaeniformes (12%; 19 species) and Tetraodontiformes (11%; 18 species). Temporal diversity analysis revealed that the maximum species diversity was observed during the North-east monsoon (123 species) while the minimum was observed during the post-monsoon (107 species) period. Numerically dominant bycatch species were found to be <em>Leiognathus equulus</em> (6%), <em>Equulites lineolatus</em> (5%), <em>Gazza achlamys</em> (5%), <em>Karalla dussumieri</em>, (4%) <em>Otolithes ruber</em> (3%) and <em>Nibea maculata</em> (2%). Biodiversity analysis revealed that the Shannon–Wiener​ species diversity index ranged from 5.37 (South-west monsoon) to 5.53 (North-east monsoon) whereas the species evenness was observed from 0.77 (South-west monsoon) to 0.81 (Post-monsoon). The habitat-wise diversity analysis revealed that demersal species group was dominant (72 species; 46%) followed by reef-associated (70 species; 45%), benthopelagic (8 species; 5%), pelagic (5 species; 3%) and bathy-demersal (1 species; 1%). The results of the trophic level shows that the bycatch fish species was dominated by top-level carnivores (49%) followed by mid-level carnivores (26%), apex predator (19%), primary carnivores (5%) and herbivores or planktivores (1%). The IUCN categories of bycatch species are mostly classified as Not Evaluated, Least Concern, Data Deficient and Vulnerable viz., 58%, 36%, 5% and 1% respectively. The present study also gives information on juvenile fish that are encountered in trawl bycatch along the Chennai coast. The outcome of the study gives baseline information on the bycatch diversity which paves the way for the sustainable exploitation and also the management of exploited fisheries resources in this region.","Kodeeswaran, P.; Jayakumar, N.; Ranjith, L.",WOS:000603374600012,"Kodeeswaran, Paramasivam, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.101530,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Bottom trawling; Bycatch; Biodiversity indices; Trophic level,Journal article,,,"Dr MGR Fisheries Coll & Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resource Management, Ponneri 601204, Tamil Nadu, India.",India,Bottom trawling; Bycatch; Biodiversity indices; Trophic level,EAST-COAST; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; REEF FISHES; TRENDS; INDEX; CATCH,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Dr. MGR Fisheries College and Research Institute,,India,,University,Science

Thirty-seven historical datasets of these macrobenthic assemblages were re-analysed to assess variation of local patchiness in each of the 18 most common individual assemblage components at each of these localities in terms of three metrics: overall patchiness (Lloyd's index of patchiness), levels of unoccupancy, and variation in abundance across occupied samples (Lloyd's index of mean crowding). Within-site patchiness was not caused by a restriction of individual species to specific subareas but by variation in their local density, particularly by the extent of unoccupied ‘interstitial’ spaces within patches. Especially in the more uniform Queensland conditions, the more common species occurred relatively widely across the whole locality; individual samples from which a given species was absent never themselves formed patches, the number of such samples conforming to points on truncated normal curves of the frequency of occurrence. Of the 36 species investigated, the two most abundant and widespread both in Queensland and in South Africa displayed significant or near-significant uniformity of levels of local patchiness, whilst five showed significantly uniform mean crowding and ten significantly uniform unoccupancy. This is the first demonstration that some species may display a characteristic level of patchiness in a given habitat type.","Barnes, R.S.K.",WOS:000590043700002,"Barnes, R.S.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-020-03793-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England.",England,,SPATIAL STRUCTURE; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; ABUNDANCE; HETEROGENEITY; FRAGMENTATION; RECRUITMENT,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Cambridge,,UK,,University,Science

In the context of marine biodiversity conservation and management, this review outlines past, present and forward-looking perspectives on identifying and recording planktonic diversity by illustrating the transition from traditional species identification based on morphological diagnostic characters to full molecular genetic identification of marine assemblages. In this process, the article presents the methodological advancements by discussing progress and critical aspects of the crossover from traditional to novel and future molecular genetic identifications and it outlines the advantages of integrative approaches using the strengths of both morphological and molecular techniques to identify species and assemblages. We demonstrate this process of identifying and recording marine biodiversity on pelagic copepods as model taxon. Copepods are known for their high taxonomic and ecological diversity and comprise a huge variety of behaviours, forms and life histories, making them a highly interesting and well-studied group in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, their short life cycles and rapid responses to changing environments make them good indicators and core research components for ecosystem health and status in the light of environmental change.","Laakmann, S.; Blanco-Bercial, L.; Cornils, A.",WOS:000589653800003,"Blanco-Bercial, Leocadio, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rstb.2019.0446,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",Germany,identification; biodiversity; genetics; species; community; integrative approach,METAGENETIC COMMUNITY ANALYSIS; CALANOID COPEPODS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; PLANKTONIC COPEPODS; SEQUENCE VARIATION; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; ZOOPLANKTON; IDENTIFICATION; CRUSTACEA,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) - Department of Integrated Ecophysiology,x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

A relatively long lifespan and planktotrophic larval development are remarkable for such a small species, which reaches a maximum test length of 7.3 mm in the area, such traits being more typical of large-sized macrobenthic species.

This uniquely molluscan structure is formed in the blind end of the radular sac by specialized cells (membranoblasts and odontoblasts). Secretion type, and the number and shape of the odontoblasts that form each tooth characterize the mode of radula formation. These characteristics vary in different groups of gastropods. Elucidation of this diversity is key to identifying the main patterns of radula formation in Gastropoda. Of particular interest would be a phylogenetically closely related group that is characterized by high variability of the radula. One such group is the large monophyletic superfamily Conoidea, the radula of which is highly variable and may consist of the radular membrane with five teeth per row, or the radular membrane with only two or three teeth per row, or even just two harpoon‐like teeth per row without a radular membrane. We studied the radulae of two species of Conoidea (<i>Clavus maestratii</i> Kilburn, Fedosov &amp; Kantor, 2014 [Drilliidae] and, <i>Lophiotoma acuta</i> (Perry, 1811) [Turridae]) using light and electron microscopy. Based on these data and previous studies, we identify the general patterns of the radula formation for all Conoidea: the dorsolateral position of two groups of odontoblasts, uniform size, and shape of odontoblasts, folding of the radula in the radular sac regardless of the radula configuration. The morphology of the subradular epithelium is most likely adaptive to the radula type.","Vortsepneva, E.; Herbert, D.G.; Kantor, Y.",WOS:000563881800001,"Kantor, Yuri, Y.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/jmor.21250,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Biol Fac, Invertebrate Zool Dept, Leninskie Gory 1-12, Moscow 119234, Russia.",Russia,membranoblasts; odontoblasts; tooth formation; tooth use; ultrastructure,EVOLUTION; NEOGASTROPODA; APPARATUS; RENEWAL; TEETH,Anatomy & Morphology,Anatomy & Morphology,Lomonosov Moscow State University - Department of Invertebrate Zoology,x,Russia,,University,Science

Sea stars (Asteroidea) are a diversified and abundant component of benthic ecosystems in the SO, in which they can play key ecological roles. Former studies suggest that the diversity of the entire class is still poorly known and underestimated, hampering the assessment of the origin and evolution of the class in the SO. In the present study, we analyse spatial patterns of SO sea star diversity using an occurrence database of ~14,000 entries. The biogeographic analysis is coupled with the exploration of an extensive molecular phylogeny based on over 4,400 specimen sequences to inform, support and/or question the observed diversity patterns. We show that the current taxonomy of SO asteroids needs revision and that their diversity has generally been overlooked and misinterpreted. Molecular results highlight the recent diversification of most studied taxa, at genus and species levels, which supports an evolutionary scenario referring to successive invasion and exchange events between the SO and adjacent regions, and clade diversification during periods of rapid environmental changes driven by the succession of glacial cycles.

Among its predators, we investigated an abundant unarmored dinoflagellate (~3000 cells per liter) in the North Sea in May 2019. It has been reported in the literature as <em>Gymnodinium heterostriatum </em>or <em>G. striatissimum</em>, and often identified as <em>Gyrodinium spirale</em>. Phylogenetic analyses using the small-, large subunit- and Internal Transcriber Spacers of the ribosomal RNA (SSU-, LSU-, ITS rRNA) gene sequences indicate that our isolates clustered within the <em>Gyrodinium </em>clade. The new sequences formed a sister group with sequences of the freshwater taxon <em>Gyrodinium helveticum</em>, being one of the infrequent marine-freshwater transitions in the microbial world. This isolate is the first characterized member of a clade of numerous environmental sequences widely distributed from cold to tropical seas. This common and abundant taxon has received several names due to its morphological plasticity (changes of size and shape, often deformed after engulfing prey) and the difficulty in discerning surface striation. We conclude that the priority is for the species name <em>Gymnodinium heterostriatum </em>Kofoid & Swezy 1921, a new name that was proposed for <em>Gymnodinium spirale </em>var. <em>obtusum </em>sensu Dogiel 1906.

Paraguay is a landlocked, tropical country, which still holds enormous forested areas despite intense degradation. The country shows enormous potential algal biodiversity. We searched published records of algal species within Paraguay, checked their taxonomic status, and provided their locations, resulting in a thorough list of the algae known to date in Paraguay. Only 33 articles were published between 1897 and 2020. From the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and until the late 1970s, there were few publications on algae, and most studies were conducted within the last 7&nbsp;years. We compiled records of 893 species from 54 orders and 10 phyla. Only freshwater algal records were found; none were terrestrial or from brackish lagoons. Most species belong to Charophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. The Lower Paraguay basin showed the highest number of records, i.e. 564 species, 309 not found in any other basin in Paraguay. The highest number of algal records are from the Humid Chaco ecoregion, with 610 species, 343 of which did not occur in any other ecoregion of the country. Our results indicate that Paraguay requires extensive research and human resource training programs in phycology. Because of its threatened status, we consider the Dry Chaco to be the most important area where research should be intensified.","Rosset, V.K.; Bartozek, E.C.R.; Lambrecht, R.W.; Auricchio, M.R.; Dos Santos, M.; Peres, C.K.",WOS:000586047300001,"Rosset, Vitória, V.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/00318884.2020.1830597,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Freshwater algae; Gran Chaco; Neotropical algae; Phycology,Journal article,,,"Fed Univ Latin Amer Integrat UNILA, Lab Limnol, Foz Do Iguacu, Brazil.",Brazil,Freshwater algae; Gran Chaco; Neotropical algae; Phycology,SHORTFALLS; SCALE,Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Federal University for Latin American Integration (UNILA),,,,,

Helminth infections in fish have a major impact on public health and sustainable fish production. A comprehensive summary of the recent knowledge on fish helminths is important to understand the distribution of parasites in the country, and to design effective control measures. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted, collecting available literature published between January 2004 and October 2020. A total of 108 eligible records were retrieved reporting 268 helminth species, among which are digeneans, monogeneans, cestodes, nematodes and acanthocephalans. Some helminths were identified with zoonotic potential, such as, the heterophyids, opisthorchiids, the nematodes <em>Gnathostoma spinigerum</em>, <em>Anisakis</em> sp. and <em>Capillaria</em> spp. and the cestode <em>Hysterothylacium</em>; and with highly pathogenic potential, such as, the monogeneans of Capsalidae, Diplectanidae and Gyrodactylidae, the nematodes <em>Philometra</em> and Camallanidae, the tapeworm <em>Schyzocotyle acheilognathi,</em> the acanthocephalans <em>Neoechinorhynchus</em> and <em>Acanthocephalus.</em> Overall, these studies only covered about nine percent of the more than 2400 fish species occurring in the waters of Vietnam. Considering the expansion of the aquaculture sector as a part of the national economic development strategy, it is important to expand the research to cover the helminth fauna of all fish species, to assess their potential zoonotic and fish health impacts.","Nguyen, T.H.; Dorny, P.; Nguyen, T.T.G.; Dermauw, V.",WOS:000642219700003,"Nguyen, Trang, T.H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.12.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pisces,,,Systematic review; Helminths; Fish; Occurrence; Vietnam,Journal article,,,"Inst Trop Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Natl Str 155, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Belgium,Systematic review; Helminths; Fish; Occurrence; Vietnam,BORNE ZOONOTIC TREMATODES; FRESH-WATER FISH; NEOECHINORHYNCHUS ACANTHOCEPHALA NEOECHINORHYNCHIDAE; CATFISH PANGASIANODON-HYPOPHTHALMUS; EPINEPHELUS-COIOIDES HAMILTON; COLOSSOMA-MACROPOMUM CUVIER; GOURAMI OSPHRONEMUS-GORAMY; NAM DINH PROVINCE; MEKONG DELTA; CENTROCESTUS-FORMOSANUS,Ecology; Parasitology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Parasitology,Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Following earlier work on the intertidal seagrass <em>Zostera capensis</em> in South Africa, interspecific macrofaunal patchiness-occupancy and patchiness-abundance relationships were investigated within each of a number of other seagrass systems (intertidal <em>Cymodocea serratula</em>, <em>Halodule uninervis</em>, <em>Halophila ovalis</em>, <em>Zostera muelleri</em> and <em>Z. noltei</em>, and subtidal <em>Z. capensis</em>) where faunal assemblages were markedly different in their overall abundance and species richness, and where the beds differed in their latitude, longitude, and other variables, including one in an artificial canal in a residential marina. Notwithstanding these differences, in all cases the more abundant and widespread the macrobenthic species, the less was its Lloyd's <em>I</em><sub>p</sub> patchiness, the more clearly so in respect of occupancy than of abundance. Correlation of <em>I</em><sub>p</sub> and mean crowding (<em>I</em><sub>c</sub>) values was relatively poor, and often not significant. This suggests that patchiness of a species is more influenced by unoccupancy levels than by even marked variation in abundance at occupied sites (e.g. <em>I</em><sub>c</sub> values of &lt;0.3–&gt;380). Indeed, values of <em>I</em><sub>p</sub> were closely correlated with the expression [<em>a</em>.unoccupancy&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1−<em>a</em>).<em>I</em><sub>c</sub>], where <em>a</em> is &gt;0.80. In all cases, component macrofaunal species displayed a significant or near significant negative patchiness-occupancy relationship in the form of a power-law with a mean scaling coefficient across sites of −0.76, although data points appeared highly scattered.

France, a major actor for marine conservation with the second largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, with territories in all Ocean basins but the Arctic, aims at reaching the 30% by 2022, for which one third shall include a strong protection status. However, the strategy to reach this twofold target faces two challenges. First, while some standards exist to classify the levels of protection, France is currently using a case specific, loose approach to define strong protection. Second, there is no criteria that addresses the representativeness of the protection across French Ocean basins. Here, we assess the protection levels of the 524 French MPAs and their distribution across territories and habitats. While 33.7% of France’s waters are covered by an MPA, 12.5% of these areas do not impose regulations stronger inside than outside. Full and high levels of protection, the most effective for biodiversity conservation, represent only 1.6% of French waters and are unevenly distributed across Ocean basins and habitats, with 80.5% concentrated in a single territory. To fill this gap in protection for the second largest exclusive economic zone in the world, it is critical that France’s high ambition is both qualitatively and quantitatively deployed in each Ocean basin to protect our Ocean, its biodiversity and to sustain the livelihood of millions of people.","Claudet, J.; Loiseau, C.; Pebayle, A.",WOS:000609164600011,"Pebayle, Antoine, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104379,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Conservation; UN sustainable development goals; Convention on biological diversity; Europe and overseas territories; Marine policy,Journal article,,,"PSL Univ Paris, Natl Ctr Sci Res, CRIOBE, USR 3278 CNRS EPHE UPVD,Maison Oceans, 195 Rue St Jacques, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,Conservation; UN sustainable development goals; Convention on biological diversity; Europe and overseas territories; Marine policy,TAKE MARINE RESERVES; CONSERVATION OUTCOMES; AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; OCEAN; DRIVERS; SCIENCE,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,PSL Research University,,France,,University,Science

The successful implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management requires an understanding of predator-prey relationships and ways to operationalize such relationships to inform fisheries management. Here, we investigated if the diet of a generalist predator, Atlantic puffin <i>Fratercula arctica</i>, can be used as an indicator of the abundance of 2 commercially exploited prey species (haddock <i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i> and Acadian redfish <i>Sebastes fasciatus</i>) in the Gulf of Maine. Because haddock and redfish eaten by puffins are juveniles (age 0), there is potential to use their proportions and lengths in puffin diet to better understand the processes influencing haddock and redfish recruitment. By using principal component analysis to develop measures of diet across multiple puffin colonies, we show both spatial variation and large-scale patterns in the proportions and lengths of haddock and redfish in puffin diet. Spawning stock biomass was a strong predictor of haddock proportion in puffin diet and a moderate predictor of redfish proportion; however, proportions in puffin diet did not predict age-1 recruitment, suggesting that variation in recruitment is caused by processes that occur after the puffin breeding season and which affect the survival of older juveniles. Haddock length on one colony was a moderate predictor of age-1 recruitment. We conclude that puffin diet can be used as an indicator of haddock and redfish abundance.","Depot, K.M.; Kress, S.W.; Shannon, P.; Diamond, A.W.; Elliott, K.H.",WOS:000621252600006,"Depot, Katelyn, K.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps13537,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,"Fratercula arctica, ""Melanogrammus aeglefinus"", ""Sebastes fasciatus""",,,Seabirds · Indicators · Forage fish · Ecosystem-based fisheries management · Diet · Recruitment · Spawning stock biomass · Principal component analysis,Journal article,,,"McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",Canada,Seabirds; Indicators; Forage fish; Ecosystem-based fisheries management; Diet; Recruitment; Spawning stock biomass; Principal component analysis,MELANOGRAMMUS-AEGLEFINUS; FORAGE FISH; GEORGES-BANK; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; ACADIAN REDFISH; SEABIRDS; SEBASTES; INDICATORS; GROWTH; RECRUITMENT,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,McGill University,,Canada,,University,Science

Scientific names were consolidated under currently accepted nomenclature based on the World Register of Marine Species. Further revision of species names was made by referring to monographs on temperate coral species of Japan, along with expert knowledge. The dataset includes the coral species recorded each year at each study site, the geographical location of each site, and the scientific names of the corals. Three supporting datasets were created, containing a list of literature, the names of the sites and synonymization and confirmation of the coral names.

Considering the spatial and temporal limitations of direct instrumental measurements, proxy data extracted from marine environmental archives are necessary to separate anthropogenic changes from those that would occur naturally. The majority of late-Holocene, high resolution environmental reconstructions are derived from marine carbonates including tropical scleractinian corals, bivalves, crustose coralline algae, and sclerosponges. However, these archives are restricted to the top hundreds of meters of the water column, and only preserve environmental variability that is captured by calcium carbonate skeletons. At a very few select locations, marine sediments archive annual environmental variability in organic and inorganic materials. Recently, additional types of corals are proving to yield information complimentary to these traditional marine archives, including cold water scleractinian corals and proteinaceous corals. A taxonomically-diverse group, the proteinaceous corals are broadly defined as those having a branching gross-morphology with skeleton comprised at least partly of protein-rich organic material. They encode characteristics of their food and ambient environment into the chemical and physical composition of their skeleton. This environmental-encoding combined with their banded skeleton and significant longevity means that proteinaceous corals hold information in their skeleton that helps fill the spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge of past and present ocean conditions.    Here I review the environmental reconstructions derived from geochemical measurements of the proteinaceous coral skeletons. This information is grouped into the mesopelagic environmental variability captured in the skeleton of bamboo corals, surface processes captured in the organic skeletons of corals across all ocean depths, and environmental variability documented by skeletal radiometric isotopes. We include animals from two separate subclasses within the class Anthozoa, including the parasitic Zoanthids that secrete a sclero-proteic skeleton. Since the proteinaceous corals are taxonomically diverse, we consider the unique features that define this group of corals including their distribution, morphology, nutrition, and longevity. We find that uncertainty surrounding biological parameters limits the precision of reconstructions derived from the calcitic skeleton; in contrast, analytical effort and cost constrain the number of reconstructions from the organic skeleton. Through this discussion, we provide insights into the uses, challenges, and directions for future research for this important environmental archive.","Williams, B.",WOS:000575842100002,"Williams, Branwen, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103326,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Corals; Paleo-environmental proxy archives; Organic skeleton; Calcite; Stable isotope geochemistry; Trace element composition; Radiometric dating,Journal article,,,"Scripps Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",USA,Corals; Paleo-environmental proxy archives; Organic skeleton; Calcite; Stable isotope geochemistry; Trace element composition; Radiometric dating,DEEP-SEA CORALS; MAGNESIUM CARBONATE CONCENTRATIONS; HIGH-RESOLUTION PALEOCLIMATOLOGY; NITROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; RADIOCARBON-BASED AGES; AMINO-ACID DELTA-C-13; NORTH PACIFIC-OCEAN; COLD-WATER CORALS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; EL-NINO EVENTS,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,"University of California, San Diego (UCSD) - Scripps Institution of Oceanography",,USA,,Research institute,Science

Their diversity and distribution reflect local hydrological settings especially well, thus allowing the development of biotic indices for studying climate-mediated changes in the world’s oceans. The effects of global warming are most pronounced in the Arctic Ocean and have been further accelerated by the strengthening inflow of relatively warm Atlantic waters (AtW) <em>via</em> the Fram Strait, referred to as Atlantification. Here, we use the GZ distribution to describe the current state of Atlantic water inflow into the Arctic Ocean and to discuss the future of this fragile ecosystem. For this purpose, we characterized the abundance, diversity, and demography of the GZ identified from vertically stratified samples (down to 1000&nbsp;m) collected in the Fram Strait along two latitudinally parallel transects of varying influence of AtW. Overall, we identified 17 taxa, with <em>Aglantha digitale</em>, <em>Dimophyes arctica</em> and <em>Mertensia ovum</em> being the most abundant. We then contrasted our jellyfish and ctenophore data with both biotic and environmental ecosystem characteristics and analysed the associations between the GZ community and water mass distribution. We showed that the more abundant GZ community was found along the southern transect; that the sampling depth and bathymetric zone played the most important roles in structuring the GZ diversity; that water mass distribution affected GZ demography; and that AtW was dominated by <em>A. digitale</em>, that constituted 66% of the total GZ abundance. Our results, although temporarily limited, suggest that the Atlantification will promote the expansion of boreal species into the Arctic, and could lead to a less diverse, but more abundant GZ community in the future. In addition, we compare in detail the GZ community found in different water masses, at different depths, and in different bathymetric zones, and supported with literature data, discuss the future of the European Arctic under the scenario of increasing inflow of Atlantic water.","Manko, M.K.; Gluchowska, M.; Weydmann-Zwolicka, A.",WOS:000600863100007,"Manko, Maciej, M.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102414,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Ctenophora,,,Jellyfish; Ctenophores; Atlantification; Climate change; Arctic,Journal article,,,"Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Dept Marine Plankton Res, Pilsudskiego Av 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland.",Poland,Jellyfish; Ctenophores; Atlantification; Climate change; Arctic,EASTERN BERING-SEA; POTENTIAL PREDATORY IMPACT; IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; PELAGIC CNIDARIANS; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; JELLYFISH BLOOMS; COASTAL WATERS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Gdansk - Institute of Oceanography,x,Poland,,Research institute,Science

Total of 470 individual of knout goby was collected and it was previously reported that knout goby shows negative (-) allometry though within this study it was found that it only shows negative (-) allometry in spring and positive (+) allometry in other seasons. The diet was composed of crustaceans, teleost fishes and gastropods. According to the relative importance analysis, teleost fishes are the main food item for all and male individuals but for female crustaceans are the main food item. Trophic level results show that for all individuals trophic levels is 4.34, and when sexes are compared females have higher trophic level than males. While both sexes only consume teleost during summer, in other seasons females prefer more crustacean in their diet compared to males. Niche breadth index results indicated that when all individuals diet was compared among seasons in winter the niche breadth was the broader and summer was the narrower, in case of females the broader was fall and for males it was winter.

The monthly variation in the gonad dry weights, gonadal stages and other quantitative reproductive variables (oocyte diameter, density and thickness of spermatogenic columns) indicated a clearly annual gametogenic cycle and revealed a high level of spawning synchrony. A main spawning event occurs between August and September, and a minor and asynchronous spawning event was recorded during the austral summer (January–March). The highest gonadal growth rate occurs between late spring and summer, accompanied by growth and early prematurity gonadal stages, indicating active vitellogenesis. The accumulation of ova begins in autumn and shows a peak during winter. After spawning, the recovery stages are not extended in time and ovaries do not show a complete meshwork of nutritive phagocytes within the acinus, suggesting simultaneous reabsorption and inversion processes. Spermatogenesis shows a higher maturation rate than oogenesis, and a higher temporal prevalence of premature and mature stages. Major spawning coincides with the first rise in seawater temperature, the maximum rate of increase in day length and the maximum peak of chlorophyll <i>a</i>. Results also revealed some temporal differences in the gonadal cycle, vitellogenesis and spawning periods compared with other <i>P. magellanicus</i> populations from different latitudes.

Despite increasing research effort in recent years many fundamental questions remain to be answered before we can effectively manage the issue. One question is whether the greater number of NIMS thus far documented in temperate waters is real or an artefact of fewer surveys being undertaken  in tropical environments. Another one is whether poor taxonomic knowledge of the biodiverse tropics hides NIMS that actually occur there. Extensive taxonomic work in three Pacific localities (Guam, northern Western Australia and Singapore) has been collated in previous papers showing that there are relatively few NIMS in these biodiverse environments. The present paper replicates investigations for a low latitude environment in southern Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. The focus area includes the extensive Florida Keys coral reef environment, the southern margin of the Everglades on Florida Bay and the major PortMiami. Only 48 NIMS were identified in a literature-based compilation of 4,615 species; 15 species were represented by isolated records and have not established populations, leaving only 33 NIMS that are established or whose status is unknown. Records for Mollusca, the group with the most species (1,153) in the compilation, were individually researched and taxonomically verified. It is argued that the relative paucity of NIMS is not a straightforward temperature-driven tropical/temperate issue, but instead there are biological factor(s) restricting the ability of NIMS to colonise biodiverse environments compared to less diverse areas.","Wells, F.E.; Bieler, R.",WOS:000566792800002,"Bieler, Rüdiger, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3391/mbi.2020.11.3.02,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,,,"introduced marine pests, biotic resistance, artificial reefs, Florida Keys, biodiversity databases, molluscs",Journal article,,,"Field Museum Nat Hist, Negaunee Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",USA,introduced marine pests; biotic resistance; artificial reefs; Florida Keys; biodiversity databases; molluscs,EVERGLADES-NATIONAL-PARK; INDO-PACIFIC LIONFISH; GULF-OF-MEXICO; CAULERPA-TAXIFOLIA; PERNA-VIRIDIS; GREEN MUSSEL; BISCAYNE BAY; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; PTEROIS-VOLITANS; WESTERN ATLANTIC,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH),x,USA,,Museum,Science

While these assemblages are well studied along continental margins, investigations from insular margin that surround oceanic islands are very limited. This paper examines the distribution and standing stock of macrozoobenthos at 50, 100, and 200 m depth contours surrounding the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the tropical Indian Ocean. The standing stock of macrozoobenthos decreased from the mesophotic reef areas (50 m depth) to the deeper strata (200 m), particularly in the case of the dominant groups, the polychaetes and crustaceans. Smaller-sized, interstitial polychaetes and crustaceans were abundant in the coarser sandy sediments at the shallower sites. The polychaetes were represented by 606 species (279 genera) in the study, of which &gt;50% were rare species. Based on polychaete species composition, three regions were delineated in the study area - the Nicobar margin, the western margin of the Andaman (Bay of Bengal sector), and the eastern margin of the Andaman (Andaman Sea sector). The long, uninterrupted Andaman Island chain formed a geographic barrier separating the eastern and western margins, resulting in the regional distinctions in sediment nature and hydrographic characteristics, which in turn influenced species distribution. Corresponding differences were absent in the case of the Nicobar Islands, which are widely separated by transecting channels, permitting exchange of water between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Within the three regions, polychaete communities changed significantly in taxonomic and functional composition with increasing depth. The well oxygenated, coarse sandy sediments around mesophotic reefs (50 m) harbored predator-dominated assemblages. The 200 m sites, which were characterized by oxygen minimum conditions (&lt;0.5 ml.l<sup>–1</sup>), particularly around the Andaman Island mass, were dominated by deposit feeders. This study provides the first comprehensive dataset on distribution and standing stock of macrozoobenthos, and community structure of polychaetes along the Andaman and Nicobar insular margin. It also revealed the highest number of polychaete species ever recorded in the northern Indian Ocean, indicating that the Andaman and Nicobar margin is a significant marine biodiversity hotspot.","Gopal, A.; Abdul Jaleel, K.U.; Parameswaran, U.V.; Sanjeevan, V.N.; Vijayan, A.; Saravanane, N.; Gupta, G.V.M.; Sudhakar, M.",WOS:000564673700001,"Sanjeevan, V.N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2020.00710,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Minist Earth Sci, Ctr Marine Living Resources & Ecol, Kochi, Kerala, India.",India,benthos; polychaetes; Andaman and Nicobar; mesophotic reefs; biodiversity; islands; benthic ecology,OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE; SIEVE MESH-SIZE; AYEYARWADY CONTINENTAL-SHELF; MACROBENTHIC COMMUNITY; ANDAMAN SEA; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,India government - Ministry of Earth Sciences - Centre for Marine Living Resources & Ecology (CMLRE),x,India,,Research institute,Science

Zoobenthic assemblages along shelf gradients occurred with habitat types and ecological status and then, bottom depths and depth-related sediment grain structure and content.

There is general agreement that the aberrations in recent populations of <em>Peneroplis</em> are natural and intraspecific. For these reasons, some authors have questioned the systematic relationships among living <em>Peneroplis</em> species. In this study, we explore variation in an exceptionally abundant population of <em>Peneroplis</em> from Pete's Pond, a permanent wetland, within the Lake Macleod Evaporate Basin, Western Australia. The area is unusual because foraminifera are isolated from the nearby ocean, except for a 15-km subterranean karst system that permits a constant delivery of seawater. Pete's Pond water salinities are either less than or at normal seawater levels. The morphological variations identified have been grouped, with morphogroups A, B, and C referred to as variants of the <em>Peneroplis</em> growth pattern, including morphotypes with high flaring and cylindrical uniserial chambers. Morphogroups D and E are referred to as ‘abnormal’ aberrant forms, which show bifurcated serial chambers or a disordered growing style. Variants are the most critical in terms of taxonomic discrimination. Here we recommend the following morphological constraints for species determination of <em>Peneroplis</em> variants: i) degree of involution of early chambers; ii) presence/absence of umbilical depressions, iii) incision of sutures and iv) ornament, including the presence and disposition of small pits or ribs. Aberration in <em>Peneroplis</em> is considered to be linked to strict environmental parameters that have led to optimum shell growth as well as to having a key role in the phylogenesis of Soritoidea through deep time.","Consorti, L.; Kavazos, C.R.J.; Ford, C.; Smith, M.; Haig, D.W.",WOS:000582087300013,"Consorti, Lorenzo, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2020.101919,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Peneroplis,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Trieste, Dept Math & Geosci, Via Weiss 2, I-34128 Trieste, Italy.",Italy,,BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; LARGER FORAMINIFERA; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; SESOKO ISLAND; LIFE-CYCLE; REEF; ASSEMBLAGES; SEDIMENTS; BAY; ENVIRONMENTS,Paleontology,Paleontology,University of Trieste,,Italy,,University,Science

This evident shift was indicated by Multidimensional Scaling at the Bray Curtis similarity level of 31%. Before 2010, the primary components of phytoplankton were Cyanobacteria (up to 98% of the biomass, October 2007) and Chlorophyta (40%, July 2002). After 2010, the contribution of Cyanobacteria considerably decreased, and the proportions of other phyla increased. The total phytoplankton biomass positively correlated with phosphorus, and Cyanobacteria biomass with silica. Evident changes were also observed in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton. Before 2010, the highest values of biomass occurred in autumn, and were related to high biomass of Cyanobacteria. Higher biomass has been recently reached in spring, during the dominance of Ochrophyta associated with Chlorophyta, Charophyta, and Cryptophyta. Generalised additive models showed a significant decreasing trend of the total phytoplankton biomass, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and flagellates, suggesting a decrease in eutrophication. This trend is concurrent with a considerable increase in the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass since 2010. The increased ratio, however, did not result from elevated zooplankton biomass, but from the drop in phytoplankton biomass. Therefore, the most probable reason for the decrease in phytoplankton biomass was the simultaneous decrease in the concentration of all nutrients. The potential additional impact of filtration by a new alien bivalve <em>Rangia cuneata</em> G. B.

Akin to developments in other subfields of ecology, the emergence of trait-based ecology has provided an integrative framework for assessing community response to environmental changes and predicting feedback to ecosystem processes. This chapter reviews a broad array of traits currently in use to describe metazooplankton in freshwater and marine environments, discussing their information value and estimation. The chapter examines known trait correlations and trade-offs, as well as variations in trait patterns among habitats, and also bring to light several aspects of trait-based studies on metazooplankton that have been underrepresented to date, including lesser studied traits, taxa or habitats. In addition to providing mechanistic insight into community composition and processes, the goal of trait-based approaches often relates to improving estimates of diversity through the calculation of functional diversity indices; a section of this chapter discusses the use of traits for functional diversity estimation in metazooplankton communities.

It requires excellent water quality to ensure its growth rate and production. Therefore, intensive culture system is considered. However, the system threatens the sustainability of the adjacent environment and thus proper water treatment is necessary to increase the quality of water used in shrimp farming as well as the wastewater it produces. In this study, we explored the use of a silvofishery system that integrates mangroves into a pond as a potential solution to this issue. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the silvofishery system at treating water inputs and effluents of a whiteleg shrimp pond in Probolinggo District, East Java, Indonesia. Eight physicochemical water quality parameters and a phytoplankton community at four sampling sites during neap tide period were examined in this study. The effectiveness of the silvofishery system in increasing water quality was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), while the diversity of phytoplankton for biomonitoring was measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’). The results showed that the mangrove effectively increased the quality of the water supply and wastewater in the intensive whiteleg shrimp pond-especially in terms of nutrient removal-as well as the biodiversity of its phytoplankton community<strong>. </strong>Other parameters such as TOM and ammonia also decreased, though this was not statistically proven.","Musa, M.; Lusiana, E.D.; Buwono, N.R.; Arsad, S.; Mahmudi, M.",,"Musa, Muhammad, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.13057/biodiv/d211031,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Litopenaeus vannamei,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We obtained curated and standardized data from online databases, legal documents, press releases, and websites. All data were standardized according to the taxonomic nomenclature described in the Catalogue of Life. We grouped data into five categories: 1) biological information, 2) conservation status, 3) management opportunities, 4) use, and 5) inclusion in international conventions and treaties. For species biological information, we included migration, habitat, species characteristics such as length & body weight, their threat to humans, life-history trait data availability from FishBase, whether the species was listed on the Global Register of Migratory Species, the presence of occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), information on genomics from GenBank, and species evolutionary distinctiveness scores. For conservation status, we recorded threat status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species™ and inclusion in the Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). For management opportunities, we identified species under human care in zoos and aquariums in the Species360 network, species under management in studbooks from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the American Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and the Zoo and Aquarium Association Australasia (ZAA), as well as data on recovery, management, and action plans at the class, family, and species levels. For use, we collated species-level data on international trade levels from the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Trade Database, as used in aquaculture, as bait, and as gamefish, recording the purpose of the trade according to the IUCN Red List and the global catches reported to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). Finally, we collated information from seven international conventions and treaties: CITES, UNCLOS (the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea), CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals), Shark MoU (the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks), BERN (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats), OSPAR (Protecting and conserving the North-East Atlantic and its resources), and the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean. Our data are comparable across databases and will assist further research on in-situ and ex-situ population management for sharks and batoids. Our data can be of use to international policy makers, aquarium curators, management authorities, conservation practitioners, and scientists interested in prioritizing Elasmobranchs for conservation.","Oegelund Nielsen, R.; da Silva, R.; Juergens, J.; Staerk, J.; Lindholm Sørensen, L.; Jackson, J.; Smeele, S.Q.; Conde, D.A.",WOS:000600652300016,"Oegelund Nielsen, Rikke, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106337,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Elasmobranchii,,,Aquatic management; CITES; Threatened species; International treaties; Life history traits; Captive husbandry; Aquariums; rays,Journal article,,,"Univ Southern Denmark, Interdisciplinary Ctr Populat Dynam, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",Denmark,Aquatic management; CITES; Threatened species; International treaties; Life history traits; Captive husbandry; Aquariums rays,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

Due to its direct link with energetic demands, growth also represents an important parameter to estimate energy and nutrient fluxes. For marine fishes, growth rate information is most frequently derived from sagittal otoliths, and most of the available data stems from studies on temperate species that are targeted by commercial fisheries. Although the analysis of otoliths is a powerful tool to estimate individual growth, the time-consuming nature of otolith processing is one barrier for collection of comprehensive datasets across multiple species. This is especially true for coral reef fishes, which are extremely diverse. Here, we provide back-calculated size-at-age estimates (including measures of uncertainty) based on sagittal otoliths from 710 individuals belonging to 45 coral reef fish species from French Polynesia.

This chapter discusses the wood-boring molluscan families Teredinidae, Pholadidae and Xylophagaidae and the crustacean families Limnoriidae, Sphaeromatidae and Cheluridae.    An introduction of each family is first provided which includes aspects of taxonomy and phylogeny grounded on molecular data and morphological features’ analyses. Elements of animals’ morphology and physiology are then examined. Their body plan, size, shape, segmentation, bearing appendages etc. are illustrated. Animals’ reproductive systems and fertilization modes in both dioecious and hermaphroditic taxa are presented and the life histories of oviparous or larviparous species are described. Behavioural features associated to populations’ growth, such as mating, parental care and migration tactics, to wood detection, such as chemoreception and mechanoreception and to wood settlement, such as phototaxis, thigmotaxis and geotaxis are also considered.    Marine borers’ distribution, habitat and niche are then explored with special reference to environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and depth and to the biota with which may have symbiotic relationships. Factors related to the wooden substrate, such as species, grain orientation, lignification, water content, preservatives’ treatment, presence of decaying fungi, which are influencing their colonizing behaviour, development and boring activity are also mentioned.    Finally, wood boring mechanisms and feeding habits are elucidated for seston feeders using wood solely as a shelter and for xylophagous borers utilizing it as a source of nourishment. Animals’ adaptations for settlement and boring are explored and decay patterns and burrows morphology are exemplified. Wood digestive mechanisms, employed by wood feeders are also discussed, along with the lignocellulose enzyme systems used, produced either endogenously or by symbiotic microorganisms harbouring animals’ digestive truck.","Pournou, A.",,"Pournou, Anastasia, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-46504-9_5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wood deteriogens such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, insects and marine borers, utilizing wooden Cultural Heritage as a source of nutrients or as a physical substrate for their development, are presented. Bacteria and archaea are first addressed and their taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships and main morphological types are examined. Similarly, the ambiguous systematics and taxonomy of fungi are shown via a 9-phylum classification. Filamentous fungi features such as hyphae, mycelium, reproductive units and fruit bodies are defined along with their sexual and asexual life cycle. Based on the micromorphology and patterns of wood decay, bacteria are classified into erosion, tunnelling and cavitation bacteria, whereas the dikaryotic wood-decaying fungi are categorized into white-, soft- and brown-rot fungi.    Marine wood borers, belonging to Mollusca and Crustacea are then recognized as major wood deteriogens encountered in marine ecosystems. Basics on their phylogeny, taxonomy morphological characters, physiology, feeding modes and life histories are presented. The molluscan bivalves attacking wooden Cultural Heritage are further mentioned and description of their body, reproduction modes, along with growth stages from the trochophore larva to the juvenile is made. Similarly, for wood-decaying crustacean orders, Amphipoda and Isopoda, their distribution, habitat, foraging behaviours and body features are discussed.    Finally, insects, the most speciose group of animals of the planet is introduced and taxonomically classified. Their body segmentation is described and their life cycles from the egg to imago are explained, including the different modes of their post-embryonic development. Their feeding habits are also explicated for herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivores insects. General information on the biology and ecology of all wood-damaging orders are provided at last with special reference on wooden Cultural Heritage deteriogens, Coleoptera and Blattodea.","Pournou, A.",,"Pournou, Anastasia, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-46504-9_3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its large and confusing morphological variability, it was subdivided into several ‘forms’, four of which described from Austrian caves. To shed light on this chaotic situation, we sampled the type localities of all described species and forms in the complex, as well as additional sites in Austria, and used nuclear (28S, ITS) and mtDNA (COI) sequences to revise its taxonomy. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the <i>Niphargus tatrensis</i> species complex is monophyletic. Applying four species delimitation methods to the COI dataset converged on the presence of four species in Austria; by contrast, the same methods applied to ITS concurred with a haploweb analysis of this marker in distinguishing only three species in the country. Reconstruction of ancestral ranges suggested that the Austrian clade originated in Eastern Europe. Bayesian biogeographical analyses revealed a complex history of lineage divergence and secondary contact during the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, possibly responsible for the higher variability of COI in comparison with ITS. Based on the above, we conclude that only three valid species are present in Austria: considering all described forms as subspecies, two of them are elevated to species rank whereas one new species is formally described and illustrated.","Stoch, F.; Christian, E.; Flot, J.-F.",WOS:000575774700001,"Christian, Erhard, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13127-020-00462-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, CP 160-12,Ave FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Belgium,Species delimitation methods; Haploweb; Groundwaters; Caves; Bayesian biogeographic analysis,SPECIES DELIMITATION; CRUSTACEA; GENUS; WATER; PERSPECTIVE; DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE; RANGES; TREE,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Free University of Brussels (VUB),,Belgium,o,University,Science

The data come from 907 unique spatial areas and mostly fall within two time periods, 1959–1969 and 1987–1997, during which there are more data available compared to other time periods. Data were extracted from 62 sources identified through a systematic literature review, targeting peer-reviewed and gray literature. The purpose of this database is to consolidate data into a common format to address gaps in our ecological understanding of the North Pacific Ocean, particularly with respect to salmon. This database can be used to address a variety of questions regarding salmon foraging, productivity, and marine survival.

Consequently, bioaccumulation, and in particular biomagnification of MPs and associated chemical additives, are often inferred to occur in marine food webs. Presented here are the results of a systematic literature review to examine whether current, published findings support the premise that MPs and associated chemical additives bioaccumulate and biomagnify across a general marine food web. First, field and laboratory-derived contamination data on marine species were standardised by sample size from a total of 116 publications. Second, following assignment of each species to one of five main trophic levels, the average uptake of MPs and of associated chemical additives was estimated across all species within each level. These uptake data within and across the five trophic levels were then critically examined for any evidence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Findings corroborate previous studies that MP bioaccumulation occurs within each trophic level, while current evidence around bioaccumulation of associated chemical additives is much more ambiguous. In contrast, MP biomagnification across a general marine food web is not supported by current field observations, while results from the few laboratory studies supporting trophic transfer are hampered by using unrealistic exposure conditions. Further, a lack of both field and laboratory data precludes an examination of potential trophic transfer and biomagnification of chemical additives associated with MPs. Combined, these findings indicate that, although bioaccumulation of MPs occurs within trophic levels, no clear sign of MP biomagnification in situ was observed at the higher trophic levels. Recommendations for future studies to focus on investigating ingestion, retention and depuration rates for MPs and chemical additives under environmentally realistic conditions, and on examining the potential of multi-level trophic transfer for MPs and chemical additives have been made.","Miller, M.E.; Hamann, M.; Kroon, F.J.",WOS:000585918300008,"Hamann, Mark, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0240792,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",Australia,,POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; POLYSTYRENE MICROPLASTICS; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; VIRGIN MICROPLASTICS; TROPHIC TRANSFER; INGESTION; FISH; SEA; ENVIRONMENT; CONTAMINATION,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,James Cook University,x,Australia,,University,Science

The situation of streams subject to low intensity agriculture relying on human and animal labour, as in parts of Romania, remains unknown. To close this gap, we determined concentrations of 244&nbsp;pesticides and metabolites at 19 low-order streams, covering sites from low to high intensity agriculture in a region of Romania. Pesticides were sampled with two passive sampling methods (styrene-divinylbenzene (SDB) disks and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets) during three rainfall events and at base flow. Using the toxic unit approach, we assessed the toxicity towards algae and invertebrates. Up to 50 pesticides were detected simultaneously, resulting in sum concentrations between 0.02 and 37&nbsp;µg&nbsp;L<sup>-1</sup>. Both, the sum concentration as well as the toxicities were in a similar range as in high intensity agricultural streams of Western Europe. Different proxies of agricultural intensity did not relate to in-stream pesticide toxicity, contradicting the assumption of previous studies. The toxicity towards invertebrates was positively related to large scale variables such as the catchment size and the agricultural land use in the upstream catchment and small scale variables including riparian plant height, whereas the toxicity to algae showed no relationship to any of the variables. Our results suggest that streams in low intensity agriculture, despite a minor reported use of agrochemicals, exhibit similar levels of pesticide pollution as in regions of high intensity agriculture.","Schreiner, V.C.; Link, M.; Kunz, S.; Szöcs, E.; Scharmüller, A.; Vogler, B.; Beck, B.; Battes, K.P.; Cimpean, M.; Singer, H.P.; Hollender, J.; Schäfer, R.B.",WOS:000599515700012,"Schreiner, Verena, V.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116528,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Monitoring; Pesticide toxicity; Anthropogenic stressors; Streams; Drivers; Romania,Journal article,,,"Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, iES Landau, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",Germany,Monitoring; Pesticide toxicity; Anthropogenic stressors; Streams; Drivers; Romania,SURFACE WATERS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; STREAMS; EXPOSURE; CALIBRATION; TOXICITY; URBAN; INSECTICIDES; PYRETHROIDS; MITIGATION,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,University of Koblenz and Landau,,Germany,,University,Science

Replicate Juday net sampling in October and February from 1983 to 2005, which included five repeated tows from bottom to surface, was conducted in Saltfjord and Mistfjord, northern Norway. The time-series provided evidence of in situ variability in species abundance, as well as seasonal and interannual changes in standing stock abundance. The shallow sill of one fjord caused accumulation of coastal water in the fjord’s basin, while the other fjord’s deeper sill selected denser water of Atlantic origin from the same open shelf habitat. The selective advection caused differences in the immigration of species recruiting to the fjords’ specific overwintering communities of zooplankton. Statistical analyses of the cumulated replicate data indicated significant in situ variability in the spatial density of species. Cases with an abundance of carnivores relating positively to other species probably resulted from the carnivores’ attraction to patches with concentrations of prey. Interspecific negative density relations likely indicated either predator avoidance or substantial trophic activity during the sampling. During years of high abundance, some wintering stocks of carnivores evidently reduced the local stocks of overwintering prey. We conclude that predator–prey interactions and stock variability in Subarctic fjords result from complex bio-geophysical interactions that occur on the scales of local habitats and basin-scale population systems.","Skreslet, S.; Espinasse, M.; Olsen, K.; Espinasse, B.D.",WOS:000587664900001,"Skreslet, Stig, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.33265/polar.v39.3300,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Chaetognatha, ""Coelenterata"", ""Crustacea"", ""Polychaeta""",,,"Crustacea, Polychaeta, Chaetognatha, Coelenterata, advection, predation",Journal article,,,"Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, POB 614, NO-8622 Mo I Rana, Norway.",Norway,Crustacea; Polychaeta; Chaetognatha; Coelenterata; advection; predation,DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; CALANUS-FINMARCHICUS; GREENLAND SEA; WATER; MORTALITY; HABITATS; PATTERNS; POPULATION; NORVEGICA; COPEPODS,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Oceanography",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Oceanography,Nord University - Faculty of Bioscience and Aquaculture,,Norway,,University,Science

Here, 8670 dead bivalve specimens were collected from several sandy, sandy-rock mixed, and sandy-clay mixed beach, and beaches associated with tidal flat and sea-grass habitat. Sampling stations were located along a stretch of about 2500 km covering several ecoregions along the eastern Indian coast, a large-scale, biogeographic pattern in biostratinomy is studied. Each shell was assigned seven grades based on shell damages intensities in reference to seven biostratinomic attributes (shell completeness, surface bioerosion, secondary rounding, abrasion, ligament loss, and external and internal wear); the summation of these values indicate the Total Taphonomic Grade (TTG) of individual specimens. Our results suggest, TTG values do not vary systematically with ecological factors (e.g., body size and shape, shell microstructure, etc.), although environmental (e.g., substrate and energy conditions) factors could play some role (e.g., high energy sandy beaches have higher TTG values); no large-scale biogeographic gradient is observed. Based on the characteristics of damage profiles, a siliciclastic beach taphofacies, common in all locations, is proposed: abrasion is the main damage type, whereas, shell fragmentation or biotic damages are negligible. Based on these, a biostratinomic pathway of shells is inferred: after death, shells are immediately locally transported to the beach, reducing exposure time for biotic damages; on beaches, constant swash and backwash cause external and internal abrasion. These taphofacies and biostratinomic pathway models can be used to identify the biostratinomic conditions of analogous modern and fossil assemblages.","Mondal, S.; Ghosh, R.; Chatterjee, K.; Chakraborty, H.",WOS:000609305900005,"Mondal, Subhronil, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.107073,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,Taphonomy; Total taphonomic grade; Diagenesis; Spatio-environmental variation; Bivalves,Journal article,,,"Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur 741246, W Bengal, India.",India,Taphonomy; Total taphonomic grade; Diagenesis; Spatio-environmental variation; Bivalves,MOLLUSCAN DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; BIVALVE TAPHONOMY; CARBONATE SETTINGS; FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGES; LIFE HABITS; SHELL BEDS; TIME; PRESERVATION; RESOLUTION; PREDATION,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata (IISER Kolkata),x,India,,Research institute,Science

The species richness of nematode assemblages is high, with 215 species, 138 genus, 35 families, seven orders and two classes. That γ-diversity is higher than other studies and points to seagrass beds as diversity hotspots of free-living marine nematodes. Local species richness in seagrass bed sites is about 57 ± 17 species and broadly similar across the sites, despite the environmental heterogeneity. The geographical distance plays a weak, but significant, role on the decay of similarity likely affected by limited dispersal of nematodes.

Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências: Lisbon. xvi, 232 pp.","The realization that human activities have a major influence on ecosystems from local to global scales has given rise to the concept of the Anthropocene. However, although the influence of human activities on biodiversity is clearly significant, it remains unclear to what extent the rate and magnitude of biodiversity changes differ from pre-human dynamics. Islands are ideal model systems for understanding the relative contribution of environmental and societal variables to biodiversity change because the onset of human activities on islands can generally be clearly defined. The aim of this PhD thesis is to place human-environment interactions on islands in the context of environmental fluctuations over the Quaternary. The thesis consists of two parts. First, I quantify how island area and isolation have changed over the Quaternary as a result of climate-driven sea-level fluctuations, and analyse how these dynamics have shaped modern biodiversity patterns. Secondly, I study how human activities in the past and present have shaped island ecosystems and landscapes, and compare their rate and magnitude to pre-human dynamics. Overall, the findings of my thesis indicate that modern biodiversity patterns show legacies of past human activities but are also imprinted by environmental dynamics in deep-time. Furthermore, the rate of change following human settlement on islands can largely exceed Quaternary background rates. Therefore, my findings are in line with studies that indicate that human activities have become a major driver in shaping biodiversity across scales. Nonetheless, my comparison of islands worldwide also highlights the diverse ways in which abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables have interacted across individual islands. Therefore, future studies should acknowledge that global biodiversity change can manifest differently across localities. Finally, I emphasize the importance of strengthening interdisciplinary approaches in island biogeography to enhance our understanding of biodiversity changes in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to deeptime dynamics.","Norder, S.J.",,"Norder, Sietze, S.J.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduce <i>Vicetia bizzottoi</i> sp. nov. based on a Priabonian fossil found in northeastern Italy, the largest documented cowrie found so far and the youngest of a lineage of Eocene Gisortiinae species. The Gisortiinae stratigraphic record in western Europe indicates that species selection favoured large size and armouring of the shell. Palaeoecology and per-stage species richness suggest that gigantism occurred in peripheral habitats with respect to diversity hotspots, where smaller species were favoured. The Eocene–Oligocene boundary was marked by a turnover and the Chattian global warming favoured small-sized species of derived clades. Species selection leading to gigantism is further documented in Miocene lineages of <i>Zoila</i> and <i>Umbilia</i>, in the southern hemisphere, two extant genera distributed at the periphery of modern diversity hotspots, suggesting that the negative relationship between size and diversity is a recurring pattern in the evolutionary history of cowries. This palaeontological evidence is projected onto the existing hypotheses that explain analogous biogeographic patterns in various other taxa. Likewise, body size-species richness negative relationship was possibly driven in cowries by physiological, ecological and life history constraints.","Dominici, S.; Fornasiero, M.; Giusberti, L.",WOS:000600104900060,"Fornasiero, Mariagabriella, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-78940-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Firenze, Museo Storia Nat, Florence, Italy.",Italy,,BODY-SIZE; HAMPSHIRE BASIN; MIDDLE EOCENE; MARINE; HISTORY; DIVERSIFICATION; CAENOGASTROPODA; TEMPERATURE; ECTOTHERMS; DIVERSITY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Florence,,Italy,,University,Science

They also have the potential for reciprocal interactions when colocated, through a wide variety of potential mechanisms involving different directions in effect. Pathways mediated by biogenic structure could be facilitative through protection from predation or bioturbators, or by harboring beneficial interactors, or alternatively could result in competition for space or reduced food supply. Other pathways mediated by biological activity could positively link autotrophic roles of seagrass and heterotrophic roles of bivalves, but excessive organic matter production or nutrient release could be damaging. Published studies were compiled for a meta-analysis of field experiments testing bivalve response to seagrass (25 studies) and vice versa (11 studies), as well as for surveys of bivalves in and out of seagrass (39 studies). In experiments, seagrass improved bivalve survival, and bivalves at high cover reduced seagrass density, but seven other response metrics showed no consistent change. In surveys of particular bivalve species, densities were 1.6 times higher in seagrass than out of seagrass. This augmentation did not differ by body size but was especially pronounced in some functional groups, especially lucinid and solemyid bivalves harboring sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Weak overall directional effects of colocation of seagrass and bivalves reflect weak effects in some individual studies, for instance because of low densities in soft-sediment systems, as well as strong but inconsistent effects because different pathways of interaction dominate. Therefore, generalizations about the outcome of interactions between these two ecosystem engineers when they are colocated cannot be made, although coexistence is typically enabled by weak or positive interactions. Further work is needed, especially outside of some well-studied regions, to explore the specific mechanisms and spatiotemporal scales enabling seagrasses and bivalves to coexist because there are many pathways at work.","Fales, R.J.; Boardman, F.C.; Ruesink, J.L.",WOS:000606573000005,"Fales, Robin, R.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.039.0305,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Washington, Dept Biol, POB 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",USA,bivalves; molluscs; seagrass,PATCH SIZE; MYTILUS-EDULIS; NURSERY ROLE; WILLAPA BAY; OYSTER; EELGRASS; ASSEMBLAGES; HABITAT; ESTUARINE; DENSITY,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Washington,x,USA,,University,Science

For a population biology study of this species, monthly collections were carried out at Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas over a period of 2 y (March 2016–March 2018). High densities were registered in both studied years: 84,560 (±22,066) ind. m<sup>–2</sup> in the first year and 65,848 (±7,830) in the second year. Growth was lower for the first year (<i>K</i> = 0.4 for year 1 and <i>K</i> = 0.8 for year 2), whereas seasonal oscillation (<i>C</i> = 0.6) was of the same intensity in both years. The period of lower growth differed for the years, occurring in June (WP = 0.5) in the first year and in August (WP = 0.7) in the second year. The maximum and asymptotic lengths, longevity, secondary production, biomass, and turnover rate were higher for the first year; on the other hand, mortality was higher at the second year. Density of the invasive mussel was significantly and positively related with salinity (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.5547; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). In a general way, the second year of study seems to be a more adverse period for the population of the invasive mussel with reduced density, body sizes, life expectancy, secondary production, biomass, and higher mortality. Among environmental factors, salinity seems to exert the strongest influence on the regulation of population attributes.","Neto, A.D.S.M.; Caetano, C.H.S.; Cardoso, R.S.",WOS:000606573000011,"Neto, Altir, A.D.S.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.039.0311,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mytilopsis leucophaeata,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro UNIRIO, Dept Zool, Lab Zool Invertebrados Marinhos, Av Pasteur,458,Sl 309, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",Brazil,Mytilopsis leucophaeata; brackish water; Dreissenidae; population dynamics; growth; mortality; secondary production,DARK FALSE MUSSEL; BRACKISH-WATER MUSSEL; ZEBRA MUSSEL; NATIVE BIVALVES; ADAMSI MORRISON; CONRAD; GROWTH; RIVER; MOLLUSCA; MARINE,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO),x,Brazil,,University,Science

Eight host specimens were collected between 2002 and 2008 at 2 collecting sites off the eastern coast of Borneo: 6 from the Kinabatangan River (Malaysia) and 2 from a fish market in Tarakan (Indonesia). Two of these individuals were found to be infected with a total of 3 new species of <i>Tetragonocephalum</i> Shipley and Hornell, 1905. <i>Tetragonocephalum georgei</i> n. sp. and <i>Tetragonocephalum opimum</i> n. sp. were recovered from a host specimen from the Kinabatangan River, and <i>Tetragonocephalum levicorpum</i> n. sp. was found parasitizing a host specimen purchased at a fish market in Tarakan. Specimens of each of the new species were prepared for light microscopy; specimens of 2 of the new species were prepared for scanning electron microscopy, and histological sections were prepared for 1 of the new species.

Our previous study has successfully differentiated species of box jellyfish using DNA sequencing to support the morphological study.

The SYBR green-based real-time PCR panel was performed for rapid species identification. The sensitivity and specificity of the panel were determined by testing samples of different species. Moreover, we applied the panel to the tentacle sample from a real patient, which helped confirm the animal-of-cause of envenomation. Our results show a success for species identification of box jellyfish using 16S rRNA and COI PCR panel, which revealed congruence between molecular and morphological identification. Furthermore, the panel worked very well with the unknown samples and jellyfish tissue from the real envenomation case.

Some of the most studied patterns in deep-sea biology are those related to bathymetrical gradients. For meiofauna and nematodes, such studies have highlighted the importance of recognizing regional differences in using ecological mechanisms to explain those patterns. Despite holding significant fisheries and oil and gas resources, the eastern Brazilian Continental Margin is poorly understood with respect to its seafloor biology and ecology. To answer ecological questions of deep-sea infaunal structural and functional diversity in relation to bathymetrical patterns, we used nematode data from five bathymetric transects (400, 1000, 1900, 2500, and 3000 m water depth) sampled in 2011 and 2013 on the Espírito Santo slope off the coast of southeast (SE) Brazil. Deep nematode community analysis based on 6763 nematode identifications showed very high levels of diversity (201 genera; 43 families) compared to other ocean basins and deep-sea regions. Our analyses showed that there is a distinct bathymetric break in standing stocks and community structure between 1000 and 1900 m. Nematode standing stocks were much higher at 400 and 1000 m compared to those for similar depths worldwide, likely linked to the intense and frequent upwelling and specific hydrographic and topographic identity of the region. The bathymetric break was not present for structural and functional nematode diversity. Instead, bathymetric regressions showed that they increased gradually toward 3000 m water depth. The deep Espírito Santo basin is characterized by rich and equitable nematode communities that are both mature and trophically diverse. General deep-sea ecological theories apply to our findings, but there are also substantial regional effects related to the local margin topography, upwelling, and oceanographic and hydrodynamic processes that make the Espírito Santo Basin a unique and diverse deep-sea ecosystem.","dos Santos, G.A.P.; Silva, A.C.; Esteves, A.M.; Ribeiro-Ferreira, V.P.; Neres, P.F.; Valdes, Y.; Ingels, J.",WOS:000601948600001,"Ribeiro-Ferreira, Venina, V.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d12120485,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,deep sea; Nematoda; continental slope; bathymetric gradient; diversity; ecosystem function; Brazil; Atlantic Ocean,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Biosci, BR-58397000 Areia, Brazil.",Brazil,deep sea; Nematoda; continental slope; bathymetric gradient; diversity; ecosystem function; Brazil; Atlantic Ocean,NEMATODE ASSEMBLAGES; QUANTITATIVE DISTRIBUTION; BRAZILIAN MARGIN; BENTHIC RESPONSE; ORGANIC-MATTER; MATURITY INDEX; STANDING STOCK; NORTH-ATLANTIC; BIODIVERSITY; MEIOFAUNA,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB),,Brazil,,University,Science

Nowadays, taxonomic nomenclature is ruled by four independent international codes, and according to them, the existence of hemihomonyms and homonyms is accepted under some conditions as an exception to the general rule. This situation entails confusion, disagreements, and a plethora of problems whose consequences could worsen in the near future within the framework of the big data era. Moreover, the increasing use of big databases and analyses, data science, bioinformatics, biological monitoring, and bioassessment has shown such exceptions to be inconvenient, since these exceptions to homonyms are considered as duplicates by databases and statistical software, which are handled by non-taxonomist experts. International Codes of Nomenclature must change within the new context of big data analysis. This work aims to propose the elimination of any exception to the presence of homonyms and to evaluate whether the Independence Principle makes sense within this new context. Increasing coordination between several independent nomenclatural systems is essential and, perhaps, we must conduct our efforts towards a universal species list, finishing with the historical schism between Codes.","Sánchez-González, J.R.",WOS:000601924900001,"Sánchez-González, Jorge, J.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d12120472,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,taxonomic nomenclature; big data era; hemi- and homonyms; data science; BioCode; Darwin Core; Globally Unique Identifiers; Life Science Identifier,Journal article,,,"Univ Lleida, Dept Anim Sci, Wildlife Sect, Av Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain.",Spain,taxonomic nomenclature; big data era; hemi; and homonyms; data science; BioCode; Darwin Core; Globally Unique Identifiers; Life Science Identifier,,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Universitat de Lleida,,Spain,,University,Science

This study provides the most recent survey of epibenthic communities in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait and explores their relationships with environmental variables, including mean annual primary production and particulate organic carbon in surface water, bottom oceanographic variables, and substrate type. Epibenthic trawl samples were collected at 46 stations, with a total of 380 epibenthic taxa identified, representing 71% of the estimated taxa within the system. Three communities were defined based on biomass and taxonomic composition. Ordination analyses showed them to be associated primarily with substrate type, salinity, and annual primary production. A first community, associated with coarse substrate, was distributed along the coastlines and near the river mouths. This community was characterized by the lowest density and taxonomic richness and the highest biomass of filter and suspension feeders. A second community, composed mostly of deposit feeders and small abundant epibenthic organisms, was associated with soft substrate and distributed in the deepest waters. A third community, associated with mixed substrate and mostly located near polynyas, was characterized by high diversity and biomass, with no clearly dominant taxon. The overall analysis indicated that bottom salinity and surface-water particulate organic carbon content were the main environmental drivers of these epibenthic community patterns. In the face of climate change, projections of increased river inflow and a longer open water season for the HBS could have major impacts on these epibenthic communities, emphasizing a need to continually improve our ability to evaluate and predict shifts in epibenthic richness and distribution.","Pierrejean, M.; Babb, D.G.; Maps, F.; Nozais, C.; Archambault, P.",WOS:000615210600002,"Maps, Frédéric, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1525/elementa.00044,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Arctic, Hudson Bay System, Epibenthic communities, Environmental variables, Substrate type, Salinity",Journal article,,,"Univ Laval, Dept Biol, ArcticNet, Quebec Ocean,Takuvik, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",Canada,Arctic; Hudson Bay System; Epibenthic communities; Environmental variables; Substrate type; Salinity,SEA-ICE; STRAIT; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; SUMMER; CANADA; REGION; EXPORT,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,University of Laval,,Canada,,University,Science

Despite the considerable lack of information, it can be observed from the recent literature that this group of animals possesses an astonishing arsenal of molecules from different origins that provide the molluscs with potent chemicals that are ecologically and pharmacologically relevant. In this review, we analyze the bioactivity of more than 450 compounds from ca. 400 species of heterobranch molluscs that are useful for the snails to protect themselves in different ways and/or that may be useful to us because of their pharmacological activities. Their ecological activities include predator avoidance, toxicity, antimicrobials, antifouling, trail-following and alarm pheromones, sunscreens and UV protection, tissue regeneration, and others. The most studied ecological activity is predation avoidance, followed by toxicity. Their pharmacological activities consist of cytotoxicity and antitumoral activity; antibiotic, antiparasitic, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity; and activity against neurodegenerative diseases and others. The most studied pharmacological activities are cytotoxicity and anticancer activities, followed by antibiotic activity. Overall, it can be observed that heterobranch molluscs are extremely interesting in regard to the study of marine natural products in terms of both chemical ecology and biotechnology studies, providing many leads for further detailed research in these fields in the near future.","Avila, C.; Angulo-Preckler, C.",WOS:000602028700001,"Avila, Conxita, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/md18120657,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Gastropoda, ""Mollusca""",,,marine natural products; Mollusca; Gastropoda; chemical ecology,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of the experiment revealed that both wild (<em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1450) and hatchery-bred spat (<em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1450) had comparable growth rates in grow-out culture.

To address this, we compared DNA barcoding repositories with the marine biodiversity species for the Southeast Pacific.

Of the 5504 species records retrieved from OBIS, 42% of them had at least one registered specimen in BOLD (including specimens around the world); however, only 4.5% of records corresponded to publicly available DNA barcodes including specimens collected from a Southeast Pacific country. The low representation of barcoded species does not vary much across the different taxonomic groups or within countries, but we observed an asymmetric distribution of DNA barcoding records for taxonomic groups along the coast, being more abundant for the Humboldt Current System than the Pacific Central-American Coastal. We observed high-level of barcode records with Barcode Index Number (BIN) incongruences, particularly for fishes (Actinopterygii = 30.27% and Elasmobranchii = 24.71%), reflecting taxonomic uncertainties for fishes, whereas for Invertebrates and Mammalia more than 85% of records were classified as data deficient or inadequate procedure for DNA barcoding.
