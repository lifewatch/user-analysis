Potential changes in benthic macrofaunal distributions from the English Channel simulated under climate change scenarios. <i>Est., Coast. and Shelf Sci. 99(1)</i>: 153-161. <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.12.026"" target=""_blank"">https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.12.026</a>","Climate-induced changes in the distribution of species are likely to affect the functioning and diversity of marine ecosystems. Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (<em>sensu</em> Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, <em>Pecten maximus</em> and <em>Glycymeris glycymeris</em>, and two ecologically important species, <em>Abra alba</em> and <em>Ophelia borealis</em> were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050â€“2059 and 2090â€“2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for <em>A.</em>Â <em>alba</em>. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future. The displacement and colonisation success of species are a function of many other non-climatic factors such as species life histories, dispersal abilities, adaptability and community interactions.","Rombouts, I.; Beaugrand, G.; Dauvin, J.C.","WOS:000302448300015","Rombouts, Isabelle, I.","Univ Sci Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, UMR CNRS LOG 8187, F-62930 Wimereux, France.","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.12.026","","EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""","English Channel","","Climatic changes, ""Ecological niches"", ""Modelling""","","Benthic macrofauna","Journal article","","","Univ Sci Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, UMR CNRS LOG 8187, 28 Ave Foch, F-62930 Wimereux, France.","France","benthic macrofauna; English Channel; ecological niche; Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche; model; climate change scenarios; CHARM","HABITAT-SUITABILITY; SAMPLE-SIZE; MODELS; NICHE; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; ENVELOPE; IMPACTS; BRITAIN; AREA","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Joint Research Unit: Laboratory for Oceanology and Geosciences (LOG) (UMR 8187)","","France","","Research network","Science","OK","{'SDG_13': 2.0, 'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_6': 1.0}"

We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discoveredResults: There are ~226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (~20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ~170,000 synonyms, that 58,000â€“72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000â€“741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7â€“1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 Â± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science.Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.","Appeltans, W.; Ahyong, S.T.; Anderson, G.; Angel, M.V.; Artois, T.; Bailly, N.; Bamber, R.N.; Barber, A.; Bartsch, I.; Berta, A.; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz , M.; Bock, P.; Boxshall, G.; Boyko, C.B.; Nunes BrandÃ£o, S.; Bray, R.A.; Bruce, N.L.; Cairns, S.D.; Chan, T.-Y.; Cheng, L.; Collins, A.G.; Cribb, T.H.; Curini-Galletti, M.; Dahdouh-Guebas, F.; Davie, P.J.F.; Dawson, M.N.; De Clerck, O.; Decock, W.; De Grave, S.; de Voogd, N.J.; Domning, D.P.; Emig, C.C.; ErsÃ©us, Ch.; Eschmeyer, W.; Fauchald, K.; Fautin, D.G.; Feist, S.W.; Fransen, C.H.J.M.; Furuya, H.; GarcÃ­a-Alvarez, O.; Gerken, S.; Gibson, D.; Gittenberger, A.; Gofas, S.; GÃ³mez-Daglio, L.; Gordon, D.P.; Guiry, M.D.; Hernandez, F.; Hoeksema, B.W.; Hopcroft, R.R.; Jaume, D.; Kirk, P.; Koedam, N.; Koenemann, S.; Kolb, J.B.; Kristensen, R.M.; Kroh, A.; Lambert, G.; Lazarus, D.B.; Lemaitre, R.; Longshaw, M.; Lowry, J.; MacPherson, E.; Madin, L.P.; Mah, C.; Mapstone, G.; McLaughlin, P.A.; Mees, J.; Meland, K.; Messing, C.G.; Mills, C.E.; Molodtsova, T.N.; Mooi, R.; Neuhaus, B.; Ng, P.K.L.; Nielsen, C.; Norenburg, J.; Opresko, D.M.; Osawa, M.; Paulay, G.; Perrin, W.; Pilger, J.F.; Poore, G.C.B.; Pugh, Ph.R.; Read, G.B.; Reimer, J.D.; Rius, M.; Rocha, R.M.; SÃ¡iz Salinas, J.I.; Scarabino, V.; Schierwater, B.; Schmidt-Rhaesa, A.; Schnabel, K.E.; Schotte, M.; Schuchert, P.; Schwabe, E.; Segers, H.; Self-Sullivan, C.; Shenkar, N.; Siegel, V.; Sterrer, W.; StÃ¶hr, S.; Swalla, B.; Tasker, M.L.; Thuesen, E.V.; Timm, T.; Todaro, M.A.; Turon, X.; Tyler, S.; Uetz, P.; van der Land, J.; Vanhoorne, B.; van Ofwegen, L.P.; Van Soest, R.W.M.; Vanaverbeke, J.; Walker-Smith, G.K.; Walter, T.C.; Warren, A.; Williams, G.C.; Wilson, S.P.; Costello, M.J.","WOS:000312115300015","Costello, Mark, M.J.","","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.036","","LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","Global","","Species diversity","","","Journal article","","","Flanders Marine Inst, Flemish Marine Data & Informat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","","RICHNESS; FUTURE; BIODIVERSITY; TAXONOMY; RATES","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","x","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{}"

Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how WoRMS publishes online quality assured information on marine species.Within WoRMS, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management.By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of WoRMS, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management.","Costello, M.J.; Bouchet, P.; Boxshall, G.; Fauchald, K.; Gordon, D.; Hoeksema, B.W.; Poore, G.C.B.; Van Soest, R.W.M.; StÃ¶hr, S.; Walter, T.C.; Vanhoorne, B.; Decock, W.; Appeltans, W.","WOS:000313551500006","Gordon, Dennis, D.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0051629","","European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","Biodiversity, ""Databases"", ""Standardization"", ""Taxonomy""","","","Journal article","","","Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland 1, New Zealand.","New Zealand","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; TAXONOMY; COLLECTIONS; INFORMATION; CONSERVATION; PUBLICATION; RICHNESS; IMPACT; OCEAN; RATES","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","University of Auckland - Leigh Marine Laboratory","x","New Zealand","","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 4.0, 'SDG_11': 1.0}"

Alternatively, pantropical distributions challenge the belief of limited intrinsic dispersal capacity of marine seaweeds and the effectiveness of the north-south oriented continents as dispersal barriers. We aimed to re-assess the distribution of two allegedly circumtropical brown algae, Dictyota ciliolata and D. crenulata, and interpret the realized geographical range of the respective species in relation to their thermal tolerance and major tectonic and climatic events during the Cenozoic.    Methodology/Principal Findings    Species delimitation was based on 184 chloroplast encoded psbA sequences, using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by analyzing a six-gene dataset. Divergence times were estimated using relaxed molecular clock methods and published calibration data. Distribution ranges of the species were inferred from DNA-confirmed records, complemented with credible literature data and herbarium vouchers. Temperature tolerances of the species were determined by correlating distribution records with local SST values. We found considerable conflict between traditional and DNA-based species definitions. Dictyota crenulata consists of several pseudocryptic species, which have restricted distributions in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Central America. In contrast, the pantropical distribution of D. ciliolata is confirmed and linked to its significantly wider temperature tolerance.    Conclusions/Significance    Tectonically driven rearrangements of physical barriers left an unequivocal imprint on the current diversity patterns of marine macroalgae, as witnessed by the D. crenulataâ€“complex. The nearly circumglobal tropical distribution of D. ciliolata, however, demonstrates that the north-south oriented continents do not present absolute dispersal barriers for species characterized by wide temperature tolerances.","Tronholm, A.; Leliaert, F.; SansÃ³n, M.; Afonso-Carrillo, J.; Tyberghein, L.; Verbruggen, H.; De Clerck, O.","WOS:000301703800032","Verbruggen, Heroen, H.","Phycology Research Group and Centre for Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Ghent University","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0030813","","Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""","","","","","","Journal article","","","","","","","","","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Phycology","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_15': 1.0}"

The pole-ward shift has already begun for many temperate seaweed species that are important intertidal foundation species. We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: <i>Fucus serratus</i>,<i> Fucus vesiculosus,</i> and <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT. Model predictions suggest that these three species will shift northwards as an assemblage or â€œunitâ€ and that phytogeographic changes will be most pronounced in the southern Arctic and the southern temperate provinces. Our models predict that Arctic shores in Canada, Greenland, and Spitsbergen will become suitable for all three species by 2100. Shores south of 45Â° North will become unsuitable for at least two of the three focal species on both the Northwest- and Northeast-Atlantic coasts by 2200. If these foundational species are unable to adapt to the rising temperatures, they will lose their centers of genetic diversity and their loss will trigger an unpredictable shift in the North-Atlantic intertidal ecosystem.","Jueterbock, A.; Tyberghein, L.; Verbruggen, H.; Coyer, J.A.; Olsen, J.L.; Hoarau, G.","WOS:000318802500020","Tyberghein, Lennert, L.","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","http://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.541","","Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""","","Ascophyllum, ""Fucus""","","","     Ascophyllum ;     ecological niche models;     Fucus ;     geographic distribution;     global warming;     intertidal;     macroalgae;     species distribution models","Journal article","","","","","","","","","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_13': 3.0, 'SDG_14': 3.0, 'SDG_3': 1.0}"

We introduce two methods that aim to improve the transferability of presence-only models: density-based occurrence thinning and performance-based predictor selection. We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea (previously Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea) and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process. The inferred distribution model of Caulerpa cylindracea shows the potential for this species to further spread along the coasts of Western Europe, western Africa and the south coast of Australia.","Verbruggen, H.; Tyberghein, L.; Belton, G.S.; Mineur, F.; Jueterbock, A.; Hoarau, G.; Gurgel, C.

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARs.","Reubens, J.; De Rijcke, M.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.","WOS:000329884700021","De Rijcke, Maarten, M.","Ghent University, Biology Department, Marine Biology Section","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2013.05.005","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Gadus morhua","","","    Diel Activity;     Gadus morhua;     Feeding;     Artificial Hard Substrates;     Offshore Wind Farms","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Diel Activity; Gadus morhua; Feeding; Artificial Hard Substrates; Offshore Wind Farms","GADUS-MORHUA; ARTIFICIAL REEFS; STOMACH CONTENTS; NORTH-SEA; TRISOPTERUS-LUSCUS; PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; SITE FIDELITY; BEHAVIOR; FISH; FISHERIES","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL)","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_2': 8.0, 'SDG_14': 8.0, 'SDG_3': 2.0}"

From 2009 until 2012 the behavioural ecology of Atlantic cod and pouting was investigated at WARs in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS). Information on length-frequency distribution, diet, community structure and movements were combined to gain insights on the behavioural ecology and to unravel whether production occurs. We demonstrated that specific age groups of Atlantic cod and pouting are seasonally attracted towards the WARs, that they show high site fidelity and feed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present. Growth was observed throughout the period the fishes were present. Production on a local scale can be assumed. On a regional scale however, no changes were observed yet.

Specifically at the beaches, predictions on sea-level rise, storms and flood risk from the North Sea have led to several big coastal defence projects. Management of sandy beaches is therefore a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined and where biodiversity should be taken into account.In this study, the biological value of the shallow Belgian coastal zone was derived based on a detailed and integrated dataset (1995â€“2011) of all available ecological information on macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos and birds. The 67 km Belgian coastline was divided into an across-shore intertidal and shallow subtidal subzone, and into along-shore subzones of 250 m for benthic components and 3 km for birds. The intrinsic biological value of each subzone was then calculated using the biological valuation method, and the pertained score, ranging from very low to very high, was plotted accordingly in order to obtain a marine biological valuation map.Following trends were detected: (1) a strong mosaic pattern of biological value along the coastline; (2) a clear lack of (benthic) data at the eastern part of the Belgian coast; (3) a rather high biological value in around 70% of the shallow subtidal subzones, compared to the intertidal part; and (4) a high/very high biological value in intertidal zones located immediately to the east of the harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende and Zeebrugge.A detailed analysis of protected areas and areas under coastal flood risk indicated that biological valuation maps are very promising management tools for local decision-makers as they allow for an early integration of â€˜natural/ecological valuesâ€™ in policy implementation.","Vanden Eede, S.; Laporta, L.; Deneudt, K.; Stienen, E.; Derous, S.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.","WOS:000339534800007","Laporta, Lia, L.","Ghent University, Biology Department, Marine Biology Section","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.04.022","","LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","Belgian Coast","","Spatial planning","","Marine spatial planning; biological valuation","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","","LANICE-CONCHILEGA; GREY DUNES; ECOSYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; SEA; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SERVICES; DEFINITION; ECOLOGY","Oceanography; Water Resources","Oceanography; Water Resources","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL)","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 7.0, 'SDG_3': 6.0, 'SDG_2': 3.0}"

This Flemish Fish Monitoring Network aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals in both inland waters and estuaries. This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of nonnative fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or VIS. From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the INBO IPT as two datasets: â€˜VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgiumâ€™ and â€˜VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgiumâ€™. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 44,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt (â€œZeescheldeâ€), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 69 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species. To foster broad and collaborative use, the data are dedicated to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver and reference the INBO norms for data use.

Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS recordsâ€”passing a specific combination of these QC stepsâ€”is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves. Through LifeWatch, users can already upload their own data and check them against a selection of the here described quality control procedures.","Vandepitte, L.; Bosch, S.; Tyberghein, L.; Waumans, F.; Vanhoorne, B.; Hernandez, F.; De Clerck, O.; Mees, J.","WOS:000348650000001","Mees, Jan, J.","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/database/bau125","","EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","","Journal article","","","Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, InnovOcean Site,Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","","BIODIVERSITY; STANDARD","Mathematical & Computational Biology","Mathematical & Computational Biology","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0}"

Whereas traits are an enduring characteristic of a species and/or population, a species status may vary geographically and over time. Criteria for selecting traits were that they could be applied to most taxa, were easily available, and their inclusion would result in new research and/or management applications. Numerical traits were favoured over categorical. Habitat was excluded as it can be derived from a selection of these traits.

The flexibility of taxonomic interpretations, however, presents a serious challenge for end-users of taxonomic concepts. Users need standardised and continuously harmonised taxonomic reference systems, as well as high-quality and complete taxonomic data sets, but these are generally lacking for non-specialists. The solution is in dynamic, expertly curated web-based taxonomic tools.The Pan-European Species-directories Infrastructure (PESI) worked to solve this key issue by providing a taxonomic e-infrastructure for Europe. It strengthened the relevant social (expertise) and information (standards, data and technical) capacities of five major community networks on taxonomic indexing in Europe, which is essential for proper biodiversity assessment and monitoring activities. The key objectives of PESI were: 1) standardisation in taxonomic reference systems, 2) enhancement of the quality and completeness of taxonomic data sets and 3) creation of integrated access to taxonomic information.New informationThis paper describes the results of PESI and its future prospects, including the involvement in major European biodiversity informatics initiatives and programs.","de Jong, Y.; Kouwenberg, J.; Boumans, L.; Hussey, C.; Hyam, R.; Nicolson, N.; Kirk, P.; Paton, A.; Michel, E.; Guiry, M.D.; Boegh, P.S.; Pedersen, H.A.; Enghoff, H.; von Raab-Straube, E.; GÃ¼ntsch, A.; Geoffroy, M.; MÃ¼ller, A.; Kohlbecker, A.; Berendsohn, W.; Appeltans, W.; Arvanitidis, C.; Vanhoorne, B.; Declerck, J.; Vandepitte, L.; Hernandez, F.; Nash, R.; Costello, M.J.; Ouvrard, D.; Bezard-Falgas, P.; Bourgoin, T.; Wetzel, F.T.; GlÃ¶ckler, F.; Korb, G.; Ring, C.; Hagedorn, G.; HaÃ¼ser, C.; AktaÃ§, N.; Asan, A.; Ardelean, A.; Vieira Borges, P.A.; Dhora, D.; Khachatryan, H.; Malicky, M.; Ibrahimov, S.; Tuzikov, A.; De Wever, A.; Moncheva, S.; Spassov, N.; Chobot, K.; Popov, A.; Borsic, I.; Sfenthourakis, S.; KÃµljalg, U.; Uotila, P.; Olivier, G.; Dauvin, J.C.; Tarkhnishvili, D.; Chaladze, G.; Tuerkay, M.; Legakis, A.; Peregovits, L.; Gudmundsson, G.A.; Ã“lafsson, E.; Lysaght, L.; Galil, B.S.; Raimondo, F.M.; Domina, G.; Stoch, F.; Minelli, A.; Spungis, V.; Budrys, E.; Olenin, S.; Turpel, A.; Walisch, T.; Krpach, V.; Gambin, M.T.; Ungureanu, L.; Karaman, G.; Kleukers, R.M.

In Europe, seaweed assemblages are highly diverse systems. The combined seaweed flora of different European regions hold around 1550 species (belonging to nearly 500 genera), with new species continuously uncovered, thanks to the emergence of molecular tools. In this manuscript we review the effects of global and local stressors on European seaweeds, their communities, and ecosystem functioning. Following a brief review on the present knowledge on European seaweed diversity and distribution, and the role of seaweed communities in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, we discuss the effects of biotic homogenization (invasive species) and global climate change (shifts in bioclimatic zones and ocean acidification) on the distribution of individual species and their effect on the structure and functioning of seaweed communities. The arrival of new introduced species (that already account for 5â€“10% of the European seaweeds) and the regional extirpation of native species resulting from oceans' climate change are creating new diversity scenarios with undetermined functional consequences. Anthropogenic local stressors create additional disruption often altering dramatically assemblage's structure. Hence, we discuss ecosystem level effects of such stressors like harvesting, trampling, habitat modification, overgrazing and eutrophication that impact coastal communities at local scales. Last, we conclude by highlighting significant knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to anticipate the combined effects of global and local stressors on seaweed communities. With physical and biological changes occurring at unexpected pace, marine phycologists should now integrate and join their research efforts to be able to contribute efficiently for the conservation and management of coastal systems.","Mineur, F.; Arenas, F.; Assis, J.; Davies, A.J.; Engelen, A.H.; Fernandes, F.; Malta, E.-J.; Thibaut, T.; Nguyen, T.; Vaz-Pinto, F.; Vranken, S.; SerrÃ£o, E.A.; De Clerck, O.","WOS:000357146900011","Fernandes, Francisco, F.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2014.11.004","","European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","    Macroalgae; Ecosystem Services; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Biological Invasions; Range Shifts","Journal article","","","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.","North Ireland","Macroalgae; Ecosystem Services; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Biological Invasions; Range Shifts","INTRODUCED JAPANESE MACROALGAE; SARGASSUM-MUTICUM PHAEOPHYTA; RACEMOSA VAR.

The latter allows easy access to experts so they can update the content of the database in a timely fashion. Aphia is the core platform that underpins the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and its more than 80 related global, regional and thematic species databases, but it also allows the storage of non-marine data. The content of Aphia can be consulted online, either by individual users or via machine-to-machine interactions. Aphia uses unique and stable identifiers for each available name in the database through the use of Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs). The system not only allows the storage of accepted and unaccepted names, but it also documents the relationships between names. This makes it a very powerful tool for taxonomic quality control, and also allows the linking of different pieces of information through scientific names, both within the Aphia platform and in relation to externally hosted databases. Through these LSIDs, Aphia has become an important player in the field of (marine) biodiversity informatics, allowing interactions between its own taxonomic data and e.g., biogeographic databases. Some applications in the field of biodiversity informatics encompass the coupling of species traits and taxonomy, as well as the creation of diverse, expert validated data products that can be used by policy makers, for example. Aphia also supplies (part of) its content to other data integrators and the infrastructure can be used to host orphan databases in danger of being lost.","Vandepitte, L.; Vanhoorne, B.; Decock, W.; Dekeyzer, S.; Trias Verbeeck, A.; Bovit, L.; Hernandez, F.; Mees, J.","WOS:000435684900016","Vandepitte, Leen, L.","Flanders Marine Institute/Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee (VLIZ)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/jmse3041448","","Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","",""," Aphia; taxonomy; biodiversity informatics; online database; online editing environment; data rescue; World Register of Marine Species; web services","Journal article","","","Vlaams Inst Zee VLIZ, Flanders Marine Inst, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","Aphia; taxonomy; biodiversity informatics; online database; online editing environment; data rescue; World Register of Marine Species; web services","","Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography","Engineering; Oceanography","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 1.0}"

According to neutral theories of molecular evolution and biodiversity, dispersal limitation of propagules and population stochasticity are integral to shaping both genetic and community structure. We conducted a parallel analysis of biological connectivity at genetic and community levels in marine groups with different dispersal traits. We compiled large data sets of population genetic structure (98 benthic macroinvertebrate and 35 planktonic species) and biogeographic data (2193 benthic macroinvertebrate and 734 planktonic species). We estimated dispersal distances from population genetic data (i.e., FST vs. geographic distance) and from ÃŸ-diversity at the community level. Dispersal distances ranked the biological groups in the same order at both genetic and community levels, as predicted by organism dispersal ability and seascape connectivity: macrozoobenthic species without dispersing larvae, followed by macrozoobenthic species with dispersing larvae and plankton (phyto- and zooplankton). This ranking order is associated with constraints to the movement of macrozoobenthos within the seabed compared with the pelagic habitat. We showed that dispersal limitation similarly determines the connectivity degree of communities and populations, supporting the predictions of neutral theories in marine biodiversity patterns.","Chust, G.; Villarino, E.; Chenuil, A.; Irigoien, X.; Bizsel, N.; Bode, A.; Broms, C.; Claus, S.; FernÃ¡ndez de Puelles, M.L.; Fonda Umani, S.; Hoarau, G.; Mazzocchi, M.G.; Mozetic, P.; Vandepitte, L.; VerÃ­ssimo, H.; Zervoudaki, S.; Borja, A.","WOS:000378516200001","Irigoien, Xabier, X.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep28730","","Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","","Journal article","","","AZTI, Pasaia 20110, Gipuzkoa, Spain.","Spain","","PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; PROPAGULE DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; TIME-SERIES; CONNECTIVITY; DISTANCE","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","Tecnalia - AZTI","x","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 5.0, 'SDG_9': 3.0}"

However, biological research on underwater caves has taken place only in a few areas of the world and relevant information remains fragmented in isolated publications and databases. This fragmentation makes assessing the conservation status of marine cave species especially problematic, and this issue should be addressed urgently given the stresses resulting from planned and rampant development in the coastal zone worldwide. The goal of the World Register of marine Cave Species (WoRCS) initiative is to create a comprehensive taxonomic and ecological database of known species from marine caves and anchialine systems worldwide and to present this as a Thematic Species Database (TSD) of the World Register of marine Species (WoRMS). WoRCS will incorporate ecological data (e.g., type of environment, salinity regimes, and cave zone) as well as geographical information on the distribution of species in cave and anchialine environments. Biodiversity data will be progressively assembled from individual database sources at regional, national or local levels, as well as from literature sources (estimate: >20,000 existing records of cave-dwelling species scattered in several databases). Information will be organized in the WoRCS database following a standard glossary based on existing terminology. Cave-related information will be managed by the WoRCS thematic editors with all data dynamically linked to WoRMS and its team of taxonomic editors. In order to mobilize data into global biogeographic databases, a Gazetteer of the Marine and Anchialine Caves of the World will be established. The presence records of species could be eventually georeferenced for submission to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and constitute an important dataset for biogeographical and climate change studies on marine caves and anchialine systems.","Gerovasileiou, V.; MartÃ­nez, A.; Ãlvarez, F.; Boxshall, G.; Humphreys, W.F.; Jaume, D.; Becking, L.E.; Muricy, G.; van Hengstum, P.J.; Dekeyzer, S.; Decock, W.; Vanhoorne, B.; Vandepitte, L.; Bailly, N.; Iliffe, T.M.","","Bailly, Nicolas, N.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/rio.2.e10451","","European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","Biodiversity","","Marine caves; Anchialine ecosystems; Global species databases; Biodiversity management","Journal article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 7.0, 'SDG_2': 2.0, 'SDG_3': 2.0}"

Therefore, at least part of the Western European population of eels migrates towards the English Channel, in contrast with the Nordic migration route hypothesis.

As a step to defining such efforts, we review current methods of collecting and managing marine biodiversity data. A fundamental component of marine biodiversity is knowing what, where, and when species are present. However, monitoring methods are invariably biased in what taxa, ecological guilds, and body sizes they collect. In addition, the data need to be placed, and/or mapped, into an environmental context. Thus a suite of methods will be needed to encompass representative components of biodiversity in an ecosystem. Some sampling methods can damage habitat and kill species, including unnecessary bycatch. Less destructive alternatives are preferable, especially in conservation areas, such as photography, hydrophones, tagging, acoustics, artificial substrata, light-traps, hook and line, and live-traps. Here we highlight examples of operational international sampling programmes and data management infrastructures, notably the Continuous Plankton Recorder, Reef Life Survey, and detection of Harmful Algal Blooms and MarineGEO. Data management infrastructures include the World Register of Marine Species for species nomenclature and attributes, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System for distribution data, Marine Regions for maps, and Global Marine Environmental Datasets for global environmental data. Existing national sampling programmes, such as fishery trawl surveys and intertidal surveys, may provide a global perspective if their data can be integrated to provide useful information. Less utilised and emerging sampling methods, such as artificial substrata, light-traps, microfossils and eDNA also hold promise for sampling the less studied components of biodiversity. All of these initiatives need to develop international standards and protocols, and long-term plans for their governance and support.","Costello, M.J.; Basher, Z.; McLeod, L.; Asaad, I.; Claus, S.; Vandepitte, L.; Yasuhara, M.; Gislason, H.; Edwards, M.; Appeltans, W.; Enevoldsen, H.; Edgar, G.J.; Miloslavich, P.; De Monte, S.; Pinto, I.S.; Obura, D.; Bates, A.E.","","McLeod, Laura, L.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-319-27288-7_6","","LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","Biodiversity, ""Methods"", ""Monitoring"", ""Sampling""","","","Book chapters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 9.0, 'SDG_2': 3.0, 'SDG_3': 1.0}"

The dynamic nature of the sea caused by waves, boat wakes, and weather conditions poses huge challenges for the development of a stable background model. Moreover, camera motion, reflections, lightning and illumination changes may contribute to false detections. Dynamic background subtraction (DBGS) is widely considered as a solution to tackle this issue in the scope of vessel detection for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, the DBGS techniques suggested for ships are investigated and optimized for the monitoring and tracking of birds in marine video content. In addition to background subtraction, foreground candidates are filtered by a classifier based on their feature descriptors in order to remove non-bird objects.

Since twaite shad is of conservation concern, further knowledge on its migration and reproductive behaviour is needed and acoustic telemetry would be a relevant tool to assess these behaviours. Shads are very sensitive fish showing adverse reactions to handling and anesthesia, specifically twaite shad. Therefore, this species is rather unsuitable for internal implantation of electronic tags, such as acoustic, radio and data storage tags. Preliminary tests are needed to assess the impact of external tagging on twaite shad survival. Here we describe a fish friendly attachment procedure to externally tag the fish. The procedure is quick and may limit additional drag force on swimming as the tags are firmly attached to the body by a rubber plate. This procedure was developed in Belgium in spring 2015 to tag eight shads in the Zeeschelde. Five of these shads showed a migration pattern that generally corresponded with spawning activities observed visually in the river.","Breine, J.; Pauwels, I.; Verhelst, P.; Vandamme, L.; Baeyens, R.; Reubens, J.; Coeck, J.","WOS:000402357600006","Coeck, Johan, J.","Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.003","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Alosa fallax, ""Alosa fallax (LacepÃ¨de, 1803)""","Acoustic telemetry","","Twaite shad; External tagging; Fish migration","Journal article","","","Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Dwersbos 28, B-1630 Linkebeek, Belgium.","Belgium","Twaite shad; Acoustic telemetry; External tagging; Fish migration","TELEMETRY TRANSMITTERS; AMERICAN SHAD; FRESH-WATER; RIVER; FISH; MIGRATION; ESTUARY; L.; MOVEMENT; RECOVERY","Fisheries","Fisheries","INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_3': 1.0, 'SDG_11': 1.0}"

The temporal and spatial scales at which migrations occur and our inability to directly observe these nocturnal movements makes monitoring and characterizing this critical period in migratory animalsâ€™ life cycles difficult. Remote sensing, therefore, has played an important role in our understanding of large-scale nocturnal bird migrations. Weather surveillance radar networks in Europe and North America have great potential for long-term low-cost monitoring of bird migration at scales that have previously been impossible to achieve. Such long-term monitoring, however, poses a number of challenges for the ornithological and ecological communities: how does one take advantage of this vast data resource, integrate information across multiple sensors and large spatial and temporal scales, and visually represent the data for interpretation and dissemination, considering the dynamic nature of migration? We assembled an interdisciplinary team of ecologists, meteorologists, computer scientists, and graphic designers to develop two different flow visualizations, which are interactive and open source, in order to create novel representations of broad-front nocturnal bird migration to address a primary impediment to long-term, largescalenocturnal migration monitoring. We have applied these visualization techniques to mass bird migration events recorded by two different weather surveillance radar networks covering regions in Europe and North America. These applications show the flexibility and portability of such an approach. The visualizations provide an intuitive representation of thescale and dynamics of these complex systems, are easily accessible for a broad interest group, and are biologically insightful. Additionally, they facilitate fundamental ecological research, conservation, mitigation of humanâ€“wildlife conflicts, improvement of meteorological products, and public outreach, education, and engagement.","Shamoun-Baranes, J.; Farnsworth, A.; Aelterman, B.; Alves, J.A.; Azijn, K.; Bernstein, G.; Branco, S.; Desmet, P.; Dokter, A.M.; Horton, K.; Kelling, S.; Kelly, J.F.; Leijnse, H.; Rong, J.; Sheldon, D.; Van den Broeck, W.; Van Den Meersche, J.K.; Van Doren, B.M.; van Gasteren, H.","WOS:000382258100008","Shamoun-Baranes, Judy, J.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0160106","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","","Journal article","","","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Computat Geoecol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","Netherlands","","WESTERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; BIRD MIGRATION; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; WEATHER RADARS; FLIGHT; INFORMATION; WIND; AEROECOLOGY; ECOLOGY; NETWORK","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","University of Amsterdam - Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) - Computational Geoecology","x","Netherlands","","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_3': 5.0, 'SDG_9': 2.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0}"

Although the species has been studied intensively to obtain knowledge to improve management, studies about the resident yellow stage are relatively scarce. In this study, 52 large female yellow eels were tagged with acoustic transmitters in a Belgian polder system and tracked by a network of 23 automatic listening stations. We studied both circadian and seasonal movement patterns and the effect of environmental variables on these patterns. Large female yellow eels were most active at night in late summer and early autumn. A generalised linear mixed model showed that their movement is only slightly influenced by environmental variables. Moreover, as yellow eels show high site fidelity (i.e., the majority was detected only in the habitat type of their catch-release location), they do not encounter many human-induced connectivity problems in polder systems, which makes these systems highly suitable as eel growth habitat. These results can contribute to an effective eel management regarding habitat protection and restoration.","Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Pauwels, I.; Buysse, D.; Aelterman, B.; Van Hoey, S.; Goethals, P.; Moens, T.; Coeck, J.; Mouton, A.","WOS:000417191100042","Reubens, Jan, J.","Flanders Marine Institute","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/eff.12362","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Anguilla anguilla","Acoustic telemetry, ""Movement""","Seasonal","acoustic telemetry, circadian, European eel, movement, movement range, seasonal","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","acoustic telemetry; circadian; European eel; movement; movement range; seasonal","DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; SEASONAL MOVEMENTS; AMERICAN EELS; HABITAT USE; SILVER EEL; SPACE USE; PATTERNS; RIVER; SIZE; DIEL","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_7': 1.0, 'SDG_9': 1.0, 'SDG_15': 1.0}"

This requires biological information on functional and structural species traits such as feeding ecology, body size, reproduction, life history, etc.To accommodate this need, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) (WoRMS Editorial Board 2017) is expanding its content with trait information (Costello et al. 2015), subdivided into 3 main categories: (1) taxonomy related traits, e.g. paraphyletic groups, (2) biological and ecological traits-specific characteristics of a taxon, e.g. body size or feeding type and (3) human defined traits, e.g. the legal protection status of species, whether a species is introduced, harmful, or used as an ecological indicator.Initially, priority was given to the inclusion of traits that could be applied to the majority of marine taxa and where the information was easily available. The main driver for this approach was that the inclusion of these traits should result in new research, which in turn would drive improvements in the quality and quantity of trait information. Pilot projects were carried out for different species groups, allowing a thorough documentation of a selection of traits. In parallel, a standard vocabulary was put together (http://www.marinespecies.org/traits/wiki/), based on already existing resources to cover all marine life. All documented traits needed to be compliant with this vocabulary, in order to make the data as widely useable as possible, across groups. Defining a trait across all marine life is not trivial, as scientists can use terms in a different way between groups. This stresses the importance for users to realize these differences in terminology, before they analyse a trait across all taxa.Some traits were thought to be quite straightforward to document, although practice proved otherwise. Such a trait is body size, where the aim was to document the numerical value of the â€˜maximum body size in lengthâ€™. In reality, a lot of variation is possible (e.g. for fish: fork length versus standard length) and maximum size is not always considered relevant from an ecological point of view. On the other hand, documenting numerical body size for each marine species is quite time consuming. Therefore, a complementary size trait will be documented, indicating whether taxa are considered as micro, meio, macro or mega.Whereas the initial approach was to complete the register for each tackled trait relevant for all marine species, we now complement this by (1) documenting several traits within a specific group, regardless whether this trait is also present in other taxon groups, and (2) documenting one specific trait, covering a variety â€“ but not all â€“ taxonomic groups, e.g. the composition of the skeleton for calcareous animals.Where possible, we aim to document a trait on a higher taxonomic level to allow the work to progress more rapidly. As the database allows top-down inheritance of traits, exceptions can easily be documented. In addition, collaborations are sought with already running initiatives such as Encyclopedia of Life.Very soon, all the documented traits will be searchable through the Marine Species Traits Portal. The human-defined traits are already accessible through the EMODnet Biology Portal (http://www.emodnet-biology.eu/toolbox), in combination with distribution information from the European Ocean Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS; www.eurobis.org; Vandepitte et al. 2011; Vandepitte et al. 2015) and taxonomy from WoRMS (www.marinespecies.org). Through the LifeWatch Taxonomic Backbone (LW-TaxBB) (http://www.lifewatch.be/data-services/), services are offered to access these traits, combined with data and information from other resources such as WoRMS and (Eur)OBIS.We would like to acknowledge the EMODnet Biology and the LifeWatch project, in which the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) â€“ host institute of WoRMS â€“ is responsible for the development of the LW-TaxBB. Both projects provide funding for the documentation of trait data and development of services allowing researchers to easily access the available data, in combination with data from other sources.","Vandepitte, L.; Claus, S.; Dekeyzer, S.; Vranken, S.; Decock, W.; Vanhoorne, B.; Hernandez, F.","","Claus, Simon, S.","Flanders Marine Institute/Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee (VLIZ)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20337","","EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","species traits, marine biodiversity, LifeWatch Taxonomic Backbone, World Register of Marine Species","Journal article","","","","","","","","","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 3.0, 'SDG_3': 1.0, 'SDG_9': 1.0}"

A better understanding of fish migration behaviour in relation to these barriers is needed to take proper mitigation actions. We investigated the impact of migration barriers on downstream migrating European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>L.) by tracking 50 acoustically tagged eels between July 2012 and March 2015 in a Belgian polder area. The study area was selected due to the presence of a wide range of migration barriers, such as two pumping stations, a weir and tidal sluices. These structures regulate the water level, resulting in discontinuous flow conditions. The results showed that migration was primarily nocturnal and discharge appeared to be the main trigger for migration in the polder. We also observed substantial delays and exploratory behaviour near barriers. Delays can have a serious impact on eels since their energy resources are limited for a successful <i>trans</i>-Atlantic migration. In addition, delays and exploratory behaviour can also increase predation and disease risk. The obtained knowledge can contribute to efficient management such as improved fish passage and guidance solutions.","Verhelst, P.; Buysse, D.; Reubens, J.; Pauwels, I.; Aelterman, B.; Van Hoey, S.; Goethals, P.; Coeck, J.; Moens, T.; Mouton, A.M.","WOS:000423638800028","Verhelst, Pieterjan, P.","Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Aquatic Ecology, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.10.018","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Anguilla anguilla","Telemetry","","European eel; Migration; Freshwater; Estuary; Migration barriers","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","European eel; Migration; Freshwater; Estuary; Telemetry; Migration barriers","ADULT CHINOOK SALMON; SILVER EELS; AMERICAN EELS; MOVEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; RIVER; MORTALITY; COLUMBIA; PASSAGE; PHASE","Fisheries","Fisheries","Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Animal sciences and aquatic ecology - Environmental Toxicology Unit (GhEnToxLab)","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_3': 3.0, 'SDG_6': 1.0, 'SDG_9': 1.0}"

Unfortunately, these criteria are rarely met for marine organisms for which distributions are too often only scantly characterized and absences generally not recorded. Here, we investigate predictor relevance as a function of modelling algorithms and settings for a global dataset of marine species.Location: Global marine.Methods: We selected well-studied and identifiable species from all major marine taxonomic groups. Distribution records were compiled from public sources (e.g., OBIS, GBIF, Reef Life Survey) and linked to environmental data from Bio-ORACLE and MARSPEC. Using this dataset, predictor relevance was analysed under different variations of modelling algorithms, numbers of predictor variables, cross-validation strategies, sampling bias mitigation methods, evaluation methods and ranking methods. SDMs for all combinations of predictors from eight correlation groups were fitted and ranked, from which the top five predictors were selected as the most relevant. Results: We collected two million distribution records from 514 species across 18 phyla. Mean sea surface temperature and calcite are, respectively, the most relevant and irrelevant predictors. A less clear pattern was derived from the other predictors. The biggest differences in predictor relevance were induced by varying the number of predictors, the modelling algorithm and the sample selection bias correction. The distribution data and associated environmental data are made available through the R package marinespeed and at http://marinespeed.org.Main conclusions: While temperature is a relevant predictor of global marine species distributions, considerable variation in predictor relevance is linked to the SDM set-up. We promote the usage of a standardized benchmark dataset (MarineSPEED) for methodological SDM studies.","Bosch, S.; Tyberghein, L.; Deneudt, K.; Hernandez, F.; De Clerck, O.","WOS:000419339800002","Bosch, Samuel, S.","Research Group Phycology, Biology Department, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12668","","Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","Marine","","benchmark dataset; ecological niche modelling; spatial cross-validation; species distribution modelling; variable importance ","Journal article","","","Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","benchmark dataset; ecological niche modelling; marine; spatial cross-validation; species distribution modelling; variable importance","SAMPLING BIAS; CROSS-VALIDATION; PSEUDO-ABSENCES; SELECTION BIAS; IMPROVE; RANKING; COASTAL; REDUCE; WORLD; WIDE","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Phycology","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_13': 2.0, 'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 2.0}"

In this study, we compared porpoise detections before, during and after pile driving. During piling, porpoise detections decreased at stations located up to 20 km from the location of the piling event.

To interpret acoustic data correctly, understanding influencing factors on the detection probability is critical. Therefore, range test studies are an essential part of acoustic telemetry research. Here, we investigated whether specific environmental factors (i.e. wind, currents, waves, background noise, receiver tilt and azimuth) influence the receiver detection probability for a permanent acoustic receiver network in Belgium. Noise and wind speed in relation to distance, the interaction of receiver tilt and azimuth and current speed were the most influential variables affecting the detection probability in this environment.

Nevertheless, most species distribution models (SDMs) still focus solely on environment-species relationships to predict the occurrence of species. Furthermore, the currently used indirect estimates of movement allow to assess habitat accessibility, but do not provide an accurate description of movement. Better proxies of movement are needed to assess the dispersal potential of individual species and to gain a more practical insight in the interconnectivity of communities. Telemetry techniques are rapidly evolving and highly capable to provide explicit descriptions of movement, but their usefulness for SDMs will mainly depend on the ability of these models to deal with hitherto unconsidered ecological processes. More specifically, the integration of movement is likely to affect the environmental data requirements as the connection between environmental and biological data is crucial to provide reliable results. Mobility implies the occupancy of a continuum of space, hence an adequate representation of both geographical and environmental space is paramount to study mobile species distributions. In this context, environmental models, remote sensing techniques and animal-borne environmental sensors are discussed as potential techniques to obtain suitable environmental data. In order to provide an in-depth review of the aforementioned methods, we have chosen to use the modelling of fish distributions as a case study. The high mobility of fish and the often highly variable nature of the aquatic environment generally complicate model development, making it an adequate subject for research. Furthermore, insight into the distribution of fish is of great interest for fish stock assessments and water management worldwide, underlining its practical relevance.","Bruneel, S.; Gobeyn, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.","WOS:000432462000092","Reubens, Jan, J.","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.026","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","Telemetry","","Species distributions; Fish movement; Environmental data collection","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Species distributions; Fish movement; Environmental data collection; Telemetry","CORAL-REEF FISHES; PIKE ESOX-LUCIUS; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; MECHANISTIC MODELS; UNDERWATER VIDEO; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; NEXT-GENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 2.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0}"

Yet given the complexity of polar marine ecosystems, predicting the mode, direction and extent of these consequences remains challenging. Trait-based approaches are increasingly adopted as a tool by which to explore changes in functioning, but trait information is largely absent for the high latitudes. Some understanding of traitâ€“function relationships can be gathered from studies at lower latitudes, but given the uniqueness of polar ecosystems it is questionable whether these relationships can be directly transferred. Here we discuss the challenges of using trait-based approaches in polar regions and present a roadmap of how to overcome them by following six interlinked steps: (1) forming an active, international research network, (2) standardizing terminology and methodology, (3) building and crosslinking trait databases, (4) conducting coordinated trait-function experiments, (5) implementing traits into models, and finally, (6) providing advice to management and stakeholders. The application of trait-based approaches in addition to traditional species-based methods will enable us to assess the effects of rapid ongoing changes on the functioning of marine polar ecosystems. Implementing our roadmap will make these approaches more easily accessible to a broad community of users and consequently aid understanding of the future polar oceans.","Degen, R.; Aune, M.; Bluhm, B.A.; Cassidy, C.; Kedra, M.; Kraan, C.; Vandepitte, L.; Wlodarska-Kowalczuk, M.; Zhulay, I.; Albano, P.G.; Bremner, J.; Grebmeier, J.M.; Link, H.; Morata, N.; NordstrÃ¶m, M.C.; Shojaei, M.G.; Sutton, L.; Zuschin, M.","WOS:000444520600071","Albano, Paolo, P.G.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.04.050","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","Functional traits;  Marine;  Polar regions;  Climate change;  Ecosystem functioning;  Trait database","Journal article","","","Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Riooceanog, Vienna, Austria.","Austria","Functional traits; Marine; Polar regions; Climate change; Ecosystem functioning; Trait database","MACOMA-BALTHICA COMMUNITY; FUNCTIONAL-GROUP APPROACH; SPECIES TRAITS; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; LIFE-HISTORY; BARENTS SEA; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BENTHIC FAUNA; ECOLOGICAL TRAITS","Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","University of Vienna - Department of Limnology and Biooceanography","x","","","","","OK","{'SDG_9': 1.0, 'SDG_11': 1.0}"

For terrestrial environments, WorldClim has served this purpose since 2005, but equivalent marine data only became available in 2012, with pioneer initiatives like Bio-ORACLE providing data layers for several ecologically relevant variables. Currently, the available marine data packages have not yet been updated to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions nor to present times, and are mostly restricted to the top surface layer of the oceans, precluding the modelling of a large fraction of the benthic diversity that inhabits deeper habitats. To address this gap, we present a significant update of Bio-ORACLE for new future climate scenarios, present-day conditions and benthic layers (near sea bottom). The reliability of data layers was assessed using a cross-validation framework against in situ quality-controlled data. This test showed a generally good agreement between our data layers and the global climatic patterns. We also provide a package of functions in the R software environment (sdmpredictors) to facilitate listing, extraction and management of data layers and allow easy integration with the available pipelines for bioclimatic modelling.

Because the use of shipping canals by, and their effects on, migrating fish remain unknown, we assessed whether these canals can play a significant role in the migration of the critically endangered European eel. Only one third of 70 acoustically tagged silver eels completed migration through a shipping canal, and did so at a very low pace (average <0.06â€¯mâ€¯s<sup>-1</sup>) due to delays at shipping locks and most likely also due to the disruption of water flow. These delays may come at an energetic cost, hampering the chances of successful migration. Knowledge on the impact of shipping canals on diadromous fish is crucial for proper management regulations. For instance, the observation that eels mostly migrated at night and during spring and autumn can support water managers to define adequate measures to improve eel migration in shipping canals.","Verhelst, P.; Baeyens, R.; Reubens, J.; Benitez, J.-P.; Coeck, J.; Goethals, P.L.M.; Ovidio, M.; Vergeynst, J.; Moens, T.; Mouton, A.M.","WOS:000438005100017","Benitez, Jean-Phillippe, J.-P.","Laboratory of Fish Demography and Hydroecology, UR FOCUS, University of LiÃ¨ge","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.05.013","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","Diadromous; Canal; Migration; Water regulation; Shipping locks","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Diadromous; Canal; Migration; Water regulation; Shipping locks","DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; FRESH-WATER; SPAWNING MIGRATION; RIVER MEUSE; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; SEA; CONSERVATION; HYDROPOWER; ESCAPEMENT","Fisheries","Fisheries","University of LiÃ¨ge - Faculty of Sciences - Department of Sciences and Management of the Environment - Laboratory of Fish Demography and Hydroecology","x","Belgium","","University","Science","OK","{'SDG_9': 1.0, 'SDG_14': 1.0, 'SDG_15': 1.0}"

Changes in this community may impact a wide range of species (Capuzzo et al. 2018) ranging from zooplankton and fish to seabirds and marine mammals. Efficient monitoring of the phytoplankton community is therefore essential (Edwards et al. 2002). Traditional monitoring techniques are highly time intensive and involve taxonomists identifying and counting numerous specimens under the light microscope. With the recent development of automated sampling devices, image analysis technologies and learning algorithms, the rate of counting and identification of phytoplankton can be increased significantly (Thyssen et al. 2015). The FlowCAM (Ãlvarez et al. 2013) is an imaging particle analysis system for the identification and classification of phytoplankton. Within the Belgian Lifewatch observatory, monthly phytoplankton samples are taken at nine stations in the Belgian part of the North Sea. These samples are run through the FlowCAM and each particle is photographed. Next, the particles are identified based on their morphology (and fluorescence) using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision. This procedure requires learning sets of expert validated images. The CNNs are specifically designed to take advantage of the two dimensional structure of these images by finding local patterns, being easier to train and having many fewer parameters than a fully connected network with the same number of hidden units.In this work we present our approach to the use of CNNs for the identification and classification of phytoplankton, testing it on several benchmarks and comparing with previous classification techniques. The network architecture used is ResNet50 (He et al. 2016). The framework is fully written in Python using the TensorFlow (Abadi, M. et al. 2016) module for Deep Learning.Deployment and exploitation of the current framework is supported by the recently started European Union Horizon 2020 programme funded project DEEP-Hybrid-Datacloud (Grant Agreement number 777435), which supports the expensive training of the system needed to develop the application and provides the necessary computational resources to the users.","Lloret, L.; Heredia, I.; Aguilar, F.; Debusschere, E.; Deneudt, K.; Hernandez, F.","","Deneudt, Klaas, K.","Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.2.25762","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","deep learning; phytoplankton; Convolutional Neural Networks; identification; machine learning; classification","Journal article","","","","","","","","","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_9': 3.0, 'SDG_11': 3.0, 'SDG_14': 3.0}"

Optimized plankton imaging, clustering and visualization workflows through integrative data management and application of artificial intelligence. <i>Geophys. Res. Abstr. 20(EGU2018-14458)</i>","Phytoplankton is a diverse group of photosynthesizing organisms which account for approximately fifty percent of the primary production on Earth. Increasing our knowledge on phytoplankton dynamics (and plankton in general) is therefore of major importance. In the present research, we aimed to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of the phyto- and zooplankton community in the Eastern English Channel, Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Thames estuary. To do so, we organized a JERICO-NEXT Lifewatch cruise in May 2017 on board of the RV Simon Stevin and sampled 44 stations, involving five research institutions from France (CNRS-LOG,), The Netherlands (RWS, NIOZ) and Belgium (UGENT, VLIZ). To quantify the biomass of the phytoplankton community we used a unique combination of three flow cytometers and two Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometerss that were coupled to the underway ferrybox system. These observations were complemented with Water Insight Spectrometer and water profile data (by means of a CTD) and samples for zooplankton, pigment and nutrient analysis. A dedicated data workshop was organized with all partners to conduct a joint analysis on both the biotic and abiotic data. A first exploration of the data, by means of regression-based models and multivariate statistics, suggested that mainly nutrient discharges from the rivers influence the plankton structure. Furthermore, water turbidity is controlling photosynthetic activity and horizontal and vertical variations of photosynthetic properties can be discriminated.","Debusschere, E.; Mortelmans, J.; Tyberghein, L.; Artigas, L.F.; Creach, V.; de Blok, R.; Everaert, G.; Kromkamp, J.; Lizon, F.; Louchart, A.; Rijkeboer, M.; Deneudt, K.","","Louchart, Arnaud, A.","","","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","","Journal article","Summary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 3.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0, 'SDG_6': 1.0}"

Here, biodiversity was valued using an ecological approach based on the intrinsic value incorporated in biodiversity per se, regardless of any human association. The Marine Biological Valuation protocol was drawn upon the methodology of terrestrial valuation maps, to support the European MSFD environmental status assessment (descriptor 1 â€“ biodiversity) and national marine spatial planning approaches. To apply the protocol on the Portuguese continental shelf we compiled and analyzed national biological databases for a wide taxonomic range of ecosystem components (seabirds, demersal fish, macrobenthos, marine mammals and sea turtles) and assessed the spatial overlap with existing and proposed conservation areas (Natura 2000 network). The resultant maps described patterns of biological value consistent with the physical and biological oceanographic conditions as well as local hydrodynamics of the Portuguese continental shelf. The results of our approach confirm previously identified valuable areas for protection (particularly in the northern and central regions), but also highlights the value of currently unprotected sites, mainly in the southern region. Biological valuation maps showed to be comprehensive tool to compile and spatially analyze biological datasets. By drawing attention to subzones of biological importance, it constitutes a valuable instrument in making appropriate-scale decisions on the spatial allocation of human activities in the context of the Portuguese marine spatial planning, currently facing the pressure and impacts of increased maritime exploitation.","Gomes, I.; PÃ©rez-Jorge, S.; Peteiro, L.; Andrade, J.; Bueno-Pardo, J.; Quintino, V.; Rodrigues, A.M.; Azevedo, M.; Vanreusel, A.; Queiroga, H.; Deneudt, K.; Gomes, I.","WOS:000452692600054","PÃ©rez-Jorge, Sergi, S.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.05.040","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","Assessment tool; Intrinsic value; Biodiversity; Ecolical criteria; Conservation; Marine spatial planning ","Journal article","","","Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.","Portugal","Assessment tool; Intrinsic value; Biodiversity; Ecological criteria; Conservation; Marine spatial planning","ECONOMIC VALUATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA; PROTECTED AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; RESERVES; IMPACTS; CONTEXT; SPACE; BAY","Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","University of Aveiro - Department of Biology","x","Portugal","","University","Science","OK","{'SDG_3': 5.0, 'SDG_2': 4.0, 'SDG_11': 4.0}"

In Europe, this community lacks a formal network structure. The aim of this study is to review the use of acoustic telemetry in Europe and document the contribution of cross-boundary studies and inter-research group collaborations. Based on this, we explore the potential benefits and challenges of a network approach to identify future priorities and best practices for aquatic biotelemetry research in Europe.Results: Over the past decade, there was an approximately sevenfold increase in the number of acoustic telemetry studies published on marine and diadromous species in Europe compared to a sixfold increase globally. Over 90% of these studies were conducted on fishes and undertaken in coastal areas, estuaries, or rivers. 75% of these studies were conducted by researchers based in one of five nations (Norway, UK, France, Portugal, and Spain) and, even though 34% were based on collaborations between scientists from several countries, there was only one study with an acoustic receiver array that extended beyond the borders of a single country. In recent years, acoustic telemetry in European waters has evolved from studying behavioural aspects of animals (82.2%), into more holistic approaches addressing management-related issues (10%), tagging methods and effects (5%), and technology and data analysis development (2.8%).Conclusions: Despite the increasing number of publications and species tracked, there is a prominent lack of planned and structured acoustic telemetry collaborations in Europe. A formal pan-European network structure would promote the development of (1) a research platform that could benefit the acoustic telemetry community through capacity building, (2) a centralized database, and (3) key deployment sites and studies on priority species requiring research in Europe. A network may increase efficiency, expand the scope of research that can be undertaken, promote European science integration, enhance the opportunities and success of acquiring research funding and, ultimately, foster regional and transatlantic collaborations. It may also help address research priorities such as the large-scale societal challenges arising from climate change impacts and assist the EUâ€™s Marine Strategy Framework Directive via identification of good environmental status of endangered or commercially important species.","Abecasis, D.; Steckenreuter, A.; Reubens, J.; Aarestrup, K.; AlÃ³s, J.; Badalamenti, F.; Bajona, L.; Boylan, P.; Deneudt, K.; Greenberg, L.; BrevÃ©, N.; Hernandez, F.; Humphries, N.; Meyer, C.; Sims, D.W.; Thorstad, E.B.; Walker, A.M.; Whoriskey, F.; Afonso, P.","","Steckenreuter, Andre, A.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40317-018-0156-0","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","European tracking network; Acoustic telemetry; Flagship species; Acoustic arrays; Animal movement; Spatio-temporal movement; Biotelemetry","Journal article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_9': 1.0, 'SDG_11': 1.0}"

On average, over the 20 nights and all sites, 389 birds passed per 1 km transect per hour. The night with highest migration intensity showed an average of 1 621 birds per km per hour passing the radar stations, but there was considerable geographical and temporal variation in migration intensity. The highest intensity of migration was seen in central France. The overall migration directions showed strong southwest components. Migration dynamics were strongly related to synoptic wind conditions. A windâ€related mass migration event occurred immediately after a change in wind conditions, but quickly diminished even when supporting winds continued to prevail.

These morphs are mainly considered the result of a differential food choice, with narrow heads feeding primarily on small/soft prey and broad heads on large/hard prey. Yet, such a classification implies that head-width variation follows a bimodal distribution, leading to the assumption of disruptive selection. We investigated the head morphology of 272 eels, caught over three consecutive years (2015-2017) at a single location in the Zeeschelde (Belgium). Based on our results, BIC favored a unimodal distribution, while AIC provided equal support for a unimodal and a bimodal distribution. Notably, visualization of the distributions revealed a strong overlap between the two normal distributions under the bimodal model, likely explaining the ambiguity under AIC. Consequently, it is more likely that head-width variation followed a unimodal distribution, indicating there are no disruptive selection pressures for bimodality in the Zeeschelde. As such, eels could not be divided in two distinct head-width groups. Instead, their head widths showed a continuum of narrow to broad with a normal distribution. This pattern was consistent across all maturation stages studied here.","Verhelst, P.; De Meyer, J.; Reubens, J.; Coeck, J.; Goethals, P.; Moens, T.; Mouton, A.M.","WOS:000452327000003","De Meyer, Jens, J.","Evolutionary Morphology of Vertebrates, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.5773","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Anguilla anguilla","Speed, ""Telemetry""","Condition","Maturation stages; Head dimorphism; Disruptive selection; Condition; European eel; Unimodality; Bimodality  ","Journal article","","","Flanders Marine Inst, Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","Maturation stages; Head dimorphism; Telemetry; Speed; Disruptive selection; Condition; European eel; Unimodality; Bimodality","FRESH-WATER; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; SALINITY PREFERENCE; SHAPE; HABITAT; GROWTH; ECOMORPHOLOGY; POLYMORPHISM; BIMODALITY; PLASTICITY","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Evolutionary morphology of vertebrates","","Belgium","x","University","Science","OK","{'SDG_7': 1.0}"

The scheme, including the mandatory metadata fields and standardization, can be used as a guideline for future projects. Inventories of datasources, projects and data-originators were compiled and the final datasets are available via the central dataportal. Even after compiling and quality checking the long-term datasets, the scientists had to consider some limitations, like changing methodologies and low data resolution, and incorporate these into their trend analyses procedures. Some remarkable environmental changes over time were observed. Model results of the contaminants showed decreasing trends for heavy metals and PCBs. Zn concentrations, however, were found increasing in marine sediments while As concentrations were found increasing in groyne mussels. Nearby the port of Zeebrugge and the mouth of the Scheldt, PCB concentrations were found slightly increasing again over the last decade. The study on eutrophication showed that nutrient (N, P) riverine concentrations and loads have decreased continuously from the end of the 1980â€Ÿs to now. However, this did not result in a comparable decrease of marine nutrient concentrations. No clear long-term trend effect was observed on in situ chlorophyll a concentrations following the nutrient decrease. However, a clear change in chlorophyll a phenology followed the increase in sea surface temperature in the period. Furthermore, biomass, seasonality and structure of diatom and dinoflagellate communities were compared between the 1970s and 2000s for the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS), derived from the newly established Belgian Phytoplankton Database. Distinct changes were observed: changes in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass and shift of fulcrum; changes in community structure, with a trend towards seasonal homogenization in the diatom community; increased occurrence of harmful diatom (Pseudo-nitzschia) and dinoflagellate (e.g. Prorocentrum) genera. The observed changes correlate well with overall increases in temperature and changes in nutrient loads and ratios.And finally, for acidification, pH data reveal an increasing trend from the mid-70â€Ÿs to the mid-80â€Ÿs and a decrease of pH from the mid-80â€Ÿs onwards that seems consistent with changes in primary production patterns. The comparison of CH4 concentrations obtained in 1990 and 2016, showed a decreasing trend consistent with alleviation of eutrophication in the area.Based on the outcome of this successful project, the partners defined various recommendations regarding future monitoring strategies for policy makers.","Lagring, R.; De Witte, B.; Bekaert, K.; Borges, A.V.; Desmit, X.; Le, H.M.; Nohe, A.; Sabbe, K.; Strobbe, F.; Tyberghein, L.; Vandenberghe, T.; Van der Zande, D.","","Borges, Alberto, A.V.","Ulg","","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","Contamination, ""Eutrophication""","","ocean acidification; Southern North Sea; long-term trends","Reports","Final report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_14': 10.0, 'SDG_13': 2.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0}"

These data types support international policies and directives, needed for species and habitat conservation. As aquatic systems are highly interconnected and cross administrative borders, optimal data gathering should be organized on a large scale. This need triggered the development of regional, national and international aquatic animal tracking network initiatives around the globe. In Belgium, a national acoustic receiver network for fish tracking, called the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network, was set up in 2014 with different research institutes collaborating. It is a permanent network with 160 acoustic receivers and since the start, over 800 animals from 16 different fish species have been tagged and generated more than 17 million detections so far. To handle all the (meta)data generated, a data management platform was built. The central database stores all the data and has an interactive web interface that allows the users to upload, manage and explore (meta)data. In addition, the database is linked to an R-shiny application to allow the user to visualize and download the detection data. The permanent tracking network is not only a collaborative platform for exchange of data, analysis tools, devices and knowledge. It also creates opportunities to perform feasibility studies and Ph.D. studies in a cost-efficient way. The Belgian tracking network is a first step towards a Pan-European aquatic tracking network.

Since that time, OBIS has expanded its goals beyond simply hosting data to supporting more aspects of marine conservation (Pooter et al. 2017). In order to accomplish those goals, the OBIS secretariat in partnership with its European node (EurOBIS) hosted at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ, Belgium), and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Committee on International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE, 23rd session, March 2015, Brugge) established a 2-year pilot project to address a particularly problematic issue that environmental data collected as part of marine biological research were being disassociated from the biological data. OBIS-Event-Data is the solution that was developed from that pilot project, which devised a method for keeping environmental data together with the biological data (Pooter et al. 2017). OBIS is seeking early adopters of the new data standard OBIS-Event-Data from among the marine biodiversity monitoring communities, to further validate the data standard, and develop data products and scientific applications to support the enhancement of Biological and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in the framework of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO BON MBON). After the successful 2-year IODE pilot project OBIS-ENV-DATA, the IOC established a new 2-year IODE pilot project OBIS-Event-Data for Scientific Applications (2017-2019). The OBIS-Event-Data data standard, building on Darwin Core, provides a technical solution for combined biological and environmental data, and incorporates details about sampling methods and effort, including event hierarchy. It also implements standardization of parameters involved in biological, environmental, and sampling details using an international standard controlled vocabulary (British Oceanographic Data Centre Natural Environment Research Council). A workshop organized by IODE/OBIS in April brought together major animal tagging and tracking networks such as the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), the Animal Telemetry Network (ATN), the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the European Tracking Network (ETN) and the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP) to test the OBIS-Event- Data standard through the development of some data products and science applications. Additionally, this workshop contributes to the further maturation of the GOOS EOV on fish as well as the EOV on birds, mammals and turtles.

However, the impact of navigation locks on downstream migrating fish is rarely documented. In Belgium, the Albert Canal connecting the Meuse River to the Scheldt Estuary may offer migration opportunities for European eel (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) and Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>), two critically endangered species. During their downstream migration phase (respectively silver eels and salmon smolts), both species have to pass five intermediate-head navigation locks before reaching the estuary. Previous research showed that silver eel escapement is largely unsuccessful and that eels are delayed extensively at the navigation lock complexes. To get a better understanding of the mechanisms behind these failures and delays, we tagged and released 62 silver eels and 44 salmon smolts in the vicinity of one navigation lock complex of the canal. This paper reports the mechanisms behind the previously perceived delay, the route choices to pass the complex, and the risks involved. Of the 65% tagged eels and 73% tagged smolts that succeeded to pass the complex, respectively, 20% and 41% needed more than one trial to pass the complex. Moreover, 52% of all trials were via intakes of the lock filling system, at least four smolts (17%) died after intake passing, and about 30% of both intake-passing smolts and eels stopped migrating after passage. Therefore, intermediate-head navigation locks are a potential threat to downstream migrating fish, which requires more research to fully investigate its impact.","Vergeynst, J.; Pauwels, I.; Baeyens, R.; Coeck, J.; Nopens, I.; De Mulder, T.; Mouton, A.","WOS:000461064400003","Vergeynst, Jenna, J.","BIOMATH, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/rra.3403","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","Anguilla anguilla, ""Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758""","","European eel","Atlantic salmon; downstream fish migration; European eel;  fish-friendliness; navigation locks","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, BIOMATH Model Based Anal & Optimisat Bioproc, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Atlantic salmon; downstream fish migration; European eel; fish-friendliness; navigation locks","ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; SILVER EEL; WATER","Environmental Sciences; Water Resources","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources","Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling - BIOMATH","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_15': 2.0, 'SDG_16': 1.0}"

The networks are a GPS tracking network for large birds, an acoustic receiver network for fish, and a camera trap network for mammals. As part of our mission at the Open science lab for biodiversity, we are publishing the machine observations these networks generate as standardized, open data. One of the challenges however, is finding the appropriate standards and platforms to do so.In this talk, we will present the three networks, the type of biologging data they collect and how we (plan to) standardize these to specific community standards and to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012). Data from the bird tracking network have been published in 2014 as one of the first biologging datasets on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Stienen et al. 2014). We are now planning to upload the data to Movebank instead and contribute to a generic mapping between the Movebank format and Darwin Core. Data from the acoustic receiver network are being mapped using the Darwin Core guidelines proposed by the Machine Observations Interest Group of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). Images generated by the camera trap network are managed in the annotation system Agouti, for which we plan to export the data in the Camera Trap Metadata Language (Forrester et al. 2016). We also aim to write a software package to deposit camera trap images and data on Zenodo and map the observation data to Darwin Core.We hope that our work will contribute to discussions and guidelines on how to best map biologging data to Darwin Core, which is one of the aims of the Machine Observations Interest Group of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).","Desmet, P.; Van Hoey, S.; Reyserhove, L.; Brosens, D.; Oldoni, D.; Milotic, T.","","Reyserhove, Lien, L.","Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.3.37413","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","LifeWatch, sensors, biologging, camera traps, acoustic telemetry, GPS tracking, Darwin Core","Journal article","Summary","","","","","","","","INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_15': 4.0, 'SDG_9': 1.0}"

This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites, a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the â€œStrength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)â€ approach. We also identify ways in which the <i>in situ</i> parameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximize their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations.","Muelbert, J.H.; Nidzieko, N.J.; Acosta, A.T.R.; Beaulieu, S.E.; Bernardino, A.F.; Boikova, E.; Bornman, T.G.; Cataletto, B.; Deneudt, K.; Eliason, E.; Kraberg, A.; Nakaoka, M.; Pugnetti, A.; Ragueneau, O.; Scharfe, M.; Soltwedel, T.; Sosik, H.M.; Stanisci, A.; Stefanova, K.; StÃ©phan, P.; Stier, A.; Wikner, J.; Zingone, A.","WOS:000482977400001","Zingone, Adriana, A.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00527","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","climate change; marine ecosystems; ecology; EOVs; SWOT; DEIMS","Journal article","","","Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine Sci & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.","Australia","climate change; marine ecosystems; ecology; EOVs; SWOT; DEIMS","IN-SITU; ECOSYSTEM; SENSOR","Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","University of Tasmania - Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS)","x","Australia","","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 2.0, 'SDG_3': 1.0}"

The North Sea Open Science Conference organised by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform in 2016 aimed to take stock of the present-day scientific knowledge on the North Sea ecosystem, its interactions with human activities and its management. The conference was structured along three themes: (1) â€˜the scientific backbone of the North Sea ecosystem: adequacy of the knowledge base?â€™, (2) â€˜A new era in environmental monitoring and assessment: what is at stake?â€™, and (3) â€˜Sustainability: one for all, all for one?â€™. Focusing on â€˜open scienceâ€™, we welcomed about 200 participants from around the North Sea with different backgrounds and interests in environmental sciences. The participants were challenged to reflect on current and future challenges for the North Sea management and, in particular, to explore possible nature-friendly solutions for addressing these challenges during a series of introductory oral (69) and poster (59) presentations, and World CafÃ© and Fish Bowl participatory sessions. The participants agreed on six main actions to (1) provide a solid scientific base for marine management decisions; (2) develop society-driven research; (3) increase interdisciplinary science; (4) recognise the need for system knowledge; (5) improve communication, knowledge exchange, and collective implementation of scientific knowledge; and (6) build integrated knowledge bases.

We found a significant decrease in the number of GPS fixes of flying birds from up to a distance of at least 2000m towards the middle of the wind farm. Non-flying birds showed a similar avoidance of the wind farm interior, yet presence strongly peaked right at the wind farmâ€™s edge, demonstrated to represent gulls perching on the outer turbine jacket foundations. The findings of this study reveal a strong within wind farm variability in bird density, a most crucial parameter in collision risk modelling. The method presented here is straightforward and similar studies conducted at other wind farm sites on a range of large gull species (<i>Larus</i> sp.) would allow to assess the potential and species specific variation in meso-scale response patterns and to gain insight in the underlying ecological incentives, which in turn would provide widely applicable and much-needed input for (cumulative) collision impact assessments.","Vanermen, N.; Courtens, W.; Daelemans, R.; Lens, L.; MÃ¼ller, W.; Van de walle, M.; Verstraete, H.; Stienen, E.","WOS:000536430100022","Lens, Luc, L.","Terrestrial Ecological Unit (TEREC), Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icesjms/fsz199","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","avoidance; collision risk; GPS telemetry; impact assessment; lesserblack-backed gull; offshore wind farm","Journal article","","","Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Havenlaan 88 Box 73, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.","Belgium","avoidance; collision risk; GPS telemetry; impact assessment; lesser black-backed gull; offshore wind farm","MARINE BIRD POPULATIONS; HARNESS ATTACHMENT; LARUS-FUSCUS; MODELS; SEABIRDS; DISCARDS","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC) ","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_6': 1.0, 'SDG_7': 1.0, 'SDG_9': 1.0}"

Since the 1970s, both increases and decreases in phytoplankton biomass and production have been reported from different parts of the North Sea. Such conflicting observations may be partly caused by methodological differences, but also reflect regional differences related to bathymetry, hydrodynamics, climate, riverine and Atlantic influence. The Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) is a hydrodynamically and bathymetrically complex area under strong human influence, which has been characterized by eutrophication (up to the 1980s) and de-eutrophication (1990s onwards), and pronounced long-term changes in turbidity and water temperature. We used a newly recovered and standardized historic dataset, the Belgian Phytoplankton Database (Nohe et al., 2018), to compare the biomass, composition and seasonality of diatom and dinoflagellate assemblages, two key components of the plankton in the BPNS, between the 1970s and 2000s. Diatoms, especially large-sized taxa, showed an increase from late winter to summer, resulting in a more intense and extended growing season in the 2000s. Dinoflagellates increased year-round but especially in summer. Both diatom and dinoflagellate blooms showed a clear shift towards an earlier bloom start. In addition, while in the 1970s distinct seasonal community types were present, a striking seasonal homogenization in community structure had occurred by the 2000s. Finally, we observed a pronounced increase in the abundance of harmful diatom and dinoflagellate genera. The observed changes are most likely due to an increase in sea surface temperature and water transparency, and changes in nutrient loads and ratios. Our study underscores the importance of recovering previously inaccessible historic data as they can offer unprecedented insights into long-term change in marine ecosystems, which are essential for properly evaluating the impact of human activities on these ecosystems.","Nohe, A.; Goffin, A.; Tyberghein, L.; Lagring, R.; De Cauwer, K.; Vyverman, W.; Sabbe, K.","WOS:000519987300098","Tyberghein, Lennert, L.","Flanders Marine Institute","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136316","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Marine Data Archeology""","Belgium","","Diatoms, ""Dinoflagellates"", ""Long-term changes"", ""Phytoplankton""","","Belgian part of the North Sea","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Lab Protistol & Aquat Ecol, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Phytoplankton; Diatoms; Dinoflagellates; Belgian part of the North Sea; Long-term changes","LONG-TERM CHANGES; EASTERN ENGLISH-CHANNEL; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL WATERS; SOUTHERN BIGHT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; OCEAN","Environmental Sciences","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 11.0, 'SDG_7': 2.0, 'SDG_6': 1.0}"

Data on the animalâ€™s geographical location and its changes through time are used to study for instance movement patterns, habitat use and migration. The acoustic signals are detected by stand-alone receivers, allowing to collect huge amounts of data over long periods of time. However, large volumes of data might contain large errors. The traditional Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method used to calculate underwater positions, is a point-by-point approach: every position is calculated independently of all other positions. This method assumes that the acoustic transmissions follow a linear path. In many environments, this assumption is violated, for instance by reflections of the acoustic signal against hard surfaces, such as rock formations and concrete walls, or by diffractions around obstacles. Hence, acoustic positioning datasets usually require additional filtering. Unfortunately, the performance of the available filtering techniques is often unclear or ambiguous, especially when reflections occur. An alternative to the point-by-point approach, is a track-oriented approach, as used by YAPS (Yet Another Positioning System). This novel algorithm uses the information that is present in previous and subsequent positions, by combining a model of fish behaviour with Time of Arrival (TOA) of the signals on the receivers. In this study, we investigated the performance of two filtering techniques applied to positions provided by the Vemco Positioning System (VPS) in a highly reflective environment. We compared the unfiltered VPS positions with a standard filtering technique, making use of the Horizontal Positioning Error (HPE), and developed a new filter based on receiver cluster classification. Finally, we recalculated the positions with YAPS and compared the performance of this system to the two filtering techniques.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Results</h3><p>The performance of the VPS system was strongly impeded by the multiple reflections occurring in this study area, but lowering the power output of transmitters can slightly attenuate this issue. None of the filtering techniques was able to compensate for reflections and to improve the positioning accuracy significantly. Only the YAPS algorithm could cope with the high level of reflectivity in this study site.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusions</h3><p>Point-by-point algorithms might fail to provide accurate fine-scale tracks in a highly reflective acoustic environment.

In areas that are too large to be fully covered by the limited detection ranges of receivers or acoustic listening stations, researchers generally assume that animals are residing in an area when they are detected frequently at specific receivers. There is, however, no consensus on how this area and frequency should be spatially and temporally defined respectively, thereby introducing some unaccounted uncertainty of this residency-at-receivers. In longitudinal aquatic systems such as rivers or estuaries, strategically placed receivers are often used as gates or curtains through which tagged animals have to pass. Rather than being a proxy for the time spent near receivers, the detections can serve as boundary conditions to delineate the durations that animals spent between receivers (i.e. residency-between-receivers). As such, providing a spatial and temporal context to the detections and enabling the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. To assess the usefulness of this approach, we analyzed telemetry data for migrating eel in a longitudinal estuarine acoustic tracking network of 21 gates. Results revealed a logarithmic relationship between epistemic uncertainty and gate network resolution, which indicates that transferring information from the spatial to the temporal level has a positive effect on the epistemic uncertainty. The poor correlation between the at-receivers and the between-receivers approach indicates that the latter, although less precise, may be more accurate. It should be noted that the suggested approach assumes that the gates of receivers are perfect detectors. If tagged animals are able to pass these gates undetected the uncertainty will actually be higher than assumed. Our approach is therefore less suited for large open areas such as lagoons or seas where gates with high detection probabilities are logistically challenging. This approach allows the quantification and reduction of epistemic uncertainty by providing a spatiotemporal context to the detections. Since establishing and maintaining passive telemetry networks is generally expensive and the results these networks generate are often used in decision making, an assessment of the network quality and data uncertainty is vital.","Bruneel, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Baetens, J.M.; Coeck, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.","WOS:000564618700008","Moens, Tom, T.","Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101133","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","Epistemic uncertainty; Estuary; Fish; Gates; Network design; Passive acoustic; telemetry curtains","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Epistemic uncertainty; Estuary; Fish; Gates; Network design; Passive acoustic telemetry curtains","ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; DETECTION RANGE; RESIDENCE TIME; FISH; DESIGN; POSITIONS; BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; ARRAY","Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL)","x","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_9': 1.0}"

The purpose is to provide an authoritative, open-access inventory of all foraminiferal taxonomic names. The inventory is almost complete for both fossil and Recent foraminiferal taxa, containing 4932 generic and 55,884 species (including infraspecies) names. There are âˆ¼61,000 genus-species combinations of which âˆ¼54,600 are currently â€œacceptedâ€ species and infraspecies (with 9600 extant). Associated data includes 14,700 linked foraminiferal literature sources, âˆ¼6600 images, and species-level links to many other databases and images, such as the Cushman Collection (Smithsonian Institution), American Museum of Natural History, Mikrotax (planktic foraminifera), GenBank, and Zootaxon. The WoRMS database is owned by the global taxonomic community and hosted and serviced by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), Belgium. We recommend that all researchers working with foraminifera both use and contribute to the World Foraminifera Database, as that will improve the accuracy of the database's content and save investigators many hours of searching elsewhere.","Hayward, B.W.; Le Coze, F.; Vandepitte, L.; Vanhoorne, B.","WOS:000582618800004","Hayward, Bruce, B.W.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.2113/gsjfr.50.3.291","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","","","","","","Journal article","","","Geomarine Res, 19 Debron Ave, Auckland, New Zealand.","New Zealand","","BIODIVERSITY","Paleontology","Paleontology","Geomarine Research","","New Zealand","","Research institute","Science","OK","{}"

Among these causes are manâ€made structures blocking their freshwater migration routes. Shipping canals with navigation locks play a dual role in this. These canals can serve as an important migration route, offering a short cut between freshwater and the sea. In contrast, the navigation locks may act as barriers to migration, causing delays and migration failures. To better understand these issues for downstream migrating fish, we studied the behaviour of European eels (<i>Anguilla anguilla</i>) in the Albert Canal at two scales. The midâ€scale contained a 27â€km canal pound confined by two navigation lock complexes, in which we released and tracked 86 silver eels. The small scale was a 200Â Ã—Â 150Â m area just in front of the most downstream complex of the canal pound, where we analysed the behaviour of 33 eels in relation to the flow field resulting from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. This paper discusses the factors influencing fish behaviour, and the relation between these behaviours on both scales. On the midâ€scale, migration efficiency resulted from a combination of intrinsic behaviour and flow in the canal pound. Also on the small scale, intrinsic behaviour influenced the success to pass the navigation lock. Increasing the flow would create more attraction and passage opportunities and hence facilitate migration through shipping canals, but only if this flow guides the fish through safe passage routes.","Vergeynst, J.; Pauwels, I.; Baeyens, R.; Mouton, A.; De Mulder, T.; Nopens, I.","WOS:000550449500001","Vergeynst, Jenna, J.","BIOMATHâ€”Model-Based Analysis and Optimisation of Bioprocesses, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Universiteit Gent","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/eff.12565","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","Computational fluid dynamics","","downstream fish migration, European eel, fish behaviour, navigation locks, shipping canal","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, BIOMATH Model Based Anal & Optimisat Bioproc, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","computational fluid dynamics; downstream fish migration; European eel; fish behaviour; navigation locks; shipping canal","SILVER EELS; FISH; L.","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling - BIOMATH","x","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_2': 1.0, 'SDG_14': 1.0}"

Imaging systems are used more and more frequently in the marine domain to generate huge amounts of imagery data. For example, automatic image classification is used to determine the abundance, size and biomass of plankton communities. In addition, the recent advances of imaging sensors and the growing datasets, highlight the importance of the management and storage capacity of these data. Thus, establishing data standards, optimized data flows and quality control procedures will promote the ability to make these datasets findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR principles).At the moment, there are a number of online open-access databases that collect marine biodiversity data, such as the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), and more specialized in plankton observations such as the COPEPOD for plankton biomass and ECOTAXA for taxonomic annotation of plankton images. However, they currently lack relevant standards to link metadata of the images.International biodiversity data standards, such as Darwin Core (DwC), are already widely used in OBIS and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). OBIS, has recently adopted the OBIS-ENV-DATA, a format that follows the DwC-Archive (DwC-A) standard, consisting of a DwC Event table in combination with an Occurrence an extended Measurement or Fact table. This structure enables the linkage of quantitative and qualitative properties to both sampling events and species occurrences. It also includes additional fields for property standardization, such as the BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) controlled vocabularies, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), which provides crucial quality control support for taxonomic data, and Marine Regions, a database that provides standardized marine georeferenced place names and areas. However, there are no clear guidelines on how to include imagery metadata and derived data in OBIS-ENV-DATA.During this TDWG 2020 symposium, we would like to present and discuss our ongoing work to establish best practices and standardized protocols for imaging data and metadata acquired by a large spectrum of bio-optic sensors.

A new advancement in the domain is Yet Another Positioning Solver (YAPS), which combines the detection data on the receivers with a model of animal movement. This transparent, flexible and on-line available positioning algorithm overcomes problems related to traditional point-by-point positioning and filtering techniques.

We found that a receiver resolution better than 1Â ms is required for accurate fine-scale positioning. The positioning accuracy of YAPS increases with decreasing burst intervals, especially when the number of observations is low, when reflectivity is high or when information out-of-array is used. However, when the burst interval is stable, large burst intervals (in the order of 1 to 2 min) can be chosen without strongly hampering the accuracy (although this results in information loss).

The imagery represents a rich source of data on mammals larger than ~200 grams, providing information at the level of species and communities. Camera-trap surveys generate observations of specific mammals at a certain location and time, including photo evidence that can be evaluated by experts to map species distribution patterns. The imagery also provides information on the species composition of local communities, identifying which species co-occur and in what proportion. Moreover, the images contain information on activity patterns and other interesting aspects of animal behaviour. Because surveys can be standardized relatively easily, camera traps are well suited for documenting shifts in the behaviour, distribution and community composition, for example in response to climate and land-use change. Imagery from camera traps can thus serve as a baseline for subsequent surveys.    In less than two decades, camera traps have become the standard tool for surveying mammals. They are simple to use and non-invasive, requiring no special permits. As a consequence they are widely used by professionals and hobbyists alike. Together, tens of thousands of users have the potential to form a huge sensor network. Unfortunately however, imagery and data collected are currently rarely integrated. Rather, they are lost at a massive scale. Users tend to retain only a subset of the photos and discard the rest. Or the material ends up on an external hard disk that will at some point fail or be erased as these scientific data tend to be used within the scope of specific projects. Very few of the wealth of material becomes available for scientific research and monitoring. Moreover, joint projects are rare and there is little coordination between camera-trap users.    A solution to this problem is provided by Agouti, a platform for the organization, processing and storage of camera-trap imagery (www.agouti.eu). The aim of Agouti is, on the one hand, to standardize and facilitate collaborative camera-trap surveys, and on the other hand to compile and secure imagery and data for scientific research and monitoring, by encouraging users to share their material. Agouti provides an interface that allows users to collaborate on projects, organize and manage their surveys, upload and store imagery, and annotate images with species identifications and characteristics. Images can also be annotated through basic image recognition and crowd sourcing via a connection with the citizen science platform Zooniverse, which creates the potential to reach new audiences. Exporting data and imagery in the Camera Trap Metadata Standard (Forrester et al. 2016) will be supported in the near future. This will allow data to be archived outside of Agouti in research repositories such as Zenodo and by further mapping to Darwin Core to be made discoverable on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).    Agouti provides both professionals and the public with a practical solution for retaining camera-trap surveys and simultaneously engages people in contributing data to science in a standardized and organized manner, to the benefit of science and conservation.","Casaer, J.; Milotic, T.; Liefting, Y.; Desmet, P.; Jansen, P.","","Desmet, Peter, P.","Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)","https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.3.46690","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","camera traps, mammals, biodiversity monitoring, distribution, citizen science, open data, standardization","Journal article","","","","","","","","","INBO Research Institute for Nature and Forest","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_15': 3.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0, 'SDG_7': 1.0}"

An important aspect of studying migratory species is therefore to distinguish between movement and resident behavior. Telemetry is a rapidly evolving technique to study animal movement, but the number of data processing techniques to account for resident behavior remains limited. In this study we describe how models that were initially developed to predict human customer behavior, i.e. two-part and three-part models, provide new insights in the movement of migrating eel by accounting for resident behavior apparent from telemetry data sets. In econometrics, two-part models take into account that the decision of a customer to purchase an item and the decision of the customer on the purchase quantity of the concerning product, might be affected by different factors. Similarly, the factors that affect the decision of a fish to migrate or to stay resident might be different from the factors that affect the swimming speed of the fish. Telemetry data of eel movement in the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network (PBARN) of the Scheldt Estuary was used. This network with high detection probabilities allowed residencies to be recognized, defined, and introduced as zero values in a movement-residency data set. Two-part models, which consider movement decision, i.e. residency or movement, and movement intensity, i.e. swimming speed, as two different processes or parts of one larger model, outperformed one-part models that do not make that distinction. This underlines the complex migration behavior eels exhibit. These two-part models in turn were outperformed by three-part models that also accounted for cryptic (i.e. unobserved) residencies. While the one-part model identified the tides and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for movement, the three-part models identified the tides as most important for the movement decision and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for the movement intensity. Considering movement decisions, cryptic residencies and movement intensity in modeling efforts increased model performance by 9.8%, underlining the importance of acknowledging the potentially complex behavior animals exhibit.","Bruneel, S.; Verhelst, P.; Reubens, J.; Luca, S.; Coeck, J.; Moens, T.; Goethals, P.","WOS:000595067700009","Moens, Tom, T.","Marine Biology Research Group, Ghent University","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109340","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","Acoustic telemetry; Fish movement; Residency; Gate; Two-part and three-part model; Eel migration","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","Acoustic telemetry; Fish movement; Residency; Gate; Two-part and three-part model; Eel migration","EELS ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; MIGRATION BEHAVIOR; ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY; SAMPLE SELECTION; DETECTION RANGE; 2-PART","Ecology","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL)","x","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_2': 2.0, 'SDG_14': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 1.0}"

Monitoring marine biodiversity in such habitats is, however, challenging as it typically involves expensive, non-standardized, and often destructive sampling methods that limit its scalability. Differences in monitoring approaches furthermore hinders inter-comparison among monitoring programs. Here, we announce a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) consisting of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) with the aim to assess the status and changes in benthic fauna with genomic-based methods, notably DNA metabarcoding, in combination with image-based identifications. This article presents the results of a 30-month pilot phase in which we established an operational and geographically expansive ARMS-MBON. The network currently consists of 20 observatories distributed across European coastal waters and the polar regions, in which 134 ARMS have been deployed to date. Sampling takes place annually, either as short-term deployments during the summer or as long-term deployments starting in spring. The pilot phase was used to establish a common set of standards for field sampling, genetic analysis, data management, and legal compliance, which are presented here. We also tested the potential of ARMS for combining genetic and image-based identification methods in comparative studies of benthic diversity, as well as for detecting non-indigenous species. Results show that ARMS are suitable for monitoring hard-bottom environments as they provide genetic data that can be continuously enriched, re-analyzed, and integrated with conventional data to document benthic community composition and detect non-indigenous species. Finally, we provide guidelines to expand the network and present a sustainability plan as part of the European Marine Biological Resource Centre (www.embrc.eu).","Obst, Matthias; Exter, Katrina; Allcock, A.

Little is known about the effects of these sounds on free-ranging fish behavior. Effects reported range from subtle individual change in activity and swimming depth for captive fish to potential avoidance and changes in swimming velocity and diurnal activity patterns for free-swimming animals. However, the extent and duration of behavioral responses to seismic surveys remain largely unexplored for most fish species. In this study, we investigated the effect of a full-scale seismic survey on the movement behavior of free-swimming Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>). We found that cod did not leave the detection area more than expected during the experimental survey but that they left more quickly from 2 days to 2 weeks after the survey. Furthermore, during the exposure, cod decreased their activity, with time spent being â€œlocally activeâ€ (moving small distances, showing high body acceleration) becoming shorter, and time spent being â€œinactiveâ€ (moving small distances, having low body acceleration) becoming longer. Additionally, diurnal activity cycles were disrupted with lower locally active peaks at dusk and dawn, periods when cod are known to actively feed. The combined effects of delayed deterrence and activity disruption indicate the potential for seismic surveys to affect energy budgets and to ultimately lead to population-level consequences.","van der Knaap, I.; Reubens, J.; Thomas, L.; Ainslie, M.A.; Winter, H.V.; Hubert, J.; Martin, B.; Slabbekoorn, H.","WOS:000640072800010","Winter, Hendrik, H.V.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.050","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","Acoustic telemetry","","Atlantic cod, airgun array, good environmental status, hidden Markov models, noise pollution, movement behavior","Journal article","","","Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Lab, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Belgium","","HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; NORTH-SEA; GADUS-MORHUA; FISH; TELEMETRY; BEHAVIOR; TECHNOLOGY; TRACKING; STORAGE; STATES","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology","Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL)","x","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 3.0, 'SDG_2': 1.0}"

Here, we evaluated the contribution of each receiver within two APT designs to the number of tag signals detected and the position accuracy of free-ranging Atlantic cod, through data exclusion of single receivers from the analysis.

Excluding the data from a single receiver caused a maximum of 34% positions lost per fish and a maximum increase in core area of 97.8%. Single-receiver data exclusion also caused a potentially large bias in the reconstruction of swimming tracks. By contrast, exclusion of a receiver that was deployed within 50&nbsp;m from a turbine actually improved fish position accuracy, probably because the turbine can cause signal interference as a reflective barrier.</p><h3 class=""c-article__sub-heading"" data-test=""abstract-sub-heading"">Conclusions</h3><p>We recommend that an exploratory small-scale study like the one presented here be conducted before embarking on a larger-scale APT study. By excluding the data of single receivers from the positioning analysis, we were able to explore the suitability of a receiver set-up for the movement patterns of our target species. Furthermore, when a receiver is lost from an APT during deployment, the data should be treated with care as our results show that changes in triangulation outcome can lead to considerable differences in swimming tracks and home range estimates.","Van der Knaap, I.; Slabbekoorn, H.; Winter, H.V.; Moens, T.; Reubens, J.","","Winter, Hendrik, H.V.","","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40317-021-00238-y","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","Acoustic telemetry, Position triangulation, Behaviour, Atlantic cod, Offshore structures, Wind power","Journal article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_7': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 1.0}"

Consequently, consistent time-series are fundamental to monitor the status of plankton communities and predict future changes that can greatly affect the whole food-chain. Here, a recent time series (2014â€“2020) of image-based copepod abundance data from the Belgian Part of the North Sea has been explored and compared with previously collected (2009â€“2010) microscopy-based datasets for the same study area. The time series revealed distinct discrepancies in copepod phenology, abundances and total biomass between nearshore and offshore regions. The nearshore area was characterised by an altered copepod dynamics through time, with the occurrence of a single annual spring peak in both abundance and total biomass, and no autumn peak usually described and present in that area. Conversely, the autumn peak was clearly observed at the offshore stations, together with a distinct additional early spring peak in comparison to the nearshore and midshore regions which has not been documented before. Remarkable anomalies were detected within the time-serie of copepod for both abundance and biomass, notably in autumn of 2018 and in a lesser extend in 2014 and 2019, with values dropping to near-zero for the nearshore stations. The various heat waves during the summer periods of these years are considered potential causes for these copepod decreases, since they corresponded to the physiological thermal limit of many copepods species known to be present in the area. These heat waves events could have also favoured predators of copepods such as jellyfishes as well as enhancing the occurrence of d harmful algal blooms. Both anomalies in 2018 and 2019 actually coincided with important phytoplankton autumn blooms. The results from this copepod time-series analysis illustrates the changes affecting this essential marine trophic level and highlights the value and relevance of copepod long-term data series in the context of climate change and ecosystem management.","Mortelmans, J.; Aubert, A.; Reubens, J.; Otero, V.; Deneudt, K.; Mees, J.","WOS:000656425200002","Aubert, AnaÃ¯s, A.","Flanders Marine Institute","https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103558","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","Belgium","","Time series, ""Zooplankton""","","Copepods; ZooScan; Belgian part of the North Sea; Climate change; Image recognition","Journal article","","","Flanders Marine Inst, Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.","Belgium","Zooplankton; Copepods; Time-series; ZooScan; Belgian part of the North Sea; Climate change; Image recognition","CONTINUOUS PLANKTON RECORDER; DOMINANT CALANOID COPEPODS; ZOOPLANKTON DYNAMICS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ENGLISH-CHANNEL; CLIMATE; ZOOSCAN; SIZE; INFERENCE","Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute","","Belgium","x","Research institute","Science","OK","{'SDG_14': 3.0, 'SDG_2': 2.0, 'SDG_15': 1.0}"

We review current management measures and their effectiveness, and propose a way forward. Current management of diadromous fish populations largely focuses on mitigation of migration barriers, but management will likely fail if other fundamental aspects of diadromous speciesâ€™ life cycles are overlooked or disregarded.

Pulse position modulation (PPM) is an acoustic telemetry method that allows multiple unique identification codes to be transmitted at a single acoustic frequency, typically in the 69 kHz range. However, because the potential number of unique identification codes (i.e. tags) is ultimately limited by the number of pulses in the PPM signal, this poses a practical limitation. In addition, different manufacturers have developed different approaches to encoding the transmitted data, hampering compatibility across brands. A lack of broad compatibility across telemetry systems restricts users to a single manufacturer and operating system, reduces market competition and limits innovation. As the aquatic animal tracking research community organizes towards networks of devices and data, incompatibility becomes more problematic and jeopardizes the unique scientific benefits offered by the networking approach.

Among other groups, pelagic fish are likely to be affected by sound from human activities, but so far have received relatively little attention. Offshore wind farms have become numerous and will become even more abundant in the next decades. Wind farms can be interesting to pelagic fish due to food abundance or fisheries restrictions. At the same time, construction of wind farms involves high levels of anthropogenic noise, likely disturbing and/or deterring pelagic fish. Here, we investigated whether bottom-moored echosounders are a suitable tool for studying the effects of impulsive â€“ intermittent, high-intensity â€“ anthropogenic noise on pelagic fish around wind farms and we explored the possible nature of their responses. Three different wind farms along the Dutch and Belgian coast were examined, one with exposure to the passing by of an experimental seismic survey with a full-scale airgun array, one with pile driving activity in an adjacent wind farm construction site and one control site without exposure. Two bottom-moored echosounders were placed in each wind farm and recorded fish presence and behaviour before, during and after the exposures. The echosounders were successful in detecting variation in the number of fish schools and their behaviour. During the seismic survey exposure there were significantly fewer, but more cohesive, schools than before, whereas during pile driving fish swam shallower with more cohesive schools. However, the types and magnitudes of response patterns were also observed at the control site with no impulsive sound exposure. We therefore stress the need for thorough replication beyond single case studies, before we can conclude that impulsive sounds, from either seismic surveys or pile driving, are a disturbing factor for pelagic fish in otherwise attractive habitat around wind farms.","Kok, A.C.M.; Bruil, L.; Berges, B.; Sakinan, S.; Debusschere, E.; Reubens, J.; de Haan, D.; Norro, A.; Slabbekoorn, H.","","Sakinan, Serdar, S.","","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118063","","Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""","","","","","Anthropogenic noise; Fish schools; Good environmental status; Noise impact assessment","Journal article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","OK","{'SDG_11': 4.0, 'SDG_14': 1.0}"

Fish can hear particle motion, and a swim bladder potentially adds the additional capacity to sense sound pressure. Combining these capacities allows them to sense direction, distance, spectral content, and detailed temporal patterns. Both sound pressure and particle motion were recorded in a shallow part of the North Sea before and during exposure to a full-scale airgun array from an experimental seismic survey. Distinct amplitude fluctuations and directional patterns in the ambient noise were found to be fluctuating in phase with the tidal cycles and coming from distinct directions. It was speculated that the patterns may be determined by distant sources associated with large rivers and nearby beaches. Sounds of the experimental seismic survey were above the ambient conditions for particle acceleration up to 10 km from the source, at least as detectable for the measurement device, and up to 31â€‰km for the sound pressure.

Collectively, camera trapping projects are generating a massive and continuous flow of data, consisting of images and videos (with and without animal observations) and associated identifications (Scotson et al. 2017, Kays et al. 2020). In recent years, significant progress has been made by the global camera trapping community to resolve the challenges this brings, from the development of specialized data management tools and analytical packages, to the application of cloud computing and artificial intelligence to automate species recognition (Tabak et al. 2018). However, to effectively exchange camera trap data between infrastructures and to (automatically) harmonize data into large-scale wildlife datasets, there is a need for a common data exchange formatâ€”one that captures the essential information about a camera trap study, allows expression of different study and identification approaches, and aligns well with existing biodiversity standards such as Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012). Here we present Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP), a data exchange format for camera trap data. It is managed by the Machine Observations Interest Group of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and developed publicly, soliciting community feedback for every change. Camtrap DP is built on Frictionless Standards, a set of generic specifications to describe and package (tabular) data and metadata. Camtrap DP extends these with specific requirements and constraints for camera trap data. By building on an existing framework, users can employ existing open source software to read and validate Camtrap DP formatted data. Validation especially is useful to automatically check if provided data meets the requirements set forth by Camtrap DP, before analysis or integration. Supported by the major camera trap data management systems e.g. Agouti, TRAPPER, eMammal, and Wildlife Insights, Camtrap DP is reaching its first stable version. The first Camtrap DP dataset was published on Zenodo (Cartuyvels et al. 2021b).

However, WoRMS mainly focuses on taxonomy and does not specifically address species introductions. Here, we introduce the World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS), a database directly linked to WoRMS that includes all introduced marine species, distinguishing native and introduced geographic ranges. Both the WoRMS and  WRiMS contents are continually updated by specialists who add citations of original species descriptions, key taxonomic literature, images and notes on native and introduced geographic distributions. WRiMS editors take responsibility for assessing the validity of species records by critically evaluating if a species has been introduced to a region, erroneously identified and/or potentially naturally present in a region but previously unnoticed. WRiMS currently contains 2,714 introduced species. The amount and quality of the information entered depend on  the availability of experts to update its contents. Because WRiMS is global and it combines species taxonomic and geographic information with links to other resources and expertise, it is currently the most comprehensive standardised database of marine introduced species.
