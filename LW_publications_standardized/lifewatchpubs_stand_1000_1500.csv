Forty-four superficial sediment samples were collected along distance-to-sea and elevation gradients in the winter and summer of 2010. Fifty-three foraminifera species were identified along the intertidal margins of the estuary. Foraminiferal distribution reflected seasonal variation of environmental factors, whose relative importance varied according to species tolerances. Elevation in relation to mean sea level appeared to be the most important parameter controlling foraminiferal distribution, probably because it combines the effects of a series of other variables (i.e. organic matter, sediment texture, pH and temperature). In the highest marsh areas, where environmental conditions approach survival thresholds, only some agglutinated species are able to survive. In the lower intertidal zone, where subaerial exposure is diminished and environmental conditions are generally less variable, more diverse faunas, mainly composed of calcareous species, prevail. During winter, when fluvial discharge peaks, agglutinated species represent more than 80% of the total individuals. In summer, when marine conditions prevail, calcareous species become more competitive, increase their densities and expand into higher marsh zones and estuarine upper reaches.In the estuary, three different foraminiferal assemblages are distinguished: i) <i>Miliammina fusca</i> assemblage, which dominates in unvegetated areas of the lower marsh and tidal flats of the mid-upper estuary; ii) <i>Jadammina macrescens</i> assemblage, which dominates in the highest marsh areas in the lower estuary; and iii) <i>Ammonia aberdoveyensis</i> assemblage, which dominates the areas of low marsh and tidal flats of the lower estuary.","Camacho, S.; Moura, D.; Connor, S.; Scott, D.; Boski, T.",WOS:000350185100001,"Camacho, Sarita, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2014.10.004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Foraminifera,,,"Guadiana Estuary, Foraminifera, Seasonal distribution, Elevation, Bio-indicators",Journal article,,,"Univ Algarve, CIMA, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",Portugal,Guadiana Estuary; Foraminifera; Seasonal distribution; Elevation; Bio-indicators,SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT-MARSH FORAMINIFERA; GREAT-MARSHES; SW-EUROPE; ASSEMBLAGES; DISTRIBUTIONS; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; SALINITY; SPAIN,Paleontology,Paleontology,University of Algarve - Faculty of Sciences and Technology - CIMA (Ctr Environm & Marine Res),x,,,,

A Biological Pollution Index was applied and evaluated. Overall 130 macrozoobenthic species were identified, 17 of which were aquatic alien species. The Szczecin Lagoon had the highest number of invasive species (13). Most species were of Pontocaspian origin; inland waterways are likely to play a significant role in their migration. According to the Biological Pollution Index Level (BPL) this lagoon was ‘moderately influenced’ by invasive species. Warnow Estuary had 11 invasive species; their origin noted generally from North-America, suggesting shipping traffic as the major distribution vector; invasive species had the same BPL as in the Szczecin Lagoon. In the Darß Zingst Bodden Chain only 6 invasive species were observed, having the highest relative abundance (9-71%). Furthermore, this area had the highest BPL of all three areas, i.e. a strong negative impact. The BPL required a lot of data (including historical) and some ratings were subjective and comparisons with other areas assessed were difficult and often impossible. Due to these limitations, it is suggested that the BPL should only be used with restrictions as a universal assessment tool for invasive species in the estuarine and lagoon waters of the Baltic Sea.

When the fauna was last reviewed in 1994 there were 94 species known from the Great Barrier Reef and it was predicted that there might be 2,270 in total. There are now 326 species reported for the region, suggesting that we are in a much improved position to make an accurate prediction of true trematode richness. Here we review the current state of knowledge of the fauna and the ways in which our understanding of this fascinating group is changing. Our best estimate of the true richness is now a range, 1,100–1,800 species. However there remains considerable scope for even these figures to be incorrect given that fewer than one-third of the fish species of the region have been examined for trematodes.

The majority of non-indigenous taxa were recorded in the mediolittoral belt and coastal lagoons. The low number of non-indigenous species so far recorded in the Slovenian part of the Adriatic sea could be explained by various factors. Among them, the most reasonable are the lack of scientific attention, the small proportion of Slovenian Sea and low winter temperatures, which represents a physiological barrier for the survival of newcomers.

To test these two sets of views in greater detail, we have compiled the available data for marine benthic ciliates and assessed the general patterns of their diversity and distribution compared with Metazoa. A comprehensive database (1342 species, over 350 sources) was used to analyse the diversity, distribution, species occurrences and range size distribution of free-living ciliates that inhabit marine sediments in 17 geographical regions. Twenty-five per cent of the species have been found in a single region only, whereas 18% are widespread (they occur in more than half the regions covering both hemispheres). Only 5–7% of regional faunas are endemic, which is much lower than for macroorganisms. Regional diversity depends neither on total area nor on coastline length and does not show any obvious latitudinal trends, but correlates highly with the investigation effort expended in a region and (negatively) with the average salinity. A comparison of species composition reveals distinctions between the Arctic Area (the White, Barents and Kara seas), Laurasian Area (north Atlantic, north Pacific and European seas), Gondwanian Area (Southern Ocean) and the Antarctic. No clear geographical correlations are found for faunistic composition at the genus or family levels. There is the tendency to narrow the latitudinal ranges for species found at high latitudes (reversal of Rapoport's rule). Undersampling and data insufficiency are the key factors affecting the observed diversity and distribution of microorganisms. Nevertheless, marine benthic ciliates demonstrate certain patterns that generally agree with the ‘moderate endemicity’ model (Foissner, 2004, 2008), but consistently contradict the regularities commonly observed for multicellular taxa. Thus, ciliates do have a biogeography, but their macroecological patterns may be different in some respects from that of macroorganisms.","Azovsky, A.; Mazei, Y.",WOS:000313267000002,"Azovsky, Andrey, A.","Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, Moscow 119899, Russia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00776.x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Ciliates; distribution; diversity; latitudinal gradients; marine; Rapoport's rule,Journal article,,,"Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Hydrobiol, Moscow 119899, Russia.",Russia,Ciliates; distribution; diversity; latitudinal gradients; marine; Rapoport's rule,BIOGEOGRAPHY; BIODIVERSITY; COSMOPOLITANISM; ECOSYSTEMS; DISPERSAL; STRENGTH; ENDEMISM; PROTOZOA; OCEAN; WORLD,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Lomonosov Moscow State University,,Russia,,University,Science

We also compared identifications with genetic clustering (Barcode Index Numbers, BINs) computed by the Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD). About 68% of our morphological identifications were congruent with BINs created by BOLD. Forty-nine sequences were clustered in 16 discordant BINs, and these were divided in two classes: sequences from different species clustered in a single BIN and conspecific sequences divided in more BINs. Whereas former incongruences were probably caused by BOLD entries in need of a taxonomic update, the latter incongruences regarded taxa requiring further investigations.

Spread rates of native species may underestimate how fast species can move, we therefore assessed how fast Lessepsian species (marine non-native species that invaded the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal) can spread to give a ‘best-case’ assessment of the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity. We show that about 20% of Lessepsian species could not spread fast enough to keep pace with climate change in about 20% of the global seas and this suggests that climate change may lead to biodiversity loss. The velocity of climate change on the seabed is much lower than at the sea surface, and as a result of this the proportion of species that keep pace with climate change at the seabed was much larger than at the sea surface. This suggests that locations at depth could act as refuges for slow dispersing species. Our analysis compared different estimates of the spreading abilities of marine species and showed that the estimate of spread rates strongly affects the predicted effect of climate change on biodiversity. Providing more accurate estimates of the spreading ability of marine species should therefore have priority if we want to predict the effect of climate change on marine biodiversity. This study is a first approximation of the potential scale and distribution of global marine biodiversity loss and can provide benchmark estimates of the spread rates that species could achieve in colonizing suitable habitat.

It is composed of aromatic moieties and has great potential for use in the production of chemical alternatives to petroleum products. Because of increasing interest in biocatalysis, the potential for industrial application of microbial metabolism of lignin-derived compounds has gained considerable recent attention. Functional screenings of culturable bacteria isolated from sediments and sunken wood collected from the deep sea revealed the existence of a number of previously unidentified bacteria capable of metabolizing lignin-related aromatic compounds. Of the 510 isolates obtained in the present study, 208 completely or partially metabolized these compounds. The 208 isolates were classified into diverse phyla, including Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Among the 208 isolates, 61 unique 16S rRNA gene sequences were detected including previously unidentified marine lineage isolates. The metabolites of the isolates were analysed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Most of the representative 61 isolates non-oxidatively decarboxylated the substrates to produce the corresponding aromatic vinyl monomers, which are used as feed stocks for bio-based plastics production. Oxidative metabolism of the lignin-related compounds for assimilation was frequently observed. Our study showed that the deep-sea environment contains an abundance of microorganisms capable of both non-oxidative and oxidative bioconversion of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. The ability for bio- conversion of aromatic compounds found in this study will facilitate the development of future biotechnological applications.

Classical morphological systematics was often based on non-cladistic approaches, while modern phylogenetic studies suffer from severe undersampling of taxa and characters (both molecular and morphological). Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of the familial relationships within the Balanomorpha. We estimate divergence times and examine morphological diversity based on five genes, 156 specimens, 10 fossil calibrations, and six key morphological characters. Two balanomorphan superfamilies, eight families and twelve genera were identified as polyphyletic. Chthamaloids, chionelasmatoid and pachylasmatoids split first from the pedunculated ancestors followed by a clade of tetraclitoids and coronuloids, and most of the balanoids. The Balanomorpha split from the Verrucidae (outgroup) in the Lower Cretaceous (139.6 Mya) with all the main lineages, except Pachylasmatoidea, having emerged by the Paleocene (60.9 Mya).

The influence of depth and sediment type on the spatial distribution of shallow soft-bottom amphipods was tested by means of univariate and multivariate methods. Samples were collected down to 40 m depth within areas ranging from very fine sand to gravel. The ratio between density and diversity was found to increase with depth and from coarser to finer sediments. Both physical variables tested were found to play a major role in structuring amphipod assemblages. However, some dominance of depth was evident as samples were mainly separated according to this variable. Moreover, while only 15 taxa were common to all depth levels, 35 were collected from all sediment types. Both depth and sediment type may override the potential effects of geographical location, as samples from different areas along the southern Portuguese coast were biologically related. A peculiar habitat was sampled in this study: a maerl bed, which was confirmed to be a hotspot of density. Nevertheless, this habitat did not harbor a distinct amphipod assemblage but some taxa such as <i>Caprella</i> spp., <i>Lembos websteri, lysianassids and Gammarella fucicola</i> were preferentially collected there. The biogeographical analysis pointed out the occurrence of 8% of Mediterranean endemic species, confirming the influence of the Mediterranean Sea beyond the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Atlantic-Mediterranean feature of the amphipod fauna of this geographically relevant area.

In response, we propose standard terminology that aligns with international practice.

With increasing anthropogenic pressure, it is now a matter of urgency to improve our understanding of deep-sea biodiversity. Traditional morpho-taxonomic studies suggest that the ocean floor hosts extraordinarily diverse benthic communities. However, due to both its remoteness and a lack of expert taxonomists, assessing deep-sea diversity is a very challenging task. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a powerful tool to complement morpho-taxonomic studies. Here we use eDNA to assess benthic metazoan diversity in 39 deep-sea sediment samples from bathyal and abyssal depths worldwide. The eDNA dataset was dominated by meiobenthic taxa and we identified all animal phyla commonly found in the deep-sea benthos; yet, the diversity within these phyla remains largely unknown. The large numbers of taxonomically unassigned molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were not equally distributed among phyla, with nematodes and platyhelminthes being the most poorly characterized from a taxonomic perspective. While the data obtained here reveal pronounced heterogeneity and vast amounts of unknown biodiversity in the deep sea, they also expose the difficulties in exploiting metabarcoding datasets resulting from the lack of taxonomic knowledge and appropriate reference databases. Overall, our study demonstrates the promising potential of eDNA metabarcoding to accelerate the assessment of deep-sea biodiversity for pure and applied deep-sea environmental research but also emphasizes the necessity to integrate such new approaches with traditional morphology-based examination of deep-sea organisms.","Sinniger, F.; Pawlowski, J.; Harii, S.; Gooday, A.J.; Yamamoto, H.; Chevaldonné, P.; Cedhagen, T.; Carvalho, G.; Creer, S.",WOS:000457358000090,"Carvalho, Gary, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2016.00092,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res & Dev Ctr Submarine Resources, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.",Japan,environmental DNA; biodiversity; metabarcoding; meiobenthos; 18S rDNA,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; DIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; PATTERNS; COSMOPOLITANISM; CRUSTACEA; ECOSYSTEM; IMPACT,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

However, the lack of a clear taxonomic consensus led to a vast confusion concerning the relation of Elphidiidae with other rotaliids, in particular Nonionidae (<i>Haynesina</i>) and Rotaliidae (<i>Ammonia</i>). Moreover, high morphological plasticity of the test prevented the establishment of a clear definition for many species and genera of this family. Here, 66 new sequences of the SSU rRNA gene were obtained and used to build an extensive dataset including 94 complete or partial sequences of the SSU rDNA of 17 different morphospecies of Elphidiidae, <i>Haynesina</i> and <i>Ammonia</i>. Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset allowed identifying six strongly supported clades. Comparison of these molecular clades with the morphological characters of the analyzed individuals showed major discrepancies with the current taxonomic system. The relations between the six clades depended on the selection of the outgroup to the Elphidiidae. For biological and morphological reasons, we privileged here the choice of Ammonia, prompting the inclusion of <i>Haynesina</i> to the family Elphidiidae. However, this does not necessarily imply a monophyletic origin of all these taxa.

Although spanning a salinity range of <5–35, the seagrass beds of this estuary contained a unitary fauna with local variation in frequency and abundance of the various species. Faunal biodiversity was highest along the main estuarine channel in the marine-influenced region and declined both upstream and into the sheltered peripheral zones, overall faunal abundance being inversely correlated with species diversity (though not with species richness).

MALDI-TOF MS has been shown to be an efficient dereplication tool as it can be used to discriminate between bacterial isolates at the species level. A bacterial culture collection of more than 10,000 heterotrophic marine bacterial isolates from sea-water surface layers of the Norwegian Trondheimsfjord and neighbouring coastal areas has been established. A sub-collection of pigmented isolates was earlier screened for novel carotenoids with UVA-Blue light absorbing properties. This was a comprehensive analytical task and it was observed that a significant number of extracts with identical pigment profile were recovered. Hence, this study was undertaken to explore the use of MALDI-TOF MS as a dereplication tool to quickly characterize the bacterial collection. Furthermore, LC-DAD-MS analysis of pigment profiles was performed to check if pigment profile diversity was maintained among isolates kept after the potential MALDI-TOF MS selection step. Four hundred isolates comprising both pigmented and non-pigmented isolates were used for this study. The resulting MALDI-TOF MS dendrogram clearly identified a diversity of different taxa and these were supported by the pigment profile clustering, thus linking the pigment production as species-specific properties. Although one exception was found, it can be concluded that MALDI-TOF MS dereplication is a promising pre-screening tool for more efficient screening of microbial culture collection containing pigments with potential novel properties.","Stafsnes, M.H.; Dybwad, M.; Brunsvik, A.; Bruheim, P.",WOS:000314763100017,"Stafsnes, Marit, M.H.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biotechnol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10482-012-9844-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bacteria,,,"Marine bioprospecting, bacteria, Maldi-ToF MS dereplication, pigmentation, LC-MS",Journal article,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Sem Saelands Vei 6-8, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",Norway,Marine bioprospecting; bacteria; Maldi-ToF MS dereplication; pigmentation; LC-MS,DESORPTION IONIZATION-TIME; FLIGHT MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; YEAST; CAROTENOIDS; CLUSTER; TOOLS,Microbiology,Microbiology,Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU),,Norway,,University,Science

They represent a diverse group of highly derived taxa in two superfamilies and 10 families. Little work has been done on the phylogeny of these parasites because of the difficulty in defining homologous characters for adults above the genus level. The females exhibit morphological reduction of characters and the males have few distinguishing characters. Moreover, epicarideans have only rarely been included in past studies of isopod phylogeny. Our objective was to derive a phylogeny of epicaridean taxa based on 18S rDNA, then use that phylogeny to examine the relationships of the bopyrid subfamilies, bopyroid families and epicarideans to cymothoid isopods. We tested the monophyly of the Epicaridea, evaluated hypotheses on relationships among epicaridean families and subfamilies, examined the evolution of the abdominal mode of infestation on caridean, gebiidean, axiidean and anomuran hosts and examined coevolution between epicarideans and their crustacean hosts. The molecular phylogeny indicated that Epicaridea were monophyletic with respect to Cymothooidea. Bopyroidea formed a monophyletic group without Dajidae and Entophilinae (now as Entophilidae). Both latter taxa grouped with Cryptoniscoidea, and this group was the sister taxon to the redefined Bopyroidea in all trees. The bopyrid subfamily Ioninae is the sister taxon to the other bopyrid subfamilies (except Entophilidae). Ioninae was elevated to family status but found not to be monophyletic; a new subfamily, Keponinae, was erected for all genera formerly placed in Ioninae except the type genus. The abdominal mode of parasitism appears to have evolved independently among the subfamilies. Coevolution between host and parasite phylogenies showed extensive incongruence, indicating frequent host-switching as a general pattern in Epicaridea.","Boyko, C.B.; Moss, J.; Williams, J.D.; Shields, J.D.",WOS:000329564800007,"Boyko, Christopher, C.B.","Dowling Coll, Dept Biol, Oakdale, NY 11769 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/14772000.2013.865679,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Bopyridae, ""Decapoda"", ""Epicaridea"", ""Isopoda""",,,"Bopyridae, coevolution, Decapoda, Epicaridea, Isopoda, parasite",Journal article,,,"Dowling Coll, Dept Biol, 150 Idle Hour Blvd, Oakdale, NY 11769 USA.",USA,Bopyridae; coevolution; Decapoda; Epicaridea; Isopoda; parasite,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; PERACARIDA; BOPYRIDAE; EVOLUTION; PARASITES; RECONSTRUCTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; REAPPRAISAL; COEVOLUTION; BRACHYURA,Biodiversity Conservation; Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Dowling College,,USA,,University,Science

New patterns continue to emerge showing that the deep-sea can be dynamic on short time scales, rather than static over long periods. In just over 2 years the community shifted from a sessile, suspension-feeding, sponge-dominated community to a mobile, detritus-feeding, sea cucumber-dominated assemblage. In 2006 megafaunal diversity (Simpson’s Diversity Index, SDI) was high, yet the community was depauperate in terms of density compared to later periods. Over an 18-month period beginning in spring 2011, the densities of mobile organisms increased by nearly an order of magnitude while diversity decreased below 2006 levels. In late 2012 four sea cucumbers (two Peniagone spp., Elpidia sp. A, and <i>Scotoplanes globose</i>) were at the highest densities recorded since investigations began at Station M in 1989. For a group of 10 echinoderms investigated over the entire study period, we saw evidence of a long-term cycle spanning 2 decades. These changes can be tied to a variable food supply originating in shallow water. Large variations over decadal-scales indicate that remote abyssal communities are dynamic and likely subject to impacts from anthropogenic changes like ocean warming, acidification, and pollution manifested in the upper ocean. The degree of dynamism indicates that one-time or short-term investigations are not sufficient for assessing biological community structure in conservation or exploitation studies in the deep sea.","Kuhnz, L.A.; Ruhl, H.A.; Huffard, C.L.; Smith, K.L.",WOS:000336876100001,"Kuhnz, Linda, L.A.","Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2014.04.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",USA,,TIME-SERIES STATION; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; DEEP-SEA; EPIBENTHIC MEGAFAUNA; CARBON FLUX; NE ATLANTIC; CLIMATE; HOLOTHURIANS; ABUNDANCE; PROTOZOANS,Oceanography,Oceanography,Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI),,USA,,Research institute,Science

The occurrence of <i>Persististrombus latus</i> (= <i>Strombus bubonius</i>) and other warm-water indicators (“<i>Senegalaise</i>” – “<i>Senegalian</i>” – guests of Gignoux, 1913), together with the presence of the dinocyst <i>Polysphaeridium zoharyi</i> and ten U-series dates on <i>Cladocora caespitosa</i> samples, permit an unequivocal MIS 5e age assignment to the upper part of the study succession.

Taxonomic classification of over seven million sequences identified organisms spanning around 400 metazoan families and complements previous surveys based on morphological identification. Metabarcoding revealed over 30 orders that were previously not reported, while certain taxonomic groups were underrepresented because of depauperate reference databases. Despite the limitations of assigning metabarcoding data to the species level, zooplankton communities were distinct among coastlines and significantly divergent among marine, freshwater and estuarine habitats even at the family level. Furthermore, biodiversity varied substantially across two seasons reaching a beta diversity of 0.9 in a sub-Arctic port exposed to high vessel traffic. Metabarcoding offers a powerful and sensitive approach to conduct large-scale biodiversity surveys and allows comparability across studies when rooted in taxonomy. We highlight ways of overcoming current limitations of metabarcoding for identifying species and assessing biodiversity, which has important implications for detecting organisms at low abundance such as endangered species and early invaders. Our study conveys pertinent and timely considerations for future large-scale monitoring surveys in relationship to environmental change.","Chain, F.J.J.; Brown, E.A.; MacIsaac, H.J.; Cristescu, M.E.",WOS:000374158100001,"Chain, Frédéric, F.J.J.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12427,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,18S; biodiversity; bioinformatics; biomonitoring; DNA barcoding; OTU clustering,Journal article,,,"McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",Canada,18S; biodiversity; bioinformatics; biomonitoring; DNA barcoding; OTU clustering,BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT; DNA BARCODES; PERFORMANCE; IDENTIFICATION; MAGNITUDE; PRIMERS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,McGill University,,Canada,,University,Science

Great strides have been made in the past decade establishing a framework for sharing data, where taxonomy and systematics has been perceived as the most prominent discipline involved. To some extent this is inevitable, given the use of species names as the pivot around which information is organised. To address the urgent questions around conservation, land-use, environmental change, sustainability, food security and ecosystem services that are facing Governments worldwide, we need to understand how the ecosystem works. So, we need a systems approach to understanding biodiversity that moves significantly beyond taxonomy and species observations. Such an approach needs to look at the whole system to address species interactions, both with their environment and with other species. It is clear that some barriers to progress are sociological, basically persuading people to use the technological solutions that are already available. This is best addressed by developing more effective systems that deliver immediate benefit to the user, hiding the majority of the technology behind simple user interfaces. An infrastructure should be a space in which activities take place and, as such, should be effectively invisible. This community consultation paper positions the role of biodiversity informatics, for the next decade, presenting the actions needed to link the various biodiversity infrastructures invisibly and to facilitate understanding that can support both business and policy-makers. The community considers the goal in biodiversity informatics to be full integration of the biodiversity research community, including citizens’ science, through a commonly-shared, sustainable e-infrastructure across all sub-disciplines that reliably serves science and society alike.","Hardisty, A.; Roberts, D.",WOS:000318501200001,"Hardisty, Alex, A.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/1472-6785-13-16,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; Informatics; Grand challenge; Decadal vision; Research infrastructure; e-Infrastructure; Data sharing; Systems approaches,Journal article,,,"Cardiff Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Queens Bldg 5, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales.",Wales,Biodiversity; Informatics; Grand challenge; Decadal vision; Research infrastructure; e-Infrastructure; Data sharing; Systems approaches,CITIZEN SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; NETWORK; BIG,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Cardiff University,,UK,,University,Science

Extreme bias in shell use pattern by male and female of both species of hermit crabs suggests that shell shape, which depends on shell species, is the major determinant of shell use. The hermit crab must however fit well into the shell so that compatibility between crab size and shell size becomes crucial.

The crayfish make an exceptional group to demonstrate the utility of the synthesis approach, as there recently have been a number of phylogenetic studies on the crayfishes along with a robust underlying taxonomic framework. Importantly, the crayfish have also been extensively assessed by an IUCN Red List team and therefore have accurate and up-to-date area and conservation status data available for analysis within a phylogenetic context. Here, we develop a synthesis phylogeny for the world's freshwater crayfish and examine the phylogenetic distribution of threat.

Information on the spatial and temporal variability of the composition and structure of coralligenous assemblages is essentially lacking for most regions. We explored the variability of the biodiversity patterns of coralligenous outcrops dominated by the red gorgonian <i>Paramuricea clavata</i> in the NW Mediterranean region using a hierarchical sampling design. The study addressed two overlooked spatial and temporal scales: from 1 to >100 km and a 5-year period. Overall, no temporal changes were detected in either species composition or the 12 morphofunctional groups considered. Significant differences in species composition were found at the various spatial scales. However, variation in composition at the locality level (>100 km apart) showed the lowest values in comparison with the differences found at the site level (<1 km apart). Despite the differences, the sites displayed high similarity (average similarity 55.7 %) and shared approximately 50 % of the species. Similarly, the patterns of diversity at different scales, the alpha (site) and gamma (locality) were consistent with the specific composition trends, whereas the beta diversity showed the greatest differences among sites. Our results demonstrate the moderate spatial variability in biodiversity in the NW Mediterranean region and an extremely low temporal variability. This study provides baselines for detecting potential effects due to global change, and it furnishes a basis for the implementation of monitoring schemes of coralligenous assemblages. The development of similar sampling schemes in other Mediterranean regions will provide a global view of the biodiversity of coralligenous outcrops.","Casas-Güell, E.; Teixidó, N.; Garrabou, J.; Cebrián, E.",WOS:000351227900015,"Casas-Güell, Edgar, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-015-2635-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",Spain,,ROCKY BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; MEDITERRANEAN RED CORAL; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; BETA DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; VARIABILITY; MORTALITY; INSIGHTS; HABITAT,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

A weak and/or apparently continuous variation in shell characters has resulted in an intimidating taxonomy, with complex synonymy lists. Over 1320 extant nominal species have been described, of which 442 are currently regarded as valid. Above species level, the state of the art is equally hazy, with four subfamilies and twelve genera currently accepted, and many other names in the graveyard of synonymy.

Species of <i>Antillophos, Engoniophos, Phos, Nassaria, Tomlinia</i> and <i>Anentome</i> (formerly considered Buccinidae) are included inside the Nassariidae clade.

Through an integrative approach, the reconstruction of ancestral states was addressed for eight characters supposedly informative for taxonomy.

Here, we test the monophyly and phylogenetic position of Cryptochiridae using the same gene, but with an extended representation of cryptochirids spanning nine species in eight of 21 genera, in addition to further thoracotreme representatives. The results show that gall crabs form a highly supported monophyletic clade within the Thoracotremata, which evolved independently of grapsid crabs. Therefore, the Cryptochiridae should not be considered as highly modified Grapsidae, but as an independent lineage of Thoracotremata, deserving its current family rank. Further molecular and morphological studies are needed to elucidate the precise placement of the cryptochirids within the Eubrachyura.","van der Meij, S.E.T.; Schubart, C.D.",WOS:000346194000003,"van der Meij, Sancia, S.E.T.","Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1071/is13064,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"16S mtDNA, coral-associated organisms, evolutionary origin, superfamily.",Journal article,,,"Nat Biodivers Ctr, Dept Marine Zool, Darwinweg 2, NL-2333 CR Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,16S mtDNA; coral-associated organisms; evolutionary origin; superfamily,FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE-SYSTEM; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CRUSTACEA; MORPHOLOGY; JACQUINOT; PATTERNS; POSITION; HOMBRON; GENUS,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Naturalis Biodiversity Center,,Netherlands,,Museum,Science

Reef corals are normally considered to tolerate only a narrow range of climatic conditions with only a small number of species considered heat-tolerant. Occasionally however, corals can be seen thriving in unusually harsh reef settings and these are cause for some optimism about the future of coral reefs. Here we document for the first time a diverse assemblage of 225 species of hard corals occurring in the intertidal zone of the Bonaparte Archipelago, north western Australia. We compare the environmental conditions at our study site (tidal regime, SST and level of turbidity) with those experienced at four other more typical tropical reef locations with similar levels of diversity. Physical extremes in the Bonaparte Archipelago include tidal oscillations of up to 8 m, long subaerial exposure times (>3.5 hrs), prolonged exposure to high SST and fluctuating turbidity levels. We conclude the timing of low tide in the coolest parts of the day ameliorates the severity of subaerial exposure, and the combination of strong currents and a naturally high sediment regime helps to offset light and heat stress. The low level of anthropogenic impact and proximity to the Indo-west Pacific centre of diversity are likely to further promote resistance and resilience in this community. This assemblage provides an indication of what corals may have existed in other nearshore locations in the past prior to widespread coastal development, eutrophication, coral predator and disease outbreaks and coral bleaching events. Our results call for a re-evaluation of what conditions are optimal for coral survival, and the Bonaparte intertidal community presents an ideal model system for exploring how species resilience is conferred in the absence of confounding factors such as pollution.","Richards, Z.T.; Garcia, R.A.; Wallace, C.C.; Rosser, N.L.; Muir, P.R.",WOS:000350168700038,"Richards, Zoe, Z.T.","Western Australian Museum, Dept Aquat Zool, Welshpool, WA 6016, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0117791,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Western Australian Museum, Dept Aquat Zool, Welshpool, WA 6016, Australia.",Australia,,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; KO PHUKET; BIODIVERSITY; CNIDARIA; PATTERNS; MARINE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Western Australian Museum,,Australia,,Museum,Science

The current project studied for the first time how megabenthic community structure is related to several environmental factors over 2000 km of the Canadian Arctic, from the Beaufort Sea to northern Baffin Bay. Faunal trawl samples were collected between 2007 and 2011 at 78 stations from 30 to 1000 m depth and patterns in biomass, density, richness, diversity, and taxonomic composition were examined in relation to indirect/spatial gradients (e.g., depth), direct gradients (e.g., bottom oceanographic variables), and resource gradients (e.g., food supply proxies). Six benthic community types were defined based on their biomass-based taxonomic composition. Their distribution was significantly, but moderately, associated with large-scale (100–1000 km) environmental gradients defined by depth, physical water properties (e.g., bottom salinity), and meso-scale (10–100 km) environmental gradients defined by substrate type (hard vs. soft) and sediment organic carbon content. We did not observe a strong decline of bulk biomass, density and richness with depth or a strong increase of those community characteristics with food supply proxies, contrary to our hypothesis. We discuss how local- to meso-scale environmental conditions, such as bottom current regimes and polynyas, sustain biomass-rich communities at specific locations in oligotrophic and in deep regions of the Canadian Arctic. This study demonstrates the value of considering the scales of variability of environmental gradients when interpreting their relevance in structuring of communities.","Roy, V.; Iken, K.; Archambault, P.",WOS:000339618600009,"Roy, Virginie, V.","Univ Quebec, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0100900,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Quebec, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",Canada,,BEAUFORT SEA; BARENTS SEA; MEGAFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES; EPIBENTHIC MEGAFAUNA; BENTHIC ECOLOGY; ORGANIC-MATTER; WATER POLYNYA; CHUKCHI SEAS; NORTH WATER; CARBON FLUX,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Quebec - Institut des Sciences de la Mer de Rimouski (ISMER),,Canada,,Research institute,Science

Quantitative genetic theory suggests that the sex under historically stronger directional selection will exhibit greater interspecific variance in size, with covariation between allometric slopes (male to female size) and the strength of SSD across clades. Rensch's rule (RR) also suggests a correlation, but one in which males are always the more size variant sex. Examining free-living pelagic and parasitic Copepoda, we test these competing predictions. Females are commonly the larger sex in copepod species. Comparing clades that vary by four orders of magnitude in their degree of dimorphism, we show that isometry is widespread. As such we find no support for either RR or for covariation between allometry and SSD. Our results suggest that selection on both sexes has been equally important. We next test the prediction that variation in the degree of SSD is related to the adult sex ratio. As males become relatively less abundant, it has been hypothesized that this will lead to a reduction in both inter-male competition and male size. However, the lack of such a correlation across diverse free-living pelagic families of copepods provides no support for this hypothesis. By comparison, in sea lice of the family Caligidae, there is some qualitative support of the hypothesis, males may suffer elevated mortality when they leave the host and rove for sedentary females, and their female-biased SSD is greater than in many free-living families. However, other parasitic copepods which do not appear to have obvious differences in sex-based mate searching risks also show similar or even more extreme SSD, therefore suggesting other factors can drive the observed extremes.","Hirst, A.G.; Kiorboe, T.",WOS:000341094800003,"Hirst, A.G.","Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rspb.2014.0739,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Copepoda,,,"sexual size dimorphism, allometry sex, ratio, Copepoda",Journal article,,,"Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",England,sexual size dimorphism; allometry; Zsex ratio; Copepoda,MARINE PLANKTONIC COPEPODS; LEPEOPHTHEIRUS-SALMONIS; GLOBAL RATES; PELAGIC COPEPOD; CHLOROPHYLL-A; MATE CHOICE; ALLOMETRY; SELECTION; RATIOS; TEMPERATURE,Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Queen Mary University of London (QMUL),,UK,,University,Science

Subsequently, a shell-swapping experiment and repeated measures test of the SMR of crabs occupying both types of shells were made to test if differences in the SMR were a consequence of the shell occupied (plasticity) or a result of an intrinsic variation between individuals (consistency). Crabs occupying broken shells had a lower metabolism than those in intact shells. The gradual recovery of the SMR of the crabs swapped to broken shells to similar metabolic levels of those of crabs tested in intact shells suggests that though the use of a broken shell can be disadvantageous in the wild, broken shells might produce a more benign situation under laboratory conditions. The depression of the SMR may act as an adaptive response to cope with the disadvantages caused by broken shells in a challenging environment.

With the exception of JSTOR Plant Science, most international initiatives seek long-term business models and funding mechanisms to provide online data openly and free of charge. For example, currently GBIF depends on governmental commitments for its funding, and CoL is financed by EU or national grants, as well as being based on Species 2000, a British non-for-profit company, and ITIS. These business models are compared with that of JSTOR Plant Science, the commercial portal of the Global Plant Initiative (GPI). All initiatives currently meet challenges of sustainability with regard to data curation as well as software development for maintaining the complexity of their services. All platforms discussed here also harvest and provide mycological and lichenological research data.","Triebel, D.; Hagedorn, G.; Rambold, G.",WOS:000209434200003,"Triebel, Dagmar, D.","Bavarian Nat Hist Collect, IT Ctr, Munich, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/mycokeys.5.4302,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Internet Platforms for Natural Sciences, BHL, CoL, EOL, GBIF, iBOL, JSTOR Plant Science, INSDC, DDBJ, EMBL, GenBank, Barcoding, Data Flow, Research Data",Journal article,,,"Bavarian Nat Hist Collect, IT Ctr, Munich, Germany.",Germany,Internet Platforms for Natural Sciences; BHL; CoL; EOL; GBIF; iBOL; JSTOR Plant Science; INSDC; DDBJ; EMBL; GenBank; Barcoding; Data Flow; Research Data,,Mycology,Mycology,Bavarian Natural History Collections (SNSB),,Germany,,Research institute,Science

At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs’ shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions.","Zettler, M.L.; Bochert, R.; Pollehne, F.",WOS:000323002600014,"Zettler, M.L.","Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res IOW, Dept Biol, D-18119 Warnemunde, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2989/1814232x.2013.798592,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Mollusca, ""Peracarida"", ""Polychaeta""",,," Angola, macrozoobenthos, Mollusca, Namibia, oxygen minimum zone, Peracarida, Polychaeta",Journal article,,,"Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res IOW, Dept Biol, Seestr 15, D-18119 Warnemunde, Germany.",Germany,Angola; macrozoobenthos; Mollusca; Namibia; oxygen minimum zone; Peracarida; Polychaeta,FRONTAL ZONE; ANGOLA; NAMIBIA; AFRICA; FAUNA; SHELF; FISH; ZOOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; DIVERSITY,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research (IOW),,Germany,,Research institute,Science

A total of 104 loggerhead turtles stranded along the coasts of eastern Spain during 1995–2006 were surveyed for epibionts. A total of 39 epibiont taxa were identified, three of them being new records for loggerhead turtles: <i>Bittium </i>sp.,<i> Idotea metallica</i> and Jassa sp. The assemblage was composed of a group of 27 facultative taxa that use turtles as any inanimate buoyant substrate, and 12 taxa that have developed more specific associations to marine turtles, including six species that occur in marine turtles exclusively, two that dwell also on other hosts, and four that can also survive as free-living forms but have developed a strong association with marine turtles. Hierarchical clustering and Similarity Profile Analysis based on the occurrence of 166 epibiont taxa from nine available surveys indicated that the epibiont assemblages from loggerhead turtles in the western Mediterranean (WM) are similar to those from Central Mediterranean (CM), but significantly different from turtles surveyed in the eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The subset of epibionts occurring on WM and CM turtles is defined by a combination of geographic factors (exclusive Mediterranean epibiont taxa) and ecological factors (relative absence of littoral-benthic taxa).

There was little difference between the epipelic diatom species present in intertidal and subtidal areas and, because many of the species have a high tolerance to salinity, with some being found in conditions ranging from freshwater to a salinity of more than 150 psu, it was concluded that many of the species sampled do not appear to be reliable indicators for assessing salinity in South African estuaries. Although there was a wide spread of diatoms across all of the estuaries around the coast, the greatest species similarity occurred between the Olifants, Great Berg and Breede estuaries, suggesting that the Breede Estuary, normally considered to fall within the warm temperate region, may be more similar to the cool temperate type estuaries.

Utilizing a combination of shell characteristics, a molecular marker (mitochondrial <i>cox1</i> gene) and phylogenetic analysis, we identified a mangrove-distributed novel <i>Crassostrea</i> oyster species, <i>C. dianbaiensis</i>. The shell morphology of the new species is phenoplastic, as seen in other congeneric oysters. The left valve of this oyster is usually deeply cupped, and the right valve is usually slightly concave. The body size is classified as medium and is approximately 5–10 cm in height (estimated from 20 individuals). One distinctive feature of <i>C. dianbaiensis</i> is that the adductor muscle scars vary in color from dark purple to white in the right valve, but always appear white in the left valve. Based on the <i>cox1</i> phylogenetic tree, <i>C. dianbaiensis</i> is inferred to be a new member of the Southeast Asia tropical oysters and is believed to be the northernmost distributed species among the tropical oysters.

The present study investigated alien biodiversity in Mediterranean marine caves, both by contributing new records of Eastern Mediterranean cave aliens, and by reviewing the scattered existing literature; the main goals were to highlight potential impacts and investigate the importance of cave environments for the expansion of alien species. Seven new alien species were found in marine caves of the Aegean and Ionian seas, raising the total number of aliens reported from Mediterranean marine caves to 56 species, classified as molluscs, cnidarians, bryozoans, polychaetes, crustaceans, macroalgae, fishes and tunicates. Most cave aliens (66%) were recorded from the Southeastern Levantine coasts, specifically from Lebanese caves. Shipping and Lessepsian migration have been suggested as the main pathways of alien introduction into caves of the Mediterranean Sea. The comparison of alien cave biodiversity with the updated Mediterranean alien inventory (32 species added to the latest inventory) showed similar patterns and trends for species richness, biogeographical origin and major introduction pathways, corroborating previous findings on the high local representativeness of Mediterranean cave biodiversity. Alien species seem to have invaded mostly the entrance and semi-dark zones of shallow and/or semi-submerged caves and tunnels, whereas only a few have reached the dark inner sectors or caves of the anchialine type; thus, the unfavourable cave environment seems to be naturally protected from impacts related to opportunistic invasive species, at least to a certain point. Currently there is no research confirming any direct impacts of alien biota on the native cavernicolous one. However, some issues have emerged, implying potential threats that need to be further explored: (i) the presence of a considerable proportion of aliens in most studied marine caves of the Southeastern Mediterranean basin, (ii) the recently observed population explosion of alien cave-dwelling fishes in the same area, (iii) several indications that alien diversity in marine caves is much higher than we know today. Quantitative surveys and monitoring schemes are needed in order to evaluate potential effects of alien diversity on cave community structure and the role of marine caves as stepping stones for its expansion in the Mediterranean.","Gerovasileiou, V.; Voultsiadou, E.; Issaris, Y.; Zenetos, A.",WOS:000374977500001,"Gerovasileiou, Vasilis, V.","Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, Iraklion, Crete, Greece.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/maec.12268,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; invasions; marine aliens; marine caves; Mediterranean Sea,Journal article,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, Iraklion, Crete, Greece.",Greece,Biodiversity; invasions; marine aliens; marine caves; Mediterranean Sea,CORAL OCULINA-PATAGONICA; SHALLOW SUBMARINE CAVE; COASTAL HABITATS; SEA; RECORDS; LEBANON; MOLLUSCA; PATTERNS; ANCHIALINE; POLYCHAETA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR),,,,,

Data generated from imagery includes identification, annotation and quantification of biological subjects and environmental features within an image. To be long-lived and useful beyond their project-specific initial purpose, and to maximize their utility across studies and disciplines, marine imagery data should use a standardised vocabulary of defined terms. This would enable the compilation of regional, national and/or global data sets from multiple sources, contributing to broad-scale management studies and development of automated annotation algorithms. The classification scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI) project provides such a vocabulary. The CATAMI classification scheme introduces Australian-wide acknowledged, standardised terminology for annotating benthic substrates and biota in marine imagery. It combines coarse-level taxonomy and morphology, and is a flexible, hierarchical classification that bridges the gap between habitat/biotope characterisation and taxonomy, acknowledging limitations when describing biological taxa through imagery. It is fully described, documented, and maintained through curated online databases, and can be applied across benthic image collection methods, annotation platforms and scoring methods. Following release in 2013, the CATAMI classification scheme was taken up by a wide variety of users, including government, academia and industry. This rapid acceptance highlights the scheme’s utility and the potential to facilitate broad-scale multidisciplinary studies of marine ecosystems when applied globally.

During the DIVA 1 cruise of RV METEOR (July/August 2000) to the Angola Basin (Southeast Atlantic), two deep-sea stations, approximately 300 nautical miles apart (Stations 325 and 346), were sampled repeatedly by Multicorer (MUC). For quantitative analyses, 5 MUC samples were selected at random from each of 15 deployments at both stations, totalling 75 cores. Across the study, 7,081 Harpacticoida specimens were encountered and of these 31.4 % were adults and could be analysed to species level: 682 species were identified, with 99.3 % new to science. At northern Station 346, a total of 600 species were recorded—the highest harpacticoid species number ever recorded for a single deep-sea locality. Most species (56 %) were represented by singletons. Multivariate tests identified significant differences between community compositions at the two stations. Diversity, species richness and species density were higher at Station 346, whilst taxonomic distinctness, evenness, and rarefaction were similar between stations. Regression and correlation analyses showed that the difference in species diversity was best explained by species densities rather than species richness. Under-sampling due to low densities was an issue at the southern Station 325. Nevertheless, our study demonstrated significant differences in regional-scale harpacticoid community structures within a single deep-sea basin that would usually be considered a uniform and stable habitat. These observed differences are thought to reflect differences in food availability at the two stations.","George, K.H.; Veit-Köhler, G.; Arbizu, P.M.; Seifried, S.; Rose, A.; Willen, E.; Bröhldick, K.; Corgosinho, P.H.; Drewes, J.; Menzel, L.; Moura, G.; Schminke, H.K.",WOS:000332585400006,"Bröhldick, Karin, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s13127-013-0154-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Meiofauna, Community analysis, Species richness, Diversity, DIVA, CeDAMar",Journal article,,,"Abt DZMB, Sudstrand 44, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",Germany,Meiofauna; Community analysis; Species richness; Diversity; DIVA; CeDAMar,MEIOFAUNA COMMUNITIES; ANCORABOLINAE SARS; METAZOAN MEIOFAUNA; INCLUDING REMARKS; STANDING STOCK; SP-N; ABYSSAL; MEIOBENTHOS; PATTERNS; SHELF,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Senckenberg - German Center for Marine Biodiversity Research (DZMB),x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

MNI values for archaeological molluscan assemblages are routinely calculated by counting a select range of Non-Repetitive Elements (NREs). Most commonly, only the frequency of the spire of gastropods and the umbo or hinge of bivalves are recorded. Calculating MNI based only on the frequency of these NREs can underestimate the relative abundance of particular molluscan shell forms. Using archaeological mollusc assemblages from two sites in the Marshall Islands as a case study, we outline a new protocol (tMNI) that incorporates a wider range of NRE and calculates MNI based on the most frequently occurring NRE for each taxon. The principles that underlie the tMNI method can be modified to be regionally or assemblage specific, rather than being a universally applicable range of NRE for the calculation of MNI. For the Marshall Islands assemblages, the inclusion of additional NRE in quantification measures led to (1) a 167% increase in relative abundance of gastropods and 3% increase in bivalves (2) changes to rank order abundance, and (3) alterations to measures of taxonomic richness and evenness. Given these results for the Marshall Islands assemblages, tMNI provides more accurate taxonomic abundance measures for these and other archaeological molluscan assemblages with similar taxa. These results have implications for the quality of zooarchaeological data increasingly utilised by conservation biologists, historical ecologists and policy makers.","Harris, M.; Weisler, M.; Faulkner, P.",WOS:000355028900016,"Harris, Matthew, M.","Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jas.2015.01.017,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Mollusc quantification, Minimum Numbers of Individuals (MNI), Shell middens, Marshall Islands, Analytical transparency",Journal article,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",Australia,Mollusc quantification; Minimum Numbers of Individuals (MNI); Shell middens; Marshall Islands; Analytical transparency,BLUE MUD BAY; FORAGING EFFICIENCY; BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; WESTERN KIRIBATI; DIET BREADTH; BASE-LINE; MICRONESIA; STRATEGIES; MARINE; EXPLOITATION,"Anthropology; Archaeology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Anthropology; Archaeology; Geology,University of Queensland,,Australia,,University,Science

While recognizing the value of the clam for aquaculture, the government decided that it posed no invasive risk, as British sea temperatures would prevent naturalization. This proved incorrect. Here we establish the pattern of introduction and spread of the species over the first 30 years of its presence in Britain. We report archival research on the sequence of licensed introductions and examine their relationship in time and space to the appearance of wild populations as revealed in the literature and by field surveys. By 2010 the species had naturalized in at least 11 estuaries in southern England. These included estuaries with no history of licensed introduction. In these cases activities such as storage of catch before market or deliberate unlicensed introduction represent the probable mechanisms of dispersal. In any event naturalization is not an inevitable consequence of introduction and the chances of establishment over the period in question were finely balanced. Consequently in Britain the species is not currently aggressively invasive and appears not to present significant risk to indigenous diversity or ecosystem function. However it is likely to gradually continue its spread should sea surface temperatures rise as predicted.","Humphreys, J.; Harris, M.R.C.; Herbert, R.J.H.; Farrell, P.; Cragg, S.M.",WOS:000358846800011,"Humphreys, John, J.","Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Portsmouth PO4 9LY, Hants, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315415000132,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Manila clam; Ruditapes philippinarum; invasion; naturalization;non-indigenous species; British estuaries,Journal article,,,"Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Ferry Rd, Portsmouth PO4 9LY, Hants, England.",England,Manila clam; Ruditapes philippinarum; invasion; naturalization; non-indigenous species; British estuaries,TAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; BAY,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Portsmouth - Institute of Marine Science (IMS),,UK,,Research institute,Science

Information on this is limited for offshore platforms in the southern North Sea.

A Generalised Additive Model of the species richness showed a significant non-linear relation with water depth (p = 0.001): from a low richness in shallow waters it increases with depth until 15–20 m, after which richness decreases again. Using PERMANOVA, water depth (p≤0.001), community age (p≤0.001) and the interaction between distance from shore and community age (p≤0.001) showed a significant effect on the species assemblages.

To address this question, a multifactorial hierarchical sampling design, across three of the major marine biogeographic boundaries in the central Mediterranean Sea (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian, Tyrrhenian-Ionian and Ionian-Adriatic) was carried out. Mitochondrial COI sequence polymorphism of seven species of Mediterranean benthic invertebrates was analysed. Two species showed significant genetic structure across the Tyrrhenian-Ionian boundary, as well as two other species across the Ionian Sea, a previously unknown phylogeographic barrier. The hypothesized barrier in the Ligurian-Tyrrhenian cannot be detected in the genetic structure of the investigated species. Connectivity patterns across species at distances up to 800 km apart confirmed that estimates of pelagic larval dispersal were poor predictors of the genetic structure. The detected genetic discontinuities seem more related to the effect of past historical events, though maintained by present day oceanographic processes. Multivariate statistical tools were used to test the consistency of the patterns across species, providing a conceptual framework for across-species barrier locations and strengths. Additional sequences retrieved from public databases supported our findings.

Detailed previous studies using molecular techniques identified several clades within <i>Hydra</i>, but how these are related to described species remained largely an open question. In the present study, we compiled all published sequence data for three mitochondrial and nuclear genes (COI, 16S and ITS), complemented these with some new sequence data and delimited main genetic lineages (=hypothetical species) objectively by employing two DNA barcoding approaches. Conclusions on the species status of these main lineages were based on inferences of reproductive isolation. Relevant divergence times within<i> Hydra</i> were estimated based on relaxed molecular clock analyses with four genes (COI, 16S, EF1α and 28S) and four cnidarians fossil calibration points All in all, 28 main lineages could be delimited, many more than anticipated from earlier studies. Because allopatric distributions were common, inferences of reproductive isolation often remained ambiguous but reproductive isolation was rarely refuted. Our results support three major conclusions which are central for <i>Hydra</i> research: (1) species level diversity was underestimated by molecular studies; (2) species affiliations of several crucial ‘workhorses’ of <i>Hydra</i> evolutionary research were wrong and (3) crown group <i>Hydra</i> originated ∼200 mya. Our results demonstrate that the taxonomy of <i>Hydra</i> requires a thorough revision and that evolutionary studies need to take this into account when interspecific comparisons are made. <i>Hydra</i> originated on Pangea. Three of four extant groups evolved ∼70 mya ago, possibly on the northern landmass of Laurasia.

An analysis of the abundance of 54 phytoplankton species in Galicia (NW Spain) between 1989 and 2008 to determine the main components of temporal variability in relation to climate and upwelling showed that most of this variability was stochastic, as seasonality and long term trends contributed to relatively small fractions of the series. In general, trends appeared as non linear, and species clustered in 4 groups according to the trend pattern but there was no defined pattern for diatoms, dinoflagellates or other groups. While, in general, total abundance increased, no clear trend was found for 23 species, 14 species decreased, 4 species increased during the early 1990s, and only 13 species showed a general increase through the series. In contrast, series of local environmental conditions (temperature, stratification, nutrients) and climate-related variables (atmospheric pressure indices, upwelling winds) showed a high fraction of their variability in deterministic seasonality and trends. As a result, each species responded independently to environmental and climate variability, measured by generalized additive models. Most species showed a positive relationship with nutrient concentrations but only a few showed a direct relationship with stratification and upwelling. Climate variables had only measurable effects on some species but no common response emerged. Because its adaptation to frequent disturbances, phytoplankton communities in upwelling ecosystems appear less sensitive to changes in regional climate than other communities characterized by short and well defined productive periods.","Bode, A.; Estévez, M.G.; Varela, M.; Vilar, J.A.",WOS:000362304700010,"Estévez, M.

Nevertheless, emergent assemblage attributes exhibited spatial constancy: values of assemblage metrics (faunal abundance, species richness, species density and species diversity) did not differ across the site or across spatial scales, and neither did the patterns of dispersion of species diversity, species richness or observed species density.

Experimental plots with increasing cover of oysters were established within two estuaries in two different habitats commonly inhabited by <i>C. gigas</i>, (mussel-beds and mud-flats) and were sampled after 4 and 15 months. Within mud-flat habitats, macroscopic species living on or in the substratum increased in richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and number of individuals with oyster cover. In mussel-bed habitats, however, these indices were unaffected by the cover of oysters except at one estuary after 15 months when species richness was significantly lower in plots with the greatest cover of oysters. Assemblage structure differed with oyster cover in mud-flats but not in mussel-beds, except at 100 % cover in one location and at one time. Within mud-flats at one location and time (of four total tests), assemblages became more homogenous with increasing cover of oysters leading to a significant decrease in β-diversity. These responses were primarily underpinned by the facilitation of several taxa including a grazing gastropod (<i>Littorina littorea</i>), an invasive barnacle (<i>Austrominius modestus</i>) and a primary producer (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>) with increasing cover of oysters. Although there were consistent positive effects of <i>C. gigas</i> on mud-flat biodiversity, effects were weak or negative at higher cover on mussel-beds.

Neither densities and species richnesses of epifauna and infauna nor species composition varied significantly by vegetation type. Multivariate analyses of macrofaunal assemblage structure and abiotic/biotic environmental factors demonstrated that seagrass aboveground biomass explained a significant proportion of the multivariate variation in epifaunal species composition (39%); none of the potential explanatory variables was related to variation in ecological parameters of the infauna. Thus, seagrass specific identity is not a good predictor of either macrofaunal abundance or diversity patterns.

This region is therefore very important for the early detection of alien species entering the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal and it is imperative that monitoring of alien species is continued in order to assess the levels of biological invasion. We present results of marine alien surveys, carried out in April 2014 on the island of Rodos. Surveys were performed by a team of marine taxonomic experts and students as part of an EU wide training school, coordinated by the COST Action TD1209 “Alien Challenge”. A variety of survey methods were employed to cover a number of coastal habitats. These included: rapid assessment surveys of epibiota on artificial structures in harbours, rapid assessment snorkelling surveys of biota on sublittoral bedrock, and quantified fishing surveys (both boat-seine and trammel net fishing methods). A total of 33 alien and cryptogenic species were recorded across all the survey techniques. Of these species, 9 represented first records for Rodos: the foraminiferan <i>Amphisorus hemprichii</i>, the polychaetes <i>Branchiomma bairdi</i>, <i>Dorvillea similis, Hydroides dirampha</i> and <i>Pseudonereis anomala</i>, the molluscs <i>Aplysia parvula</i>, <i>Chama pacifica</i> and <i>Septifer cumingii</i>, and the bryozoan <i>Hippopodina feegeensis</i>. Of note the record of the Lessepsian invader <i>Dorvillea similis</i> represents the second record in the Mediterranean Sea. Alien fish species represented a small but notable proportion of the diversity, biomass and number of individuals in fishing catch of both fishing methods. All alien fish species observed were already known to be present in Rodos. The addition of species firstly recorded in this study brings the total number of marine alien and cryptogenic species in the Dodecanese region up to 129 species. The vast majority of these alien species have entered unaided via the Suez Canal, but an increasing number have been introduced through hull fouling or ballast water transfer from shipping. The results highlight the value of conducting marine alien surveys with teams of a diverse range of taxonomic expertise, both in its scientific output and student training.","Corsini-Foka, M.; Zenetos, A.; Crocetta, F.; Çinar, M.E.; Koçak, F.; Golani, D.; Katsanevakis, S.; Tsiamis, K.; Cook, E.; Froglia, C.; Triandaphyllou, M.; Lakkis, S.; Kondylatos, G.; Tricarico, E.; Zuljevic, A.; Almeida, M.; Cardigos, F.; Çaglar, S.; Durucan, F.; Fernandes, A.M.D.; Ferrario, J.; Haberle, I.; Louizidou, P.; Makris, J.; Maric, M.; Micu, D.; Mifsud, C.; Nall, C.; Kytinou, E.; Poursanidis, D.; Spigoli, D.; Stasolla, G.; Yapici, S.; Roy, H.E.",WOS:000422635600004,"Stasolla, Gianluca, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3391/mbi.2015.6.4.04,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,COST Action Alien Challenge; Rodos; Mediterranean; biological invasions;rapid assessment,Journal article,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, Hydrobiol Stn Rhodes, Cos St, Rhodes 85100, Greece.",Greece,COST Action Alien Challenge; Rodos; Mediterranean; biological invasions; rapid assessment,,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,HCMR (Hellenic Centre for Marine Research) - Institute of Oceanography (IO),x,Greece,,Research institute,Science

Two mitochondrial gene markers (COI and 16S) and one nuclear ribosomal gene (28S) from six Atlantic species of <i>Scaphander</i>, and four IWP species were used to generate a multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis using uncorrelated relaxed-clock Bayesian methods implemented in beast and calibrated with the first occurrence of <i>Scaphander</i> in the fossil record (58.7–55.8 Ma). Two main clades were supported: clade A, with sister relationships between species and subclades from the Atlantic and IWP; and clade B, with two western Atlantic sister species. Our estimates indicate that the two earliest divergences in clade A occurred between the middle Eocene and late Miocene and the most recent speciation occurred within the middle Miocene to Pleistocene. The divergence between the two western Atlantic species in clade B was estimated at late Oligocene–Pliocene. The prevailing mode of speciation in <i>Scaphander</i> was allopatric, but one possible case of sympatric speciation was detected between two western Atlantic species. Sister relationships between IWP and Atlantic lineages suggest the occurrence both of vicariance events caused by the closure of the Tethyan Seaway and of dispersal between the two ocean basins, probably around South Africa during episodic disruptions of the deep-sea regional current system caused by glacial–interglacial cycles. Cladogenetic estimates do not support comparatively older diversification of deep-sea faunas, but corroborate the hypothesis of a pulse of diversification centred in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Amphi-Atlantic species were found to occur at deeper depths (bathyal–abyssal) and we hypothesize that trans-Atlantic connectivity is maintained by dispersal between neighbouring reproductive populations inhabiting the abyssal sea floor and by dispersal across the shelf and slope of Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.","Eilertsen, M.H.; Malaquias, M.A.E.",WOS:000352793700004,"Eilertsen, Mari, M.H.","Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Marine Biodivers Res Grp, N-5006 Bergen, Norway.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jbi.12471,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Cephalaspidea, ""Heterobranchia"", ""Mollusca""",,,Allopatric speciation; amphi-Atlantic; Cephalaspidea; dispersal; diversification pulse; Heterobranchia; marine biogeography; Mollusca; Tethyan vicariance,Journal article,,,"Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Marine Biodivers Res Grp, PB 7803, N-5006 Bergen, Norway.",Norway,Allopatric speciation; amphi-Atlantic; Cephalaspidea; dispersal; diversification pulse; Heterobranchia; marine biogeography; Mollusca; Tethyan vicariance,POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION DECREASES; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; LARVAL DISPERSAL; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; LATE MIOCENE; NEW-ZEALAND; DIVERSITY; PLIOCENE; ORIGIN,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,University of Bergen,,Norway,,University,Science

Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5–10°C, <i>S</i> = 10–25) compared to more open coastal waters (0–5°C, <i>S</i>>27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N values (−25.6‰ to −27.4‰ and 1.4‰ to 3.3‰, respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (−24.8‰ to −25.4‰ and 3.4‰ to 5.3‰, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon.

Because of difficulties in species identification, little is known about species-dependent sediment reworking and solute transport. The closely related species are apparently similar in feeding and sediment-dwelling behavior, but size and burrowing depth indicate differences in bioturbation and the biogeochemical consequences thereof. To investigate these potential differences, a tracer experiment with artificial particles (luminophores) and solute tracer (bromide) was conducted. Polychaetes were identified to species level using a molecular genetic key. Modeled results show that all three species display markedly low particle reworking rates with biodiffusion coefficients (<i>Db</i>) of 1.76 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (<i>M. viridis</i>) and 0.07 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (<i>M. neglecta</i>) at an abundance of 1273 individuals m<sup>−2</sup> and 0.44 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (<i>M. arctia</i>) at twice that abundance.

Hong Kong provides a unique opportunity to assess this relationship. Here, coastal waters have been monitored monthly since 1986, at 76 stations, providing a highly spatially resolved water quality dataset including 68 903 data points. Moreover, a robust coral species richness (<i>S</i>) dataset is available from more than 100 surveyed locations, composed of 3453 individual colonies' observations, as well as a coral cover (CC) dataset including 85 sites. This wealth of data provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that water quality, and in particular nutrients, drives coral biodiversity. The influence of water quality on <i>S</i> and CC was analyzed using GIS and multiple regression modeling. Eutrophication (as chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration; CHLA) was negatively correlated with <i>S</i> and CC, whereas physicochemical parameters (DO and salinity) had no significant effect. The modeling further illustrated that particulate suspended matter, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) had a negative effect on <i>S</i> and on CC; however, the effect of nutrients was 1.5-fold to twofold greater. The highest <i>S</i> and CC occurred where CHLA &lt;2 <i>μ</i>g L<sup>−1</sup>, DIN &lt; 2 <i>μ</i>m and DIP &lt; 0.1 <i>μ</i>m.

The species was first observed in North America near Delaware Bay (39°N, 75°W) in 1988, and a variety of evidence suggests initial introduction via ballast water early in that decade. The crab spread rapidly after its discovery, and breeding populations currently extend from North Carolina to Maine (35°–45°N). <i>H. sanguineus</i> is now the dominant crab in rocky intertidal habitat along much of the northeast coast of the USA and has displaced resident crab species throughout this region.

Invasive populations now extend along 1000 km of coastline from the Cotentin Peninsula in France to Lower Saxony in Germany (48°–53°N). Success of the Asian shore crab in alien habitats has been ascribed to factors such as high fecundity, superior competition for space and food, release from parasitism, and direct predation on co-occurring crab species. Laboratory and field observations indicate that <i>H. sanguineus</i> is a generalist predator with potential for substantial effects on sympatric populations of mollusks and crustaceans. However, broad ecosystem effects and actual economic impact are unclear. The literature on <i>H. sanguineus</i> is limited in comparison to better known invasive species like the European green crab (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>) and the Chinese mitten crab (<i>Eriocheir sinensis</i>).

However, the degree and magnitude to which the presence of these sponge grounds elicits large changes in composition of the associated megafaunal community remains unknown. Here we identify the external drivers of epibenthic megafaunal community composition and explore the patterns and magnitude of compositional change in the megafaunal community within the sponge grounds of the Sackville Spur, northwest Atlantic. Epibenthic megafauna were quantified from five image transects collected on the Sackville Spur in 2009 between 1080 and 1723 m depth. Using Gradient Forest Modelling we found that the abundance of structure-forming sponges was the most important variable for predicting compositional patterns in the Sackville Spur megafaunal community, followed by depth, range in bottom current speed, in situ salinity, and longitude. Along the gradient in structure-forming sponge abundance, the largest turnover in megafaunal community composition occurred when the sponges reached 15 individuals m<sup>−2</sup>.

Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of <i>C. funebralis</i> populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of <i>C. funebralis</i>, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming.","Gleason, L.U.; Burton, R.S.",WOS:000326430500043,"Gleason, Lani, L.U.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.08.008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,,,"Heat stress, Local adaptation, Mollusk, Rocky intertidal, Thermal tolerance",Journal article,,,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0202, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",USA,Heat stress; Local adaptation; Mollusk; Rocky intertidal; Thermal tolerance,ACCLIMATION-INDUCED VARIATION; POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; NORTHERN ACORN BARNACLE; ALLELE FREQUENCY CLINE; GENUS TEGULA; LATITUDINAL VARIATION; THERMAL LIMITS; SHOCK RESPONSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOW,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of California - San Diego,,USA,,University,Science

In particular, Muricidae produce a suite of brominated indoles with anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and steroidogenic activity, as well as choline esters with muscle-relaxing and pain relieving properties. These compounds could explain some of the traditional uses in wound healing, stomach pain and menstrual problems.

This study presents the results of applying the hierarchical European Nature Information System (EUNIS) to classify and map the benthic habitats of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, a marine protected area (MPA), located in the mainland Portuguese southwest coast, in the Iberian Peninsula. The habitat map was modelled by applying a methodology based on EUNIS to merge biotic and abiotic key habitat drivers. The modelling in this approach focused on predicting the association of different data types: substrate, bathymetry, light intensity, waves and currents energy, sediment grain size and benthic macrofauna into a common framework. The resulting seamless medium scale habitat map discriminates twenty six distinct sublittoral habitats, including eight with no match in the current classification, which may be regarded as new potential habitat classes and therefore will be submitted to EUNIS. A discussion is provided examining the suitability of the current EUNIS scheme as a standardized approach to classify marine benthic habitats and map their spatial distribution at medium scales in the Portuguese coast. In addition the factors that most affected the results available in the predictive habitat map and the role of the environmental factors on macrofaunal assemblage composition and distribution are outlined.","Henriques, V.; Guerra, M.T.; Mendes, B.; Gaudèncio, M.J.; Fonseca, P.",WOS:000358461200008,"Guerra, Miriam Tuaty, M.T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2014.10.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"EUNIS, Marine habitat mapping, Marine protected area, Benthic macrofauna, Acoustic remote sensing, Portuguese continental waters",Journal article,,,"Inst Portugues Mar & Atmosfera, Ave Brasilia, P-1449006 Lisbon, Portugal.",Portugal,EUNIS; Marine habitat mapping; Marine protected area; Benthic macrofauna; Acoustic remote sensing; Portuguese continental waters,ACOUSTIC SEABED CLASSIFICATION; WAVE EXPOSURE; BACKSCATTER; BATHYMETRY; BIOTOPES; ROXANN; LIDAR; REEF,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA),x,Portugal,,Research institute,Science

Surprisingly, in bivalves remarkable interspecific differences were found among the eight mussels and between the two clams in which histone H3 gene clusters have already been located. Although the family Veneridae comprises 10 % of the species of marine bivalves, their chromosomes are poorly studied. The clams belonging to this family present 2n = 38 chromosomes and similar karyotypes showing chromosome pairs gradually decreasing in length. In order to assess the evolutionary behavior of histone and rRNA multigene families in bivalves, we mapped histone H3 and ribosomal RNA probes to chromosomes of ten species of venerid clams. In contrast with the reported conservation of histone H3 gene clusters and their intercalary location in invertebrates, these loci varied in number and were mostly subterminal in venerid clams. On the other hand, while a single 45S rDNA cluster, highly variable in location, was found in these organisms, 5S rDNA clusters showed interspecific differences in both number and location. The distribution patterns of these sequences were species-specific and mapped to different chromosomal positions in all clams but <i>Ruditapes decussatus</i>, in which one of the minor rDNA clusters and the major rDNA cluster co-located. The diversity in the distribution patterns of histone H3 gene, 5S rDNA and 28S rDNA clusters found in venerid clams, together with their different evolutionary behaviors in other invertebrate taxa, strongly suggest that the control of the spreading of these multigene families in a group of organisms relies upon a combination of evolutionary forces that operate differently depending not only on the specific multigene family but also on the particular taxa. Our data also showed that H3 histone gene and rDNA clusters are useful landmarks to integrate nex-generation sequencing (NGS) and evolutionary genomic data in non-model species.","García-Souto, D.; Pérez-García, C.; Móran, P.; Pasantes, J.J.",WOS:000356759400001,"Móran, Paloma, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s13039-015-0150-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Veneridae,,,"Venerid clams, Chromosome, Fluorescent in situ hybridization, Histone genes, Ribosomal RNA genes",Journal article,,,"Univ Vigo, Dept Bioquim Xenet & Inmunol, E-36310 Vigo, Spain.",Spain,Venerid clams; Chromosome; Fluorescent in situ hybridization; Histone genes; Ribosomal RNA genes,RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENES; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; TELOMERIC SEQUENCES; 5S RDNA; BIVALVIA; PHYLOGENY; MOLLUSCA; ORGANIZATION; EDULIS; REARRANGEMENTS,Genetics & Heredity,Genetics & Heredity,University of Vigo - Department of Bioquim Xenet & Inmunoloxia,x,Spain,,University,Science

Records of <i>P. gibbesi</i> (a conspicuous number of specimens) constitute the first for the archipelago. All the species included in the present paper were recorded after the Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area was established, with the first record dating back to 2000. This is presumably due to the recent increase in research programs on marine reserves. Finally, we provide the establishment status of all the recorded species updated to 2015, and discuss why unaided spread (whether alien or native) and/or transport-stowaway constitute the more plausible vectors of introduction.","Mannino, A.M.; Parasporo, M.; Crocetta, F.; Balistreri, P.",WOS:000403061500024,"Mannino, Anna Maria, A.M.","Univ Palermo, Sect Bot & Plant Ecol, Dept Biol Chem & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Via Archirafi 38, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-016-0496-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area, Italy, Mediterranean Sea, Review, Marine alien and cryptogenic species ",Journal article,,,"Univ Palermo, Sect Bot & Plant Ecol, Dept Biol Chem & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Via Archirafi 38, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",Italy,Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Review; Marine alien and cryptogenic species,ALGA CAULERPA-TAXIFOLIA; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; ASPARAGOPSIS-TAXIFORMIS; 1ST RECORD; APLYSIA; BONNEMAISONIALES; BIODIVERSITY; CHLOROPHYTA; RHODOPHYTA; INVASION,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Palermo,,Italy,,University,Science

Patterns of larval development varied both within a single brood and among broods of different females. Continuous reproduction of <i>B. proboscidea</i> coupled with a continuous supply of organic matter could explain the possible mechanism that led to the development of reefs.","Jaubet, M.L.; Garaffo, G.V.; Vallarino, E.A.; Elias, R.",WOS:000358729600029,"Jaubet, María, M.L.","Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras IIMyC, Lab Bioindicadores Benton, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/maec.12170,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Boccardia proboscidea,,,Boccardia proboscidea; morphology; poecilogony; strategy reproductive; SW Atlantic,Journal article,,,"Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras IIMyC, Dept Ciencias Marinas, Dean Funes 3350,B 7602 AYL, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",Argentina,Boccardia proboscidea; morphology; poecilogony; strategy reproductive; SW Atlantic,POLYDORID SPECIES POLYCHAETA; ABALONE HALIOTIS-MIDAE; SOUTH-AFRICA; POECILOGONOUS POLYCHAETE; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; NORTH-AMERICA; POPULATION; MODES; PLANKTOTROPHY; LECITHOTROPHY,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,National University of Mar del Plata,,Argentina,,University,Science

We used massive V9 18S rDNA sequencing from 106 size-fractionated plankton communities collected across the world's surface oceans during the Tara Oceans expedition (2009–2012) to assess patterns of pelagic dinoflagellate diversity and community structuring over global taxonomic and ecological scales. Our data and analyses suggest that dinoflagellate diversity has been largely underestimated, representing overall ∼1/2 of protistan rDNA metabarcode richness assigned at ≥ 90% to a reference sequence in the world's surface oceans. Dinoflagellate metabarcode diversity and abundance display regular patterns across the global scale, with different order-level taxonomic compositions across organismal size fractions. While the pico to nano-planktonic communities are composed of an extreme diversity of metabarcodes assigned to Gymnodiniales or are simply undetermined, most micro-dinoflagellate metabarcodes relate to the well-referenced Gonyaulacales and Peridiniales orders, and a lower abundance and diversity of essentially symbiotic Peridiniales is unveiled in the meso-plankton. Our analyses could help future development of biogeochemical models of pelagic systems integrating the separation of dinoflagellates into functional groups according to plankton size classes.","Le Bescot, N.; Mahé, F.; Audic, S.; Dimier, C.; Garet, M.-J.; Poulain, J.; Wincker, P.; de Vargas, C.; Siano, R.",WOS:000371232600027,"Garet, Marie-José, M.-J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1462-2920.13039,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"IFREMER, Dyneco PELAGOS, BP 70, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",France,,SP-NOV DINOPHYCEAE; RIBOSOMAL-RNA SEQUENCES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; COASTAL WATERS; SPECIES DINOPHYCEAE; MARINE; EUKARYOTES; ALIGNMENT; PICOEUKARYOTES,Microbiology,Microbiology,,,,,,

We hypothesised that: (1) the presence of corals at a nursery is critical to recruit fish assemblages and (2) the recruited fish assemblages control biofouling, reducing person-hours invested in nursery cleaning. Three midwater coral nurseries were deployed at 8 m depth for 27 months within the marine protected area of Cousin Island Special Reserve, Seychelles, Indian Ocean. Each nursery consisted of a 6 m×6 m PVC pipe frame, layered with a recycled 5.5-cm-mesh tuna net. Human cleaning effort was calculated based on daily dive logs. Nursery-associated fish assemblages and behaviour were video-recorded prior to harvesting corals after a 20-month growth period and seven months post-coral harvesting. The density (ind. m–2) of blue-yellow damselfish <i>Pomacentrus caeruleus</i> was 12–16 times higher when corals were present than when corals were absent at the nurseries. Fish assemblages recruited into the nurseries included three trophic levels, from herbivores to omnivores, in six families: Ephippidae, Pomacentridae, Labridae (Scarinae), Gobiidae, Siganidae and Monacanthidae.

In order to assess the susceptibility of marine habitats to biological invasions, a dataset was gathered of the occurrence of 3899 species from 29 phyla, taken from 93 marine sites located along the Italian coast in the period 2000–2012. In total, 61 AS belonging to 11 phyla have been recorded. Invertebrates were the most represented (63%). Alien species were found in all the habitats examined (EUNIS, level 2), although they showed highest abundance in benthic habitats. Most of the AS were associated with a single EUNIS habitat, while some of them were present in more than one habitat. Trans-habitat occurrence suggests the potential invasiveness of AS. According to statistical analysis, AS recorded could have been more numerous, since some of the marine habitats seemed to be still unsaturated. The model that best describes the spread of AS takes account of both native species richness (Rn) and EUNIS habitat type as explanatory variables. The number of observed AS was directly related to Rn and it was highest in rocky circalittoral and infralittoral habitats. The results of this macro-ecological study focus on the importance of performing large-scale studies, since adopting ecosystem approaches to marine invasion management seems especially fruitful. The results, moreover, highlight the importance of AS monitoring of different habitats, from those subjected to anthropogenic pressure, historically considered to be hubs of introduction of AS, to the most biologically rich and diverse marine habitats. Indeed, it is necessary to set monitoring strategies to detect the introduction, the distribution and persistence of AS over time. These recommendations are especially significant in the light of the strategic plans currently under formulation in Mediterranean countries with regard to AS monitoring.","Corriero, G.; Pierri, C.; Accoroni, S.; Alabiso, G.; Bavestrello, G.; Barbone, E.; Bastianini, M.; Bazzoni, A.M.; Bernardi Aubry, F.; Boero, F.; Buia, M.C.; Cabrini, M.; Camatti, E.; Cardone, F.; Cataletto, B.; Cattaneo-Vietti, R.; Cecere, E.; Cibic, T.; Colangelo, P.; de Olazabal, A.; D'Onghia, G.; Finotto, S.; Fiore, N.; Fornasaro, D.; Fraschetti, S.; Gambi, M.C.; Giangrande, A.; Gravili, C.; Guglielmo, R.; Longo, C.; Lorenti, M.; Lugliè, A.; Maiorano, P.; Mazzocchi, M.G.; Mercurio, M.; Mastrototaro, F.; Mistri, M.; Monti, M.; Munari, C.; Musco, L.; Nonnis-Marzano, C.; Padedda, B.M.; Patti, F.P.; Petrocelli, A.; Piraino, S.; Portacci, G.; Pugnetti, A.; Pulina, S.; Romagnoli, T.; Rosati, I.; Sarno, D.; Satta, C.T.; Sechi, N.; Schiaparelli, S.; Scipione, B.; Sion, L.; Terlizzi, A.; Tirelli, V.; Totti, C.; Tursi, A.; Ungaro, N.; Zingone, A.; Zupo, V.; Basset, A.",WOS:000373957200015,"Lugliè, Antonella, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/aqc.2550,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,marine alien species; Mediterranean EUNIS habitats; habitat vulnerability; invasive alien species; invasion,Journal article,,,"Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Biol, Bari, Italy.",Italy,marine alien species; Mediterranean EUNIS habitats; habitat vulnerability; invasive alien species; invasion,RACEMOSA VAR.

In many cases delimitations rely on subjective interpretations of morphological and/or DNA data. Species with inadequate genetic resources needed to answer questions regarding evolutionary relatedness and genetic uniqueness are particularly problematic. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to objectively resolve unambiguous phylogenetic relationships in a recalcitrant group of deep-sea corals with divergences >80 million years. We infer robust species boundaries in the genus <i>Paragorgia</i> by testing alternative delimitation hypotheses using a Bayes Factors delimitation method. We present substantial evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus and infer the presence of cryptic species associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but are contingent on taxon-specific factors. We show that classical taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypotheses.

To assess the potential impacts of such a scenario, this study examined the population demographics of <i>T. noae</i> within the center of its geographic distribution in the Kavieng lagoonal system of New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea. The study found that 42% of the <i>T. maxima</i> sensu Rosewater population could be delineated as <i>T. noae</i>, with <i>T. noae</i> being the most abundant giant clam species at 7 of the 20 study sites.

Thus, in areas where the two species have overlapping distributions and fisheries regulations are based on size, reassessment of <i>T. maxima</i> stocks should be considered a priority given the high frequency at which the larger <i>T. noae</i> may comprise historical populations of <i>T. maxima</i> sensu Rosewater.","Militz, T.A.; Kinch, J.; Southgate, P.C.",WOS:000360410500015,"Militz, Thane, T.A.","James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.034.0215,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Tridacna maxima, ""Tridacna noae""",,,"giant clam, Tridacna noae, Tridacna maxima, demographics, density, distribution, management, Papua New Guinea",Journal article,,,"James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Australia,giant clam; Tridacna noae; Tridacna maxima; demographics; density; distribution; management; Papua New Guinea,GIANT CLAMS; RANGE,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,James Cook University,,Australia,,University,Science

The study is based on a total of 557 samples collected between 1996 and 2007. Over 1200 colonies and 70 taxa of Hydrozoa were collected by SCUBA divers, dredges and van Veen grabs. The distribution patterns with respect to major environmental factors were studied based on presence/absence data. Four substrate types were most commonly colonized by hydroid colonies: algae, bryozoans, rocks and hydrozoans. The highest species richness was noted on algae and rocks. Shallow water communities of the study area were characterized by a high hydroid species richness. A number of species decrease along the depth gradient. Some species have shown some preferences towards selected substrates or one of the two depth zones, but most hydroid species were generalists in terms of both the depth and substrate preferences. No species could be classified as substrate-specific (i.e. occurring only on one substrate type). The substrate heterogeneity was shown to be an important driver of hydroid species richness in Arctic coastal waters.","Ronowicz, M.; Wlodarska-Kowalczuk, M.; Kuklinski, P.",WOS:000315395700015,"Ronowicz, Marta, M.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/maec.12034,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; ecology; environmental factors; epifauna; habitat; Spitsbergen,Journal article,,,"Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Ul Powstancow Warszawy 55, PL-81712 Sopot, Poland.",Poland,Biodiversity; ecology; environmental factors; epifauna; habitat; Spitsbergen,ATHECATE HYDROIDS; SHELF WATERS; DIVERSITY; KONGSFJORDEN; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; ASSOCIATIONS; COMMUNITIES; MACROALGAE; BOTTOM,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IOPAN),,Poland,,Research institute,Science

It has extensively radiated within the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, to which it is endemic. In this paper we present a synthetic overview of existing information on this radiation together with new information on estimated species diversity, systematic relationships, a species-level molecular phylogenetic analysis and preliminary macroecological and diversification analyses, to serve as a platform for further study. We currently estimate that about 300 species (122 extant) are known from its 36 million year history but this number will undoubtedly increase as we extend our studies. We discuss the relationships of <i>Polystira</i> to other Neotropical Turridae (s.s.) and examine the taxonomy and systematics of the geologically oldest described members of the clade. To aid taxonomic description of shells we introduce a new notation for homologous major spiral cords. Focusing on key publications, we discuss in detail the changing historical understanding of the taxonomy of the clade and the relationships of its component genus-level taxa: <i>Polystira</i> Woodring, 1928, <i>Pleuroliria</i> de Gregorio, 1890, Josephina Gardner, 1945 and <i>Oxytropa</i> Glibert, 1955. We designate a neotype for <i>Pleurotoma (Pleuroliria) supramirifica</i> de Gregorio, 1890, to stabilize our understanding of this, the type species of <i>Pleuroliria</i>. Application of the name <i>Oxytropa</i> is restricted to the type species. The genus <i>Polystira</i> is conchologically re-described and for the first time we synthesize available information on the anatomy, feeding and toxinology, reproduction and life history, larval modes and life habits, and geographic and bathymetric ranges of its species. We give an updated list of the 19 formally described living species and present the pitfalls of the currently poor species-level taxonomy of <i>Polystira</i> using case examples. We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 22 extant species using three mitochondrial gene fragments (COI, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA). This reveals undescribed species and indicates that Recent genetic clades (‘biospecies’) are consistent with finely divided conchological ‘morphospecies’. Historically, there has been a slow realisation of the high species diversity of the <i>Polystira</i> clade and we consider that this may be due to inadequate precision of morphological description of shells and a lack of clear homology statements. We suggest how these both might be improved. Finally, using a data compilation based on museum specimens  we examine species range-size distributions and species abundance distributions for 85 of the 112 extant western Atlantic species that we have delimited to date. Our results indicate that the majority of species are rare and have short geographic ranges; only a few are wide-ranging and abundant. This has important implications for surveys of biodiversity.","Todd, J.A.; Rawlings, T.A.",WOS:000345966100005,"Todd, Jonathan, J.A.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zootaxa.3884.5.5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Pleuroliria, ""Polystira"", ""Turridae""",,,"Turridae, Polystira, Pleuroliria, systematics, homology, molecular phylogenetics, species hyper-diversity, radiation, Neotropics, Americas, geographic range, species abundance, diversification dynamics",Journal article,,,"Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",England,Turridae; Polystira; Pleuroliria; systematics; homology; molecular phylogenetics; species hyper-diversity; radiation; Neotropics; Americas; geographic range; species abundance; diversification dynamics,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; SPECIES DELIMITATION; SPIRAL CORDS; NEOGENE; PATTERNS; STRATIGRAPHY; BOUNDARIES; SPECIATION; MURICIDAE; DIVERSITY,Zoology,Zoology,Natural History Museum (NHM),,,,,

Cell volume varied between 454 and 18,439 μm<sup>3</sup> and whilst C and N content were proportional to the cell volume, DMSP content was not. The first DMSP measurements for a dinoflagellate from Antarctic waters and a species with diatom-like plastids are included. Lower DMSP concentrations were found in three small athecate species and a dinoflagellate with haptophyte-like plastids. The highest concentrations and production rates tended to be in globally distributed dinoflagellates and the heterotroph. Photosynthetic species that are distributed in temperate to tropical waters showed low DMSP concentrations and production rates and the polar representative showed moderate concentration and a low production rate. Estuarine species had the lowest concentrations and production rates.

Here we present the most extensive examination of model-based historical biogeography among marine invertebrates to date. We conducted the largest phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses to date for the bivalve family Cardiidae (cockles and giant clams) with three unlinked loci for 110 species representing 37 of the 50 genera. Ancestral ranges were reconstructed using the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) method with a time-stratified paleogeographic model wherein dispersal rates varied with shifting tectonics. Results were compared to previous classifications and the extensive paleontological record. Six of the eight prior subfamily groupings were found to be para- or polyphyletic. Cardiidae originated and subsequently diversified in the tropical Indo-Pacific starting in the Late Triassic. Eastern Atlantic species were mainly derived from the tropical Indo-Mediterranean region via the Tethys Sea. In contrast, the western Atlantic fauna was derived from Indo-Pacific clades.

In this article we present new data retrieved from unpublished archives on the burial excavation, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the <i>Conus</i> found with the infant, and a second similar <i>Conus</i> that probably originates from the same layer. Based on morphological, morphometric and ecological evidence we assign these two shells to <i>Conus ebraeus</i> Linnaeus 1758, a tropical species still living on the nearest coastline to Border Cave, in northern KwaZulu-Natal. This attribution changes the paleoclimatic setting inferred from the previous ascription of these shells to <i>Conus bairstowi</i>, a species endemic to the Eastern Cape and adapted to colder sea surface temperatures. Reconstructions of 74 ka sea surface temperatures along the southern African east coast are consistent with our reassignment. Analysis of shell thanatocoenoses and biocoenosis from the KwaZulu-Natal coast, including microscopic study of their surfaces, reveals that complete, well preserved living or dead <i>Conus</i>, such as those found at Border Cave, are rare on beaches, can be collected at low tide at a depth of c. 0.5–2 m among the rocks, and that the archeological shells were dead when collected. We demonstrate that the perforations at the apex were produced by humans, and that traces of wear due to prolonged utilization as an ornament are present. SEM-EDX analysis of patches of red residue on the <i>Conus</i> found in the pit with the infant indicates that it is composed of iron, phosphorus, silicon, aluminium, and magnesium.

An internationally well-established marine biotic index, AMBI, commonly applied to assess ecological quality status was adapted for use on benthic foraminifera. As required by the AMBI formula, species were assigned to one of five ecological groups according to their sensitivity/tolerance to conditions along an increasing stress gradient (here increasing organic matter enrichment). For the assignments, we used 19 published data sets on fully marine NE Atlantic and Arctic fjord, continental shelf, and slope assemblages for which total organic carbon (TOC) data were available. Assignments were based on the relative abundance of the different species along associated TOC gradients. Of the 128 assigned species, the majority was assigned to Groups I–III dominating in low to moderately organic enriched environments with a high to good ecological quality status. Groups IV and V, representing strongly organically enriched environments with a moderate to poor ecological quality status, had 1 and 2 species, respectively. The resulting foraminifera-based Foram-AMBI was calculated using the AMBI formula and tested on four independent foraminiferal data sets from the same geographical region. The validation included correlations of the Foram-AMBI with Shannon's diversity (H′log2) as well as with the organic carbon content in the validation data sets. In two validation data sets from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, a high proportion of the assemblages consisted of assigned species. The results showed a good correlation between the Foram-AMBI and both the TOC and Shannon's diversity H′log2. In two more southern validation data sets all TOC values were low and the abundance of unassigned species was too high for the Foram-AMBI to provide trustworthy results. The Foram-AMBI of the two validation data sets with high abundance of assigned species clearly reflected an increasing organic carbon-induced stress gradient. Hence, this first attempt to apply the AMBI formula on benthic foraminiferal data shows promising results. However, to improve the applicability of Foram-AMBI, there is a need to assign more species by obtaining data from studies along wide organic carbon pressure gradients, particularly from the southern North Sea and southwards.","Alve, E.; Korsun, S.; Schönfeld, J.; Dijkstra, N.; Golikova, E.; Hess, S.; Husum, K.; Panieri, G.",WOS:000368964500001,"Dijkstra, Noortje, N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2015.11.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Foraminifera,,,    Benthic foraminifera; Environmental monitoring; Marine biotic indices; Foram-AMBI; Water Framework Directive,Journal article,,,"Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Box 1047 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",Norway,Benthic foraminifera; Environmental monitoring; Marine biotic indices; Foram-AMBI; Water Framework Directive,MARINE BIOTIC INDEX; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; NE ATLANTIC; SEA; MARGIN; MICROHABITATS; ASSEMBLAGES; NORWAY; ENVIRONMENTS,Paleontology,Paleontology,University of Oslo - Department of Geoscience,x,Norway,,University,Science

Whether species are internal or external fertilizers is a fundamental aspect of reproductive diversity in the sea, and has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, geographic variation in this trait and the factors that potentially drive it (e.g. transitions in associated life-history traits, ecological conditions that favour one mode over the other or the evolutionary history of species) remain poorly characterized. We collated life-history data (modes of fertilization and development), geographic data and biophysical data (sea-surface temperatures and food availability) for 1532 marine species spanning 17 invertebrate phyla. We used standard and phylogenetic logistic regressions to evaluate latitudinal gradients in fertilization mode, plus their interactions with development (transitions from planktonic to aplanktonic development, or from feeding to non-feeding larvae) and taxonomy. We also explored the dependence of fertilization mode on biophysical variables to understand how ecology potentially contributes to geographic variation in this trait. Fertilization mode often varies predictably with latitude, but the exact nature of this relationship depends on developmental mode and the phylum under consideration. Some commonalities were evident, however, with the likelihood of internal fertilization declining at higher latitudes for Annelida and Echinodermata with aplanktonic development, but increasing at higher latitudes for Cnidaria and Porifera with non-feeding, planktonic larvae. Synergistic effects of temperature and food availability may potentially shape some of these patterns. There are latitudinal gradients in fertilization mode in the sea. The variation among phyla and developmental modes, however, is a complexity that is unexplained by existing theory. Combined effects of recent adaptation and deeper phylogenetic history have probably shaped this systematic variation in the reproductive ecology of marine organisms.","Monro, K.; Marshall, D.J.",WOS:000367668000013,"Monro, Keyne, K.","Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12358,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Developmental mode; fertilization mode; functional biogeography; life histories; marine invertebrates; metazoans; reproductive strategies,Journal article,,,"Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",Australia,Developmental mode; fertilization mode; functional biogeography; life histories; marine invertebrates; metazoans; reproductive strategies,LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; DEVELOPMENTAL MODE; LARVAL DISPERSAL; OFFSPRING SIZE; PARENTAL CARE; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; PHYLOGENY; FISH,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Monash University,,Australia,,University,Science

The control of mosquito-borne diseases is facing a number of crucial challenges, including the emergence of artemisinin and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium parasites, as well as the presence of mosquito vectors resistant to synthetic and microbial pesticides. Therefore, eco-friendly tools are urgently required. Here, a synergic approach relying to nanotechnologies and biological control strategies is proposed. The marine environment is an outstanding reservoir of bioactive natural products, which have many applications against pests, parasites, and pathogens. We proposed a novel method of seaweed-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the spongeweed <i>Codium tomentosum</i>, acting as a reducing and capping agent. AgNP were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In mosquitocidal assays, the 50 % lethal concentration (LC50) of <i>C. tomentosum</i> extract against <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> ranged from 255.1 (larva I) to 487.1 ppm (pupa). LC50 of <i>C. tomentosum</i>-synthesized AgNP ranged from 18.1 (larva I) to 40.7 ppm (pupa). In laboratory, the predation efficiency of <i>Mesocyclops aspericornis</i> copepods against <i>A. stephensi</i> larvae was 81, 65, 17, and 9 % (I, II, III, and IV instar, respectively). In AgNP contaminated environment, predation was not affected; 83, 66, 19, and 11 % (I, II, III, and IV). The anti-plasmodial activity of <i>C. tomentosum</i> extract and spongeweed-synthesized AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) of <i>C. tomentosum</i> were 51.34 μg/ml (CQ-s) and 65.17 μg/ml (CQ-r); <i>C. tomentosum</i>-synthesized AgNP achieved IC50 of 72.45 μg/ml (CQ-s) and 76.08 μg/ml (CQ-r). Furthermore, low doses of the AgNP inhibited the growth of <i>Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Salmonella typhi</i>, using the agar disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration protocol. Overall, <i>C. tomentosum</i> metabolites and spongeweed-synthesized AgNP may be potential candidates to develop novel and effective tools in the fight against <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites and their mosquito vectors. The employ of ultra-low doses of nanomosquitocides in synergy with cyclopoid crustaceans seems a promising green route for effective mosquito control programs.","Murugan, K.; Panneerselvam, C.; Subramaniam, J.; Madhiyazhagan, P.; Hwang, J.-S.; Wang, L.; Dinesh, D.; Suresh, U.; Roni, M.; Higuchi, A.; Benelli, G.; Nicoletti, M.",WOS:000381156600081,"Murugan, Kadarkarai, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11356-016-6832-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Anopheles stephensi, ""Codium tomentosum"", ""Mesocyclops aspericornis"", ""Plasmodium falciparum""",,,"Anopheles stephensi, Codium tomentosum, Malaria, Mosquito-borne diseases, Plasmodium falciparum, Mesocyclops aspericornis, Anti-bacterial activity ",Journal article,,,"St Anna Sch Adv Studies, BioRobot Inst, Viale Rinaldo Piaggio 34, I-56025 Pontedera, Italy.",Italy,Anopheles stephensi; Codium tomentosum; Malaria; Mosquito-borne diseases; Plasmodium falciparum; Mesocyclops aspericornis; Anti-bacterial activity,THURINGIENSIS VAR.

The abundance and original nature of the specimens prompted us to undertake a deep survey of both morphological and molecular traits aiming at a reliable systematisation of the new taxon. Using several microscopical techniques we investigated the external and internal anatomy, including the muscular and nervous systems of the new species. Additional specimens were used to obtain the 18S rRNA gene sequence; molecular data was analysed cladistically in conjunction with data from additional species belonging to the near complete Macrodasyida taxonomic spectrum. Specimens are vermiform, up to 806 μm in total length, and show a well-defined head equipped with peculiar leaf-like sensorial organs and a single-lobed posterior end. The adhesive apparatus includes anterior, ventrolateral, dorsal and posterior tubes. Pharynx is about 1/4 of the total length and shows pores at its posterior 3/4. Adult specimens exhibit maturing eggs and a bulky, muscular caudal organ, but do not show sperm nor the frontal organ. Musculature and nervous system organisation resemble the usual macrodasyidan plan; however, the somatic circular muscles of the intestinal region surround all other muscular components and a third FMRFamide-IR commissure ventral to the pharyngo-intestinal junction appear to be an autoapomorphic traits of the new species. While the anatomical characteristics of the Asian specimens appear so unique to grant the establishment of a new taxon, for which the name <i>Thaidasys tongiorgii</i> gen. et sp. nov. is proposed, the result of phylogenetic analyses based on the 18S rRNA gene unites the new genus with the family Macrodasyidae.","Todaro, M.A.; Dal Zotto, M.; Leasi, F.",WOS:000358159700027,"Todaro, M.

The view of organic falls as “stepping stones” for the colonization of deep-sea reducing environments has been often loosely used, but much remains to be proven concerning their capability to bridge dispersal among such environments. Aiming the clarification of this issue, we used an experimental approach to answer the following questions: Are relatively small organic falls in the deep sea capable of sustaining taxonomically and trophically diverse assemblages over demographically relevant temporal scales? Are there important depth- or site-related sources of variability for the composition and structure of these assemblages? Is the proximity of other reducing environments influential for their colonization? We analysed the taxonomical and trophic diversity patterns and partitioning (α- and β-diversity) of the macrofaunal assemblages recruited in small colonization devices with organic and inorganic substrata after 1-2 years of deployment on mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cádiz. Our results show that small organic falls can sustain highly diverse and trophically coherent assemblages for time periods allowing growth to reproductive maturity, and successive generations of dominant species. The composition and structure of the assemblages showed variability consistent with their biogeographic and bathymetric contexts. However, the proximity of cold seeps had limited influence on the similarity between the assemblages of these two habitats and organic falls sustained a distinctive fauna with dominant substrate-specific taxa. We conclude that it is unlikely that small organic falls may regularly ensure population connectivity among cold seeps and vents. They may be a recurrent source of evolutionary candidates for the colonization of such ecosystems. However, there may be a critical size of organic fall to create the necessary intense and persistent reducing conditions for sustaining typical chemosymbiotic vent and seep organisms.","Cunha, M.R.; Matos, F.L.; Génio, L.; Hilario, A.; Moura, C.J.; Ravara, A.; Rodrigues, C.F.",WOS:000325434500082,"Matos, Fábio, F.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0076688,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal.",Portugal,,WOOD-BORING BIVALVES; WHALE-FALL; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; SEEP COMMUNITIES; PLANT REMAINS; MUD VOLCANOS; DWARF MALES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Aveiro - Department of Biology,x,Portugal,,University,Science

This contrasts to other invertebrate groups (e.g. corals, sponges and bryozoans), where unequal rates of speciation, extinction and migration have resulted in greater diversity in the Caribbean than in the Pacific. The earliest published article that included work on echinoderms from Panama dates back to Addison Emery Verrill in 1867, where he described new genera and species. This began a period of exploration during which most echinoderms species from Panamanian waters were described. From its inception in 1961, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute marine program in Panama has generated extensive ecological and evolutionary echinoderm research. This includes work on species distributions, population sizes, reproductive cycles, grazing and food preferences, associated organisms, bioerosion, and species die-offs. The majority of molecular phylogeographic studies in Panama have focused on echinoids, with only a few molecular studies on asteroids and ophiuroids, and none on crinoids or holothuroids.

Since climate changes cause a progressive expansion of ice-free intertidal soft-bottom areas, the fauna of these areas could serve as essential criterion to evaluate the kind and dimension of such changes. We therefore investigated the faunal composition of the intertidal soft-bottom area of Maxwell Bay (King George Island, South Shetlands) in December 2006. Samples for quantitative analyses were taken from the soft-bottom during low tide using a plastic corer. We performed detailed analyses of the soft-bottom beneath a cobble layer, while hard-bottom and macrophytes were only sporadically investigated. Approximately 5,000 specimens were collected of which polychaetes (37.3 ± 7.6 (max. 44.7) ind. × 100 cm−³) and harpacticoids (28.9 ± 28.5 (max. 104.0) ind. × 10 cm−³) were the most abundant macro- and meiofauna taxa of the soft-bottom, followed by oligochaetes, nematodes, mollusks, and amphipods. A total of 58 macrofauna species were registered, of which 27 were identified only to a supraspecific level.

Their growth and biochemical composition are affected by surrounding environmental conditions, including temperature, which continues to increase as a result of climate warming. Increasing water temperatures may negatively impact the production of EFA by phytoplankton through the process of homeoviscous adaptation. To investigate this, we conducted an exploratory data synthesis with 952 fatty acid (FA) profiles from six major groups of marine and freshwater phytoplankton. Temperature was strongly correlated with a decrease in the proportion of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC-PUFA) and an increase in omega-6 FA and saturated FA. Based on linear regression models, we predict that global n-3 LC-PUFA production will be reduced by 8.2% for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 27.8% for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with an increase in water temperature of 2.5 °C. Using a previously published estimate of the global production of EPA by diatoms, which contribute to most of the world's supply of EPA, we predict a loss of 14.2 Mt of EPA annually as a result of ocean warming. The n-3 LC-PUFA are vitally important for an array of key physiological functions in aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and these FA are mainly produced by phytoplankton. Therefore, reduced production of these EFA, as a consequence of climate warming, is predicted to negatively affect species that depend on these compounds for optimum physiological function. Such profound changes in the biochemical composition of phytoplankton cell membranes can lead to cascading effects throughout the world's ecosystems.","Hixson, S.M.; Arts, M.T.",WOS:000380016800009,"Hixson, Stefanie, S.M.","Ryerson Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.13295,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,climate change; docosahexaenoic acid; eicosapentaenoic acid; globalwarming; omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,Journal article,,,"Ryerson Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",Canada,climate change; docosahexaenoic acid; eicosapentaenoic acid; global warming; omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; FRESH-WATER; FOOD-WEB; TEMPERATURE; TERRESTRIAL; ADAPTATION; PHOSPHORUS; SIGNATURES; RESPONSES; PROFILES,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Ryerson University,,Canada,,University,Science

A species' response to stress depends on its life history. Sensitivity to harvesting is related to the life history “fast–slow” continuum, where “slow” species (i.e., large, long lived, and late maturing) are expected to be more sensitive to fishing than “fast” ones. We analyze life history traits variation for all common fish species in the Barents Sea and rank fishes along fast–slow gradients obtained by ordination analyses. In addition, we integrate species' fast–slow ranks with ecosystem survey data for the period 2004–2009, to assess life history variation at the community level in space and time. Arctic fishes were smaller, had shorter life spans, earlier maturation, larger offspring, and lower fecundity than boreal ones. Arctic fishes could thus be considered faster than the boreal species, even when body size was corrected for. Phylogenetically related species possessed similar life histories. Early in the study period, we found a strong spatial gradient, where members of fish assemblages in the southwestern Barents Sea displayed slower life histories than in the northeast. However, in later, warmer years, the gradient weakened caused by a northward movement of boreal species. As a consequence, the northeast experienced increasing proportions of slower fish species. This study is a step toward integrating life history traits in ecosystem-based areal management. On the basis of life history traits, we assess the fish sensitivity to fishing, at the species and community level. We show that climate warming promotes a borealization of fish assemblages in the northeast, associated with slower life histories in that area. The biology of Arctic species is still poorly known, and boreal species that now establish in the Arctic are fishery sensitive, which calls for cautious ecosystem management of these areas.","Wiedmann, M.A.; Primicerio, R.; Dolgov, A.; Ottesen, C.A.M.; Aschan, M.",WOS:000342846600009,"Wiedmann, Magnus, M.A.","Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.1203,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Areal management; Barents Sea; biogeography; climate change; fast–slow continuum; fisheries; phylogeny,Journal article,,,"Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",Norway,Areal management; Barents Sea; biogeography; climate change; fast-slow continuum; fisheries; phylogeny,COD GADUS-MORHUA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTINCTION RISK; MARINE FISHES; VULNERABILITY; EVOLUTION; COLLAPSE; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; COMMUNITY,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,University of Tromsø,,Norway,,University,Science

Collected organisms that die or are rejected before a point of sale often go unreported. For the global marine aquarium trade, identifying the loss of collected fish from rejection, prior to export, is a first step in assessing true collection levels. This study takes a detailed look at fish rejections by buyers before export using the Papua New Guinea marine aquarium fishery as a case study. Utilizing collection invoices detailing the species and quantity of fish (Actinopteri and Elasmobranchii) accepted or rejected by the exporting company it was determined that, over a six month period, 24.2% of the total fish catch reported (n = 13,886) was rejected. Of the ten most collected fish families, rejection frequency was highest for the Apogonidae (54.2%), Chaetodontidae (26.3%), and Acanthuridae (18.2%) and lowest for Labridae (6.6%) and Hemiscylliidae (0.7%). The most frequently cited reasons for rejection were fin damage (45.6% of cases), undersized fish (21.8%), and fish deemed too thin (11.1%). Despite fishers receiving feedback on invoices explaining rejections, there was no improvement in rejection frequencies over time (r = -0.33, P = 0.15) with weekly rejection frequencies being highly inconsistent (range: 2.8% to 79.4%; s = 16.3%). These findings suggest that export/import statistics can greatly underestimate collection for the marine aquarium trade as additional factors such as fisher discards, escapees, post-collection mortalities, and unregulated domestic trade would further contribute to this disparity.","Militz, T.A.; Kinch, J.; Foale, S.; Southgate, P.C.",WOS:000371993000165,"Militz, Thane, T.A.","James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0151624,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Australia.",Australia,,HOME-RANGE; REEF FISH; MORTALITY; IMPACT; HOST; SIZE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,James Cook University,,Australia,,University,Science

Due to their close phylogenetic relationship with seep species and tiny mussels from organic substrates, it was hypothesized that they gradually evolved from shallow to deeper environments, and specialized in decaying organic remains, then in seeps, and finally colonized deep-sea vents. Here, we present a multigene phylogeny that reveals that most of the genera are polyphyletic and/or paraphyletic. The robustness of the phylogeny allows us to revise the genus-level classification. Organic remains are robustly supported as the ancestral habitat for Bathymodiolinae. However, rather than a single step toward colonization of vents and seeps, recurrent habitat shifts from organic substrates to vents and seeps occurred during evolution, and never the reverse. This new phylogenetic framework challenges the gradualist scenarios “from shallow to deep.” Mussels from organic remains tolerate a large range of ecological conditions and display a spectacular species diversity contrary to vent mussels, although such habitats are yet underexplored compared to vents and seeps. Overall, our data suggest that for deep-sea mussels, the high specialization to vent habitats provides ecological success in this harsh habitat but also brings the lineage to a kind of evolutionary dead end.","Thubaut, J.; Puillandre, N.; Faure, B.; Cruaud, C.; Samadi, S.",WOS:000327304000012,"Thubaut, Justine, J.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, Unite Mixte Rech UPMC IRD MNHN CNRS 7138, Dept Systemat & Evolut, F-75005 Paris, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.749,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bathymodiolinae,,,Bathymodiolinae; chemosynthetic ecosystem; deep-sea; evolution,Journal article,,,"Museum Natl Hist Nat, Unite Mixte Rech UPMC IRD MNHN CNRS 7138, Dept Systemat & Evolut, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,Bathymodiolinae; chemosynthetic ecosystem; deep-sea; evolution,HYDROTHERMAL VENT MUSSELS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; SPECIES RICHNESS; WOODEN STEPS; MYTILIDAE; SEEP; SYMBIONTS; AZORICUS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,"Joint Research Unit: Systematics, Adaptation and Evolution (SAE) (UMR 7138)",,France,,Research network,Science

This species was recently demonstrated to be genetically distinct from its southern congener, <i>O. conchaphila</i> Carpenter, 1857, but our new sampling, combined with previously published data, supports a tentative allopatric pattern, with the southern and northern species restricted to either side of Punta Eugenia in Baja California, Mexico, a known biogeographic boundary. We collected <i>O. conchaphila</i> and multiple co-occurring oyster species at 11 sites along the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur or within the Gulf of California, Mexico. Oyster surveys revealed at least six other co-occurring species, including two exotics, of Ostreidae Rafinesque, 1815 that were identified by sequencing 16S ribosomal DNA (16S) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial markers. In addition to our newly collected material, our phylogenetic analyses included Ostreidae from worldwide localities available in GenBank. Phylogenetic estimates, using maximum likelihood, supported the sister species relationship between <i>Ostrea lurida</i> Carpenter, 1864 and <i>O. conchaphila</i> Carpenter, 1857. Together, they group as the sister lineage of <i>Myrakeena angelica</i> (Rochebrune, 1895), nested within a grouping of species currently assigned to <i>Ostrea</i> Linnaeus, 1758. Thus, we have revived the original name Ostrea angelica Rochebrune, 1895 and consider the monotypic genus, <i>Myrakeena</i> Harry, 1985 a junior synonym of Ostrea. We also collected <i>O. equestris</i> Say, 1834, native to the Caribbean and not previously reported in the Eastern Pacific.

Another subfamily, Lophinae Vialov, 1936, is best synonymized with Ostreinae because it would otherwise be paraphyletic to that taxon.

Biotic indices are widely used in studies to help understanding these relationships and to assess the environmental status of waters. In recent years, trait-based indices rapidly emerged as an alternative ‘functional’ approach to serve this purpose. In this study, we analysed how two indices based upon the mean (community-weighted mean trait value–CWM) and the diversity of multiple traits (Rao’s quadratic entropy–Rao) in a macroinvertebrate community respond to natural- and anthropogenic seafloor disturbance (effluents) and we compared their performance with the widely used AMBI and M-AMBI. Our results demonstrate that CWM and Rao were not effective in indicating anthropogenic disturbance in the Basque coast, Bay of Biscay. The main reason was probably that many traits did not have a strong link with this type of disturbance. Besides, the mechanistic links between certain traits and their response to anthropogenic seafloor disturbance in marine environments is currently not well understood. From a management perspective: the CWM does not provide a single value indicating a quality status, which makes it a difficult tool to use and interpret. This index is probably more useful for scientists who want to explore and understand different aspects of community functioning. On the other hand, Rao and other indices expressing trait diversity do provide a single value of functioning; therefore they could potentially be effectively used for management purposes. However, to improve its performance, detailed and accurate trait data is required, which is currently lacking for many marine species.","van der Linden, P.; Borja, A.; Rodríquez, J.G.; Muxika, I.; Galparsoro, I.; Patrício, J.; Veríssimo, H.; Marques, J.C.",WOS:000388785100061,"van der Linden, Pieter, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.020,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Ecosystem functioning, Impact assessment, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Macroinvertebrates, Biodiversity, Ecological indicators",Journal article,,,"Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Fac Sci & Technol, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal.",Portugal,Ecosystem functioning; Impact assessment; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Macroinvertebrates; Biodiversity; Ecological indicators,MARINE BIOTIC INDEX; SOFT-BOTTOM BENTHOS; BOHAI BAY CHINA; SPECIES TRAITS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; M-AMBI; PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY; HUMAN PRESSURES,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Coimbra - Faculty of Sciences & Technology - MARE (Marine and Environmental Science Centre),x,Portugal,,Research institute,Science

In previous papers, faunistic and preliminary taxonomic data on marine and freshwater gastrotrichs found in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, were reported. Here two new interesting marine macrodasyidan species in the families Dactylopodolidae and Thaumastodermatidae are described based on observations carried out on living specimens and using differential interference contrast microscopy. The two novel species are named in honor of two great South African icons recently deceased: Nadine Gordimer and Nelson Mandela. <i>Dactylopodola Nadine</i> sp. n. is the third species in the genus to bear red eye-spots; it can easily be distinguished from the closely-related red-eyed <i>D. baltica</i> and <i>D. roscovita</i> by its smaller size (Total length = 230 μm vs 275 μm vs 450 μm, respectively) and the lower number of adhesive tubes of the anterior, lateral and posterior series (on each side: 3, 4 and 4 vs 5, 6 and 8 vs 2, 9 and 12–15). <i>Pseudostomella mandela</i> sp. n. is a fairly large species (up to 481 μm in length), with a cuticular covering made up of tetrancres and relatively long caudal pedicles (up to 44 μm in length ). The most evident autoapomorphic trait of the new species is the presence of 7 pairs of ‘cirrata’ tubes, two emerging in a lateral position along the pharyngeal region and five from the dorsolateral sides of the trunk. Additional relevant taxonomic characters include: 4 tubes of the anterior series, 11 tubes of the ventrolateral series and 3 tubes of the posterior series per side, 5 papillae on the dorsal margin and 6 papillae on the ventral margin of the oral palps. The high number of putative new species discovered among the South African gastrotrich fauna during our relatively short survey, highlights the relevance of this region with regard to the diversity of this group and stresses once again the importance of investigating new geographic areas in order to improve our understanding of global gastrotrich biodiversity and species richness.","Todaro, M.A.; Perissinotto, R.; Bownes, S.J.",WOS:000347979900002,"Todaro, M.

A large multidisciplinary programme investigated the sources and relative influences of nutrients on the shelf. Within this, and to address a critical knowledge gap, this study describes macrobenthic (<1 mm) composition and frequency from 16 stations, assigned amongst four oceanographic focus areas. The areas were predetermined across the disciplines to represent upwelling, outwelling and a semi-persistent eddy, with nutrients and primary productivity being measured at each. Environmental variables such as sediment distribution, sediment TOC and bottom water physico-chemistry were determined at a significantly larger spatial scale. Our study postulated that oceanographic focus areas support significantly different macrobenthic assemblages, and that composition and relative distribution is due to measurable habitat attributes at each. Macrofauna were relatively abundant and particularly rich at >1 000 taxa. Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Sipuncula and Cnidaria (>50 taxa each) were the dominant macrobenthic groups in the bight. Annelida were dominated by the polychaete families Spionidae, Terrebelidae and Cirratullidae, which were generally associated with outwelling and a mud depocentre off the Thukela River. Two unique and distinctive assemblages were found, one in the Thukela Mouth focus area and another on the midshelf between Thukela and Durban. The latter is influenced by poorly sorted, coarse sand and with probable influences from the Durban Eddy. There assemblages were abundant, rich and specific to this habitat. Correlation, PERMANOVA and CAP analyses showed assemblage fidelity to the focus areas.

However, little is known about the effects of crude oil spills on these important components of planktonic communities. We determined the effects of Louisiana light sweet crude oil exposure on survival and bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in adult stages of the scyphozoans <i>Pelagia noctiluca</i> and <i>Aurelia aurita</i> and the ctenophore <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>, and on survival of ephyra larvae of <i>A. aurita</i> and cydippid larvae of <i>M. leidyi</i>, in the laboratory. Adult <i>P. noctiluca</i> showed 100% mortality at oil concentration ≥20 µL L<sup>−1</sup> after 16 h. In contrast, low or non-lethal effects were observed on adult stages of <i>A. aurita</i> and <i>M. leidyi</i> exposed at oil concentration ≤25 µL L<sup>−1</sup> after 6 days. Survival of ephyra and cydippid larva decreased with increasing crude oil concentration and exposition time. The median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) for ephyra larvae ranged from 14.41 to 0.15 µL L<sup>−1</sup> after 1 and 3 days, respectively.

A total of 2544 specimens were identified corresponding to 169 taxa, mostly bivalves (62% of the total taxa). <i>Abra alba</i> was the most abundant and the most frequent species. The <i>alpha</i> diversity ranged from one species to 21 spp. 0.1 m− 2. The highest abundance and diversity were obtained in coarser sediments. Multivariate analysis based on the abundance data identified five major malacological groups: (a) <i>Angulus pygmaeus</i> and <i>Thracia villosiuscula</i> in the coarser sediments of the western inner and mid shelf; (b) <i>Calyptraea chinensis</i> and <i>Leptochiton cancellatus</i> in the heterogeneous and organically enriched sediments of the southern shelf; (c) <i>Angulus fabula, Spisula subtruncata</i> and <i>Pharus legume</i> in the near shore exposed fine sands; (d) <i>A. alba</i> in muddy fine sands, mainly in the northwestern shelf and (e) <i>Saccella commutate</i> in the southwestern deeper shelf. The malacofauna could be used as a proxy for the major benthic communities known to occur in this area, except in muddy patches, where molluscs were absent or low abundant. Median grain-size, gravel content, depth and hydrodynamic regime were the environmental factors best related to the malacofauna spatial distribution patterns.

We present an updated stratigraphy and revise the taxonomic determinations for important historical collections from Indonesia that have been the basis of our knowledge of the history of the region for the past 150 years. Revision of the stratigraphy increases the resolution of ages assigned to most of the collections, and shifts a significant number of coral occurrences from the Pliocene to the late Miocene revealing a new Pliocene sampling gap. The previously recognized Paleogene sampling gap remains open. Analysis of taxonomic turnover with unrevised and revised data show similar overall patterns, with an early Miocene increase in richness followed by a plateau of relatively high richness. Overall, the observed pattern of taxonomic turnover is highly correlated with sample size, suggesting that uneven sampling may be a more important control on the data pattern than processes of speciation and extinction. Highly correlated turnover patterns of zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate taxa are also consistent with this interpretation. The paucity of Paleogene data in the historical collections means that the prevailing paradigm of Neogene origins of high richness in the modern Coral Triangle remains a tautological default hypothesis. New collections are required to adequately estimate rates of taxonomic turnover in the region, and to reconstruct the structure and functioning of ancient ecosystems during the origins of the Coral Triangle biodiversity hotspot.

These deposits and faunas have not been studied in the same detail as contemporaneous features in northwest and southernmost Africa. We analyzed the fossil assemblages and sedimentology of two closely spaced middle Pleistocene marine terrace deposits in Baía das Pipas, southwest Angola. This revealed 46 gastropod and 29 bivalve species, along with scleractinian corals, encrusting bryozoans, polychaete tubes, barnacles, and echinoids. The fauna is characteristic of intertidal and nearshore rocky substrates and sandy soft-bottom habitats. Sedimentological analysis is consistent with faunal data and indicates an upper shoreface paleoenvironment along a gravel coast. This diverse fauna stands out as a rare example of a marine Pleistocene assemblage from over 6,000 km of the West African coast. The assemblage is dominated by extant tropical West African molluscs, including species from the “Senegalese fauna” that colonized northern Africa and beyond during Pleistocene interstadials. Additionally, as along the modern coast of the Namibe Desert, the influence of the cool-water Benguela Current is apparent in the paleofauna by the occurrence of a few temperate species. The distribution and thermal tolerances of extant species identified in the Pipas fauna indicate that this region experienced similar climatic and oceanographic conditions as that of the present during this interstadial. Seasonal temperature varied between ∼20 and 28°C and resulted from upwelling in this tropical setting.","Sessa, J.A.; Callapez, P.M.; Dinis, P.A.; Hendy, A.J.W.",WOS:000327359000005,"Sessa, Jocelyn, J.A.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1666/12-119,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleontol, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",USA,,CURRENT UPWELLING SYSTEM; SEA-LEVEL CHANGES; BENGUELA CURRENT; CORAL-REEFS; VERTICAL MOVEMENTS; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; STROMBUS-BUBONIUS; LITTORAL DEPOSITS; QUATERNARY; GASTROPODA,Paleontology,Paleontology,Smithsonian Institution - Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History - Department of Paleobiology,,USA,,Museum,Science

The occurrence of abundant supplementary BR often diversifies trophic niches within food webs. Blooms of opportunistic macroalgae, which may act as additional BRs, have increased in intensity, and are expected to amplify further because of global change. Understanding the effects of high biomasses of opportunistic BRs on the functioning of naturally unvegetated coastal ecosystems is thus crucial. We set out to assess whether and how green algae (opportunistic BR) modifies macrotidal sandy beach trophic structure and functioning. We also investigated whether these effects propagate up through the web, looking at different scales and trophic levels (<i>i.e</i>. primary producers, specific primary consumers, and the general higher-consumer assemblage). To achieve these objectives, we used a high-resolution field sampling (over 1200 individual stable isotope-, and 180 biodiversity samples) at pristine and macroalgal-bloom-affected macrotidal sandy beaches, together with recent and novel analytical approaches (biomass-weighted isotope signatures, Isotopic Functional Indices). We found that the opportunistic BR, both directly and indirectly affects the entire beach food web across several trophic levels, by inducing shifts in trophic interactions. Overall, we found that the dominance of a BR in the form of opportunistic algae simplifies the entire food web over time. Our findings challenge the paradigm that addition of BR inherently diversifies trophic interactions within an ecosystem, and have implications for the interpretation of shifts in dynamic system food webs and eutrophicated environments.","Quillien, N.; Nordström, M.C.; Schaal, G.; Bonsdorff, E.; Grall, J.",WOS:000371950600012,"Nordström, Marie, M.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.01.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Ulva,,,"Trophic web, Macrotidal sandy beach, Ulva, Zoobenthos, Isotopic, metrics",Journal article,,,"Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Inst Univ Europe Mer, CNRS, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR,UMR 6539, Plouzane, France.",France,Trophic web; Macrotidal sandy beach; Ulva; Zoobenthos; Isotopic metrics,SANDY BEACH ECOSYSTEMS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NICHE WIDTH; ALGAE; DELTA-C-13; COMMUNITY; NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; ACCUMULATION; BIODIVERSITY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Joint Research Unit: Laboratoire des sciences de l'environnement marine (LEMAR) (UMR 6539),x,France,,Research network,Science

The contribution of species traits to presence beyond reefs was then quantified using a binomial generalized linear mixed effects model. In each region, coral species richness dropped by up to 73% where reef accretion ceased. Compared with corals restricted to coral reefs, the subset of species extending beyond reefs shared common traits related to environmental tolerance (larger depth ranges, more robust morphologies and tolerance of turbid water), but not to dispersal potential. Patterns were mostly consistent among regions. We show for the first time that coral species living successfully in beyond-reef habitats share common characteristics that are consistent in three global regions.

We addressed this issue in the Brachycladiidae, a cosmopolitan digenean family specific to marine mammals. We used, for the first time, distance-based and event-based methods to explicitly test the coevolutionary events that have shaped the current brachycladiid-marine mammal associations. Parasite phylogeny was constructed using mtDNA ND3 sequences of nine brachycladiid species, and host phylogeny using cytochrome <i>b</i> sequences of 104 mammalian species. A total of 50 host-parasite links were identified. Distance-based methods supported the hypothesis of a global non-random association of host and parasite phylogenies. Significant individual links (i.e., 24 out of 50) were those related to <i>Campula oblonga, Nasitrema delphini, N. globicephalae</i> and <i>Brachycladium atlanticum</i> and their associated taxa from the Delphinoidea. Regarding event-based methods, we explored 54 schemes using different combinations of costs for each potential coevolutionary event.

233,288066,2016,AS,Ammonium excretion and oxygen respiration of tropical copepods and euphausiids exposed to oxygen minimum zone conditions,"<b>Kiko, R.; Hauss, H.; Buchholz, F.; Melzner, F.</b> (2016). Ammonium excretion and oxygen respiration of tropical copepods and euphausiids exposed to oxygen minimum zone conditions. <i>Biogeosciences 13(8)</i>: 2241-2255. <a href=""https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-13-2241-2016"" target=""_blank"">https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-13-2241-2016</a>","Calanoid copepods and euphausiids are key components of marine zooplankton communities worldwide. Most euphausiids and several copepod species perform diel vertical migrations (DVMs) that contribute to the export of particulate and dissolved matter to midwater depths. In vast areas of the global ocean, and in particular in the eastern tropical Atlantic and Pacific, the daytime distribution depth of many migrating organisms corresponds to the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). At depth, the animals experience reduced temperature and oxygen partial pressure (<i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>) and an increased carbon dioxide partial pressure (<i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) compared to their near-surface nighttime habitat. Although it is well known that low oxygen levels can inhibit respiratory activity, the respiration response of tropical copepods and euphausiids to relevant <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, and temperature conditions remains poorly parameterized. Further, the regulation of ammonium excretion at OMZ conditions is generally not well understood. It was recently estimated that DVM-mediated ammonium supply could fuel bacterial anaerobic ammonium oxidation – a major loss process for fixed nitrogen in the ocean considerably. These estimates were based on the implicit assumption that hypoxia or anoxia in combination with hypercapnia (elevated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) does not result in a down-regulation of ammonium excretion. We exposed calanoid copepods from the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA; <i>Undinula vulgaris</i> and <i>Pleuromamma abdominalis</i>) and euphausiids from the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP; <i>Euphausia mucronata</i>) and the ETNA (<i>Euphausia gibboides</i>) to different temperatures, carbon dioxide and oxygen levels to study their survival, respiration and excretion rates at these conditions. An increase in temperature by 10 °C led to an approximately 2-fold increase of the respiration and excretion rates of <i>U. vulgaris</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>10, respiration</sub> = 1.4; <i>Q</i><sub>10, NH<sub>4</sub>-excretion</sub> = 1.6), <i>P. abdominalis</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>10, respiration</sub> = 2.0; <i>Q</i><sub>10, NH<sub>4</sub>-excretion</sub> = 2.4) and <i>E. gibboides</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>10, respiration</sub> = 2.0; <i>Q</i><sub>10, NH<sub>4</sub>-excretion</sub> = 2.4; <i>E. mucronata</i> not tested). Exposure to differing carbon dioxide levels had no overall significant impact on the respiration or excretion rates. Species from the ETNA were less tolerant to low oxygen levels than <i>E. mucronata</i> from the ETSP, which survived exposure to anoxia at 13 °C. Respiration and excretion rates were reduced upon exposure to low oxygen levels, albeit at different species-specific levels. Reduction of the excretion and respiration rates in ETNA species occurred at a <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> of 0.6 (<i>P. abdominalis</i>) and 2.4 kPa (<i>U. vulgaris</i> and <i>E. gibboides</i>) at OMZ temperatures. Such low oxygen levels are normally not encountered by these species in the ETNA. <i>E. mucronata</i> however regularly migrates into the strongly hypoxic to anoxic core of the ETSP OMZ. Exposure to low oxygen levels led to a strong reduction of respiration and ammonium excretion in <i>E. mucronata</i> (<i>p</i><sub>crit  respiration</sub> = 0.6, <i>p</i><sub>crit NH<sub>4</sub>-excretion</sub> = 0.73). A drastic reduction of respiratory activity was also observed by other authors for euphausiids, squat lobsters and calanoid copepods, but was not yet accounted for when calculating DVM-mediated active fluxes into the ETSP OMZ. Current estimates of DVM-mediated active export of carbon and nitrogen into the ETSP OMZ are therefore likely too high and future efforts to calculate these export rates should take the physiological responses of migratory species to OMZ conditions into account.","Kiko, R.; Hauss, H.; Buchholz, F.; Melzner, F.",WOS:000377276700002,"Kiko, Rainer, R.","GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-13-2241-2016,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Wischhofstr 1-3, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",Germany,,ZOOPLANKTON VERTICAL MIGRATION; METABOLIC SUPPRESSION; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; UPWELLING SYSTEM; ACTIVE-TRANSPORT; MARINE; CARBON; RATES; PACIFIC; HYPOXIA,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel,,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Here we analyze its patterns of species richness, origination, and extinction over the past 12 My in the southwestern caribbean (SWC). Taxic analysis of a database comprising 3344 specimens and 114 species shows species richness and sampling intensity to co-vary over this interval. Richness is lowest in the late miocene (pre-NN11), then rises and remains approximately constant until the recent, when it rises sharply. No large peaks in fossil origination rates occur, though extinction rates may increase between 2 and 1 ma. Well-sampled extinct species had median durations of 0.8–1.75 My, but the large majority of species are rare, confined to one or a few horizons, and have durations of <1 My.  <i>Polystira</i> shows the highest species origination rates recorded among marine gastropods (0.585–0.935 My<sup>-1</sup>), combined with short species durations; 94% of living species evolved within the past 1.6 My. This contrasts with longer durations and slower speciation rates in the hyperdiverse conoidean Conus, but that pattern requires restudy. High post-isthmian diversity—coinciding with increased habitat heterogeneity—contrasts with the massive decline in SWC species richness in another carnivorous gastropod—the “strombinid” columbellidae. We suggest that diversification of <i>Polystira</i> has been driven by intrinsic feeding-related specialization, whereas regionally the near-extinction of scavenging, non-specialized “strombinids” is a direct response to an extrinsic decline in seasonality and variation in food supply that supports trophic generalism.","Todd, J.A.; Johnson, K.G.",WOS:000326555900008,"Todd, Jonathan, J.A.","Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.5343/bms.2012.1083,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",England,,EVOLUTIONARY RADIATIONS; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; FAUNAL TURNOVER; COSTA-RICA; CONUS; EXTINCTION; PANAMA; GENUS; PEPTIDES; NEOGENE,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Natural History Museum (NHM),,,,,

The oceanographic features of the two zones are markedly different, with influence of the Humboldt Current in the north, and the Cape Horn Current System, together with freshwater influxes, in the Magellanic zone. Both regions were surveyed twice during 2013 by SCUBA diving and pulling ropes and aquaculture cages. Both artificial structures and natural communities were sampled. A total of 22 species were identified, three of them reported for the first time in Chilean waters: <i>Lissoclinum perforatum, Synoicum georgianum</i>, and <i>Polyzoa minor</i>. The first is an introduced species found here for the first time in the Pacific. No species occurred in both regions, highlighting the very different environmental conditions of subantarctic vs. temperate waters. In spite of exhaustive searches in aquaculture facilities and on artificial structures such as harbour docks and piers, no introduced species were found in the Punta Arenas area. Conversely, 5 out of 11 (45%) species found in northern Chile were introduced. The Coquimbo area has a history of ship traffic dating back at least 150 years, and cultures of native (e.g. scallop) as well as exotic species (e.g. abalone) have been deployed for ca. 35 years. Some of the introduced species, such as <i>Ciona robusta</i> (formerly <i>C. intestinalis</i> sp. A), constitute pests for scallop culture facilities in the area, causing serious losses to local farmers. It is surprising that the Punta Arenas zone, with a history of ship traffic dating back ca. 500 years and over 25 years of sustained mussel and salmon aquaculture activity, is apparently free from introduced species. The ascidian cover on artificial structures is high, but it is made up of native species such as <i>Paramolgula</i> sp., <i>Cnemidocarpa verrucosa</i>, or <i>Polyzoa opuntia</i>. It is hypothesized that cold waters (5 to 11ºC) are the determining factor hindering the development of introduced ascidians, which tend to be temperate-warm water species. The ongoing warming in the Southern Cone may change this picture and continued monitoring is strongly advised.","Turon, X.; Cañete, J.I.; Sellanes, J.; Rocha, R.M.; López-Legentil, S.",WOS:000422636100010,"Cañete, Juan, J.I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3391/mbi.2016.7.1.10,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,tunicates; ship traffic; exotic species; bivalve cultures; Strait ofMagellan; Coquimbo,Journal article,,,"Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, Acces Cala S Francesc 14, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain.",Spain,tunicates; ship traffic; exotic species; bivalve cultures; Strait of Magellan; Coquimbo,,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,CSIC - Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

While this remarkable achievement in terms of volume of data must be acknowledged, concerns about the quality and ‘fitness-for-use’ of the data should also be carefully considered in future developments. This contribution is therefore a direct response to the calls for comprehensive content assessment of the GBIF mobilised data. It is the first comprehensive assessment of the coverage of the content mobilised so far through GBIF, as well as a mean to identify the existing gaps and reflect on fitness-for-use requirements. This paper describes the complementary methodologies adopted by the GBIF Secretariat and University of Navarra for the development of a comprehensive content assessment. Outcomes of these research initiatives are summarised in four categories, namely, (a) data quality assessment, (b) trends/patterns assessment, (c) fitness-for-use assessment, and (d) ecosystem specific data diversity assessment. In conclusion we make specific suggestions to the GBIF community on the adoption of common indicators to assess progress towards future targets as well as recommendations to populate such exercise at various levels within the GBIF Network from national level to thematic levels.","Samy, G.; Chavan, V.; Ariño, A.H.; Otegui, J.; Hobern, D.; Sood, R.; Robles, E.",,"Chavan, Vishwas, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.17161/bi.v8i2.4124,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Primary Biodiversity Data, Content Assessment, Gap Analysis",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to test the reliability of the molecular data currently available on the small alien oysters recently invading the Mediterranean Sea. Samples from Greece and Turkey, encompassing the known species-specific morphological variation, were sequenced for the markers with the widest taxonomic coverage in the group of small oysters (i.e. the 16S rDNA and the COI). The sequences obtained have been compared with those available in GenBank, and a possible identification at the species level has been finally tested in a DNA-barcoding fashion. The present results clearly demonstrated that our samples belong to a single, morphologically highly variable species. Their 16S sequences were closely related to a sequence registered under the name <i>Dendostrea folium</i>, with a genetic distance which does not warrant conspecificity. Additionally, a remarkable number of sequences retrieved from the GenBank (of both genes) did not form a monophyletic group according to the published classification of the vouchers, suggesting—at least in part—an origin from specimens not properly identified. Both genes seem promising for use as DNA-barcode, although the COI will probably prove more effective. Therefore, we urge the availability of a baseline of oyster pedigreed DNA barcode sequences in the public databases, to allow the use of such genetic data to reliably monitor bio-invasions in the Mediterranean Sea.","Crocetta, F.; Mariottini, P.; Salvi, D.; Oliverio, M.",WOS:000348037500012,"Crocetta, F.","Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315414001027,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Mollusca, ""Ostreidae""",,,"DNA-barcoding, Mollusca, oysters, alien species, Mediterranean",Journal article,,,"Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol & Biotecnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",Italy,DNA-barcoding; Mollusca; oysters; alien species; Mediterranean,CRASSOSTREA-ANGULATA; SEQUENCE-STRUCTURE; HONG-KONG; MITOCHONDRIAL; BIVALVIA; MOLLUSCA; PHYLOGENY; OSTREIDAE; FRAMEWORK; CLASSIFICATION,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli (SZN),,Italy,,Research institute,Science

A review of carbonate mineralogy in marine sponges (75 specimens, 32 species), along with new data from New Zealand (42 specimens in 15 species) allows us to investigate patterns and make predictions. In general sponges show little variability within individuals and within species (± 0.5 wt.% MgCO<sub>3</sub> in calcite). Extant sponges in Class Calcarea generally produce calcitic spicules with relatively high Mg contents, up to 15 wt.% MgCO<sub>3</sub>.

There is generally a weak phylogenetic consistency among classes, orders and families. Statistical analyses, including those accounting for these phylogenetic effects, fail to find a substantial or significant effect of water temperature on mineralogical variation.

Rather, in the case herein described, <i>C. lampas</i> held and manipulated its prey with the foot and used its taenioglossan radula located at the end of the extendible pleurembolic proboscis to scrape and ingest the soft tissues of the sea star and, subsequently, consume the remaining skeletal components again using the proboscis and contained radula. These two phases of consumption were followed by two matching phases of faeces production.

The adverse effects of human trampling have recently received increasing attention from conservation biologists, especially when concerning species playing key functional roles. These include biogenic reefs providing extremely productive and diverse habitats due to their structural heterogeneity and three-dimensional complexity. The degradation of such habitats could not only adversely affect the whole coastal biota, but it could also have strong socio-economic implications. This study investigated the potential impact of human trampling on biogenic reefs built by the honeycomb worm <i>Sabellaria alveolata</i> in north-western Portugal. Three increasing intensities of human trampling were manipulated to test for their direct effects on <i>S. alveolata</i> bio-constructions and indirect effects on associated benthic infauna. Experimental trampling, even at low intensity, negatively affected reefs by reducing the percentage cover of intact <i>S. alveolata</i> concretions over a period of two months, but it did not alter the structure of whole assemblages compared to the unmanipulated condition. Idiosyncratic responses were shown by the most conspicuous taxa, ranging from no significant effects on <i>S. alveolata</i> and Amphipoda to spatially and temporally variable effects on the Syllidae and Sabellidae polychaetes, the Mytilidae bivalves and the Rissoidae gastropods. When present, however, differences were always in the direction of larger abundances under the highest intensity of trampling than in the less disturbed treatments and the unmanipulated control. This study provides one of the first experimental evidence linking the intensity of human trampling to the physical damage of <i>S. alveolata</i> reefs. Direct implications of present findings as tools to promote a sustainable use of these systems at a local scale and to stimulate protection and management initiatives at other locations are discussed.","Plicanti, A.; Domínguez, R.; Dubois, S.F.; Bertocci, I.",WOS:000374200200005,"Domínguez, Rula, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.02.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Sabellaria alveolata,,,"Biodiversity, Biogenic reefs, Sabellaria alveolata, Anthropogenic disturbance, Trampling, Rocky intertidal",Journal article,,,"Univ Salerno, Lab Zool & Biol Marina, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Biol Ambientali, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",Italy,Biodiversity; Biogenic reefs; Sabellaria alveolata; Anthropogenic disturbance; Trampling; Rocky intertidal,MONT-SAINT-MICHEL; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; ROCKY INTERTIDAL COMMUNITY; ASINARA ISLAND MPA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; LARVAL DISPERSAL; TAXONOMIC LEVELS; POLYCHAETA; SETTLEMENT,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Salerno - Department of Environmental Biological Science and Technology - Laboratory of Marine Zoology and Biology,x,Italy,,Research institute,Science

We tested the proposition that marine species richness patterns of rare and common species differ, both within a taxon in their contribution to the richness pattern of the full assemblage and among taxa in the strength of their correlations with each other. We used high-resolution marine datasets for UK intertidal macroalgae, molluscs and crustaceans each with more than 400 species. We estimated the relative contribution of rare and common species, treating rarity and commonness as a continuous spectrum, to spatial patterns in richness using spatial cross-correlations. Correlation strength and significance was estimated both within and between taxa. Common species drove richness patterns within taxa, but rare species contributed more when species were placed on an equal footing via scaling by binomial variance. Between taxa, relatively small sub-assemblages (fewer than 60 species) of common species produced the maximum correlation with each other, regardless of taxon pairing. Cross-correlations between rare species were generally weak, with maximum correlation occurring between small sub-assemblages in only one case. Cross-correlations between common and rare species of different taxa were consistently weak or absent. Common species in the three marine assemblages were congruent in their richness patterns, but rare species were generally not. The contrast between the stronger correlations among common species and the weak or absent correlations among rare species indicates a decoupling of the processes driving common and rare species richness patterns. The internal structure of richness patterns of these marine taxa is similar to that observed for terrestrial taxa.","Reddin, C.J.; Bothwell, J.H.; Lennon, J.J.",WOS:000367668000011,"Reddin, C.J.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12372,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Indicator; intertidal ecology; marine; rarity; spatial; species richness; surrogacy,Journal article,,,"Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",North Ireland,Indicator; intertidal ecology; marine; rarity; spatial; species richness; surrogacy,GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; MARINE; RARITY; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; SYSTEMS; SCALES; TESTS,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Queen's University of Belfast (QUB),,UK,,University,Science

The research was performed in the Parila lagoon in Croatia; an important nursery ground where conditions in epibenthic community can have significant direct and indirect impact on fisheries. Diversity (30 species) and abundance (from 0 to 7 ind m<sup>−2</sup>) of epibenthic assemblages was low on all stations and showed remarkable seasonal changes. Such patchiness could support the estuarine quality paradox idea, i.e. the most abundant species are well adapted to changing conditions in a variable environment. The ecological analysis showed that total phosphorus concentration (TP), temperature (T) and salinity (S) were the main environmental parameters affecting community structure of the Parila lagoon. Six species listed as frequent (<i>Nerophis ophidion</i>, <i>Zosterisessor ophiocephalus</i>, <i>Syngnathus typhle</i>, <i>Cerastoderma glaucum</i>, <i>Palaemon adspersus</i> and <i>Carcinus aestuarii</i>) have a potential to be used as indicators of habitat quality. In terms of trophic diversity, community was dominated by carnivores and omnivores. Fish trophic index (above 2.7) indicated upward shift of the local food chain and towards mostly carnivorous species, while the absence of herbivorous species pointed to low environmental quality. The present study gives an insight into the current ecological conditions in the Parila lagoon. Further research about the sensitivity of these potential indicators to different types of pressure is necessary in order to select robust early-warning indicators framework.","Prusina, I.; Dobroslavic, T.; Glamuzina, L.; Conides, A.; Bogner, D.; Matijevic, S.; Glamuzina, B.",WOS:000416870600008,"Prusina, Ivana, I.","Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Aquaculture, Cira Carica 4, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11852-017-0540-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Coastal lagoon Epibenthic community Epibenthic predation Trophic guilds Indicators Ecological quality ,Journal article,,,"Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Aquaculture, Cira Carica 4, Dubrovnik 20000, Croatia.",Croatia,Coastal lagoon; Epibenthic community; Epibenthic predation; Trophic guilds; Indicators; Ecological quality,MACROBENTHIC PROCESS-INDICATORS; EASTERN ADRIATIC SEA; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; COASTAL LAGOON; ORGANIC ENRICHMENT; BIOTIC INDEXES; ESTUARINE; PRESSURE; MACROINVERTEBRATES; VARIABILITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,University of Dubrovnik,,Croatia,,University,Science

Technical advances and increased availability of genetic information have fueled the discovery of molecules responsible for stem cell pluripotency and regeneration in flatworms. Unfortunately, most of the planarian research performed worldwide utilizes species that are not natural habitants of North America, which limits their availability to newcomer laboratories and impedes their distribution for educational activities. In order to circumvent these limitations and increase the genetic information available for comparative studies, we sequenced the transcriptome of <i>Girardia dorotocephala</i>, a planarian species pandemic and commercially available in North America. A total of 254,802,670 paired sequence reads were obtained from RNA extracted from intact individuals, regenerating fragments, as well as freshly excised auricles of a clonal line of <i>G. dorotocephala</i> (MA-C2), and used for de novo assembly of its transcriptome. The resulting transcriptome draft was validated through functional analysis of genetic markers of stem cells and their progeny in <i>G. dorotocephala</i>. Akin to orthologs in other planarian species, <i>G. dorotocephala</i> <i>Piwi1 (GdPiwi1)</i> was found to be a robust marker of the planarian stem cell population and <i>GdPiwi2</i> an essential component for stem cell-driven regeneration. Identification of <i>G. dorotocephala</i> homologs of the early stem cell descendent marker PROG-1 revealed a family of lysine-rich proteins expressed during epithelial cell differentiation. Sequences from the MA-C2 transcriptome were found to be 98–99% identical to nucleotide sequences from <i>G. dorotocephala</i> populations with different chromosomal number, demonstrating strong conservation regardless of karyotype evolution.

This southernmost part of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is a typical high-latitude Antarctic region located in the circumpolar permanent pack-ice zone. It became accessible for large-scale scientific surveys only through the availability of modern ice-breaking research vessels, such as the German RV “Polarstern”. Here, we describe a dataset of the faunal composition and abundance of starfish, brittle star and sea cucumber assemblages in this area, based on collections from trawl catches carried out during three “Polarstern” cruises in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The set comprises a total of 4, 509 records of abundances of 35 asteroid species (with a total of 2, 089 specimens) and 38 ophiuroid species (with a total of 18, 484 specimens) from 34 stations, as well as of 66 holothurian species (with a total of 20, 918 specimens) from 59 stations including zero-abundances (absences). A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. Overall, starfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers were present at all sites investigated in the study area but composition and abundance of asterozoan (asteroids and ophiuroids together) and holothurian fauna varied considerably. A synthesizing zoogeographical community analysis confirms the presence of three distinct assemblages of asteroids, ophiuroids, and holothurians with highest species richness on the eastern shelf. In the case of asterozoans, water depth and latitude seemed to be the most important drivers of assemblage distribution and composition. One of the holothurian assemblages was part of the rich macrozoobenthic community dominated by a diverse and abundant epifauna, mainly sponges and gorgonians. Another one was mainly composed of vagrant deposit-feeding species inhabiting a predominantly non-colonised substratum. In addition, a mixed holothurian assemblage was identified.","Gutt, J.; Piepenburg, D.; Voß, J.",WOS:000340678700001,"Gutt, Julian, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/zookeys.434.7622,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Asteroidea, ""Asterozoa"", ""Holothuroidea"", ""Ophiuroidea""",,,"Asterozoa, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Holothuroidea, southern and southeastern Weddell Sea, Antarctic, whole-assemblage approach, abundances, community analysis",Data paper,,,"Alfred Wegener Inst Hemholtz, Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Columbusstr, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany.",Germany,Asterozoa; Asteroidea; Ophiuroidea; Holothuroidea; southern and southeastern Weddell Sea; Antarctic; whole-assemblage approach; abundances; community analysis,ECHINODERMATA,Zoology,Zoology,Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI),x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Accounting for traits at the individual level is an important advance in the implementation of trait-based approaches in understanding community structure and function. We incorporate individual- and species-level traits into one succinct assemblage structure metric, fractional size, which is calculated as the length of an individual divided by its potential maximum length. We test the implementation of fractional size in demersal fish assemblages along a depth gradient in the deep sea. We use data from an extensive trawl survey at depths of 300–2030 m on the continental slope of the Rockall Trough, Northeast Atlantic, to compare changes in fractional size structure along an environmental gradient to those seen using traditional taxonomic and trait-based approaches. The relationship between fractional size and depth was particularly strong, with the overall pattern being an increase with depth, implying that individuals move deeper as they grow. Body size increased with depth at the intraspecific and assemblage levels. Fractional size, size structure and species composition all varied among assemblages, and this variation could be explained by the depth that the assemblage occupied. The inclusion of individual-level traits and population fractional size structure adds to our understanding at the assemblage level. Fractional size, or where an individual is in its growth trajectory, appears to be an especially important driver of assemblage change with depth. This has implications for understanding fisheries impacts in the deep sea and how these impacts may propagate across depths.","Mindel, B.L.; Webb, T.J.; Neat, F.C.; Blanchard, J.L.",WOS:000370959300012,"Mindel, Beth, B.L.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Alfred Denny Bldg, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1365-2656.12471,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,bathymetry; deepwater fish; FishBase; functional role; Lmax; ontogeny; Redundancy Analysis; trait-based analysis,Journal article,,,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Alfred Denny Bldg, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",England,bathymetry; deepwater fish; FishBase; functional role; L-max; ontogeny; Redundancy Analysis; trait-based analysis,FISH COMMUNITY INDICATORS; DEMERSAL FISH; SPECIES COMPOSITION; BATHYMETRIC TRENDS; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; LIFE-HISTORIES; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; PREDATORS; ATLANTIC,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,University of Sheffield,,UK,,University,Science

Combining new KuramBio data with previous expedition data in this region has enhanced our understanding abyssal sponge fauna, in particular, the patchiness, rarity, and exceptional richness of the Cladorhizidae family. In total, 14 sponge species, from 7 genera, in 5 families, within two classes (Demospongiae and Hexactinellida) were collected. Of the 14 species, 29% (4 spp.) have been found previously in this region, 36% (5 spp.) were new to the regional abyssal fauna, and 21% (3 spp.) were new to science. The number of abyssal species in this region has now been increased by 26% (8 spp.) and genera by nearly 15% (2 genera). Rarity is a prominent feature of this abyssal fauna, with more than half of species only found at one station, and 83% (19 spp.) of species found previously in this region were not re-found during KuramBio. Cladorhizid sponges dominate demosponge species and genera richness in the abyssal Kurile–Kamchatka region; accounting for 87% (20 spp.) of all demosponge species, and accounting for over 60% (5 genera) of all demosponge genera. Sponge richness in this region is potentially aided by the productivity of the ocean waters, the geological age of the Pacific Ocean, low population densities, and the varied topographic features (ridges, trenches, and seamounts) found in this region. Unusually, the dominance of demosponges in the Kurile–Kamchatka sponge faunal composition is not replicated in other well-sampled abyssal regions, which tend to be richer in deep-sea hexactinellid fauna. Broad depth, latitudinal and longitudinal ranges in Kurile–Kamchatka abyssal fauna are a key characteristic of this faunal assemblage. Strong abyssal faunal connectivity is found between the Kurile–Kamchatka region and North Pacific abyssal fauna, with weaker faunal connections found with the adjacent semi-enclosed seas of Japan and Okhotsk. The importance of the dominant sub-Polar Gyre currents, the vast area of abyssal plain and similar levels of productivity, are likely to be driving the strong faunal connectivity in the North Pacific.

The highest and most consistent rates of nitrate release were among the Thorectidae (0.324 to 0.725 µmol g dry wt<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>), while mycalid and verongid sponges were highly variable (0.024 to 0.743 µmol g dry wt<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>). The ratio of nitrate to ammonium in released nitrogen ranged from 0.1 to 197.0, indicating a wide range of nitrogen release modes by sponges, from predominantly ammonium to very efficient nitrate producers. The study more than doubles the number of temperate sponge species recorded to release nitrate. Nutrient concentrations near the seabed sponge assemblages were higher at low wind speed (a proxy for turbulent mixing). These observations and our measurements of nitrogen release rates from sponges are consistent with the hypothesis that primary production in the region depends on wave-induced mixing at the seabed for resupply of remineralized nitrogen to a nutrient-impoverished water column and that sponges make an important contribution to these fluxes. Based on known biomass of sponges in southwestern Australia, we calculate that sponges may contribute DIN of 1.8 to 3.2 g N m<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>. Taking into account the distribution of sponge habitat across the continental shelf to 100 m depth, this constitutes a contribution of 10% to 18% of the total recycled nitrogen flux required from the benthos to balance a regional nitrogen budget.","Keesing, J.K.; Strzelecki, J.; Fromont, J.; Thomson, D.",WOS:000327395400004,"Keesing, John, J.K.","Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Marine & Atmospher Res, Wembley, WA, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.1947,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Marine & Atmospher Res, Wembley, WA, Australia.",Australia,,DISSOLVED INORGANIC NITROGEN; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; CYANOBACTERIAL SYMBIONTS; LEEUWIN CURRENT; NITRIFICATION; FLUXES; REEF; PHYLOGENY; BACTERIAL,Limnology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),,,,,

We use marine bivalves to relate species-level attributes to successful transition through successive stages of the invasion process. We compiled data on taxonomic composition, body size, life habit and geographic distribution of the Red Sea bivalve fauna from published literature, museum collections and our own field surveys. Using multimodel inference, we examined selectivity of the Lessepsian invasion and identify traits that distinguish successful species at three major stages of invasion: arrival, establishment and spread. The upper limit of bathymetric range and occurrence outside the tropical zone in other regions are the strongest predictors of successful transition through the Suez Canal. Establishment in the Mediterranean is positively correlated with earlier arrival and association with hard-bottom habitats. Preference for hard substrates together with large body size is the primary factor distinguishing invasive aliens representing a significant threat to recipient ecosystems from other established species. The relative strength of abiotic and biotic filters changes along the course of the invasion: environmental affinity and climate match constrain the pool of potential invaders, while the establishment in the new region and invasive status depend on the habitat preferences and life history traits of aliens, affecting their interactions with resident species. Our results together with previous studies suggest that the eastern Mediterranean rocky shores are more susceptible to the establishment of Lessepsian species, many of which may induce strong pressure on recipient communities as ecosystems engineers and competitors of native species.","Nawrot, R.; Chattopadhyay, D.; Zuschin, M.",WOS:000360099700008,"Nawrot, Rafal, R.","Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ddi.12348,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,,, Alien species; biological invasions; biotic interchange; invasive species; Lessepsian migration; marine invasions; Mollusca,Journal article,,,"Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",Austria,Alien species; biological invasions; biotic interchange; invasive species; Lessepsian migration; marine invasions; Mollusca,GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE SIZE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; MARINE BIVALVES; BODY-SIZE; DIFFERENTIATING SUCCESSFUL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; R-SELECTION; INVADERS; FRAMEWORK; HISTORY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Vienna,,Austria,,University,Science

To investigate the general interaction between trestle oyster cultivation and the surrounding intertidal environment, six sites were selected within designated Natura 2000 sites. At each trestle site three Treatment areas were sampled. One Treatment area corresponded to potential impacts associated with cultivation activities occurring at trestle structures (designated the Trestle Treatment) while one Treatment area corresponded to potential impacts due to cultivation activities occurring along access routes (the Access Treatment). An area not subject to any known anthropogenic activity was used as a control (the Control Treatment). Potential impacts associated with Trestle Treatment areas included changes in sediment total organic matter (TOM) levels underneath trestles due to the bio-deposition of faecal/pseudofaecal material while the predominant impact associated with Access Treatment areas was compaction of sediments due to heavy vehicle traffic. In this study, macrobenthic communities at the sites were highly variable and exhibited low levels of diversity which prevented the detection of general effects of cultivation activity on community structure, diversity and secondary production. To overcome this variability, the Infaunal Quality Index (IQI) was used to assess impacts on Ecological Status (ES) of benthic communities (<i>sensu</i> Water Framework Directive). Relative to Control and Trestle Treatment areas, activities occurring at Access Treatment areas had a significant negative impact on ES. This study highlights the potential of the IQI for the management of aquaculture activity and provides validation for the use of the IQI in Irish intertidal environments. This study also highlights the IQI as a potential tool for assessing the conservation status of designated habitats in Natura 2000 sites.","Forde, J.; O'Beirn, F.X.; O’Carroll, J.P.J.; Patterson, A.; Kennedy, R.",WOS:000356741000035,"Patterson, Adrian, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.04.013,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Intertidal oyster cultivation, Ecological Impact, Macrobenthic community composition, biomass and secondary production, Ecological Status assessment, Infaunal Quality Index (IQI)",Journal article,,,"RPS Grp, Lyrr 2, IDA Business & Technol Pk, Galway, Ireland.",Ireland,"Intertidal oyster cultivation; Ecological Impact; Macrobenthic community composition, biomass and secondary production; Ecological Status assessment; Infaunal Quality Index (IQI)",NATURAL VARIABILITY; MUSSEL CULTURE; QUALITY; MACROFAUNA; RECOVERY; BOTTOM; INDICATORS; SEA; AQUACULTURE; ESTUARINE,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,RPS Group,x,Global,,Company,Industry

Over 30 scleractinian coral species, about the same number as documented to date from nearby coral reefs, grow here. No other mangrove ecosystems in the Caribbean are known to have so many coral species. This area may be a refuge from changing climate, as these corals weathered the severe thermal stress and subsequent disease outbreak that caused major coral loss on the island’s coral reefs in 2005 and 2006. Shading by the red mangrove trees reduces the stress that leads to coral bleaching. Seawater temperatures in these mangroves are more variable than those on the reefs, and some studies have shown that this variability results in corals with a greater resistance to higher temperatures. The diversity of sponges and fish is also high, and a new genus of serpulid worm was recently described.

However, the nature of the deglacial environments across the Celtic Sea shelf, the extent of subaerial exposure and the existence (or otherwise) of a contiguous terrestrial linkage between Britain and Ireland following ice retreat remains ambiguous. Multiproxy research, based on analysis of 12 BGS vibrocores from the Celtic Deep Basin (CDB), seeks to address these issues. CDB cores exhibit a shell-rich upward fining sequence of Holocene marine sand above an erosional contact cut in laminated muds with infrequent lonestones. Molluscs, <i>in situ</i> Foraminifera and marine diatoms are absent from the basal muds, but rare damaged freshwater diatoms and foraminiferal linings occur. Dinoflagellate cysts and other non-pollen palynomorphs evidence diverse, environmentally incompatible floras with temperate, boreal and Arctic glaciomarine taxa co-occurring. Such multiproxy records can be interpreted as representing a retreating ice margin, with reworking of marine sediments into a lacustrine basin. Equally, the same record may be interpreted as recording similar conditions within a semi-enclosed marine embayment dominated by meltwater export and deposition of reworked microfossils. As assemblages from these cores contrast markedly with proven glaciomarine sequences from outside the CDB, a glaciolacustrine interpretation is favoured for the laminated sequence, truncated by a Late Weichselian transgressive sequence fining upwards into fully marine conditions. Reworked rare intertidal molluscs from immediately above the regional unconformity provide a minimum date c. 13.9 cal. ka BP for commencement of widespread marine erosion. Although suggestive of glaciolacustrine conditions, the exact nature and timing of laminated sediment deposition within the CDB, and the implications this has on (pen) insularity of Ireland following deglaciation, remain elusive.","Furze, M.F.A.; Scourse, J.D.; Pienkowski, A.J.; Marret, F.; Hobbs, W.O.; Carter, R.A.; Long, B.T.",WOS:000328619600009,"Marret, Fabienne, F.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/bor.12028,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"MacEwan Univ, Dept Phys Sci, Earth & Planetary Sci Div, Edmonton, AB T5J 4S2, Canada.",Canada,,LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; GLACIMARINE SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS; IRISH ICE-SHEET; BRITISH-ISLES; DINOFLAGELLATE CYSTS; LEVEL CHANGE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; SEASONAL STRATIFICATION; SEISMIC STRATIGRAPHY; ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,University of Liverpool,x,UK,,University,Science

However, the high biodiversity and the difficulty of identifying larvae of closely related species represent obstacles to more fully understanding these populations. In this study, we combined morphology and genetic barcoding (Cytochrome Oxidase I gene) to characterize the seasonal patterns of the larval fish community at two sites in close proximity to coral reefs in the central-north Red Sea: one shallower inshore location (50 m depth) and a nearby site located in deeper and more offshore waters (~ 500 m depth). Fish larvae were collected using oblique tows of a 60 cm-bongo net (500 μm mesh size) every month for one year (2013). During the warmer period of the year (June-November), the larval fish stock was comparable between sampling sites. However, during the colder months, abundances were higher in the inshore than in the offshore waters. Taxonomic composition and temporal variation of community structure differed notably between sites, potentially reflecting habitat differences, reproductive patterns of adults, and/or advective processes in the area. Eleven out of a total of 62 recorded families comprised 69–94% of the fish larval community, depending on sampling site and month. Richness of taxa was notably higher in the inshore station compared to the offshore, particularly during the colder period of the year and especially for the gobiids and apogonids. Two mesopelagic taxa (Vinciguerria sp. and Benthosema spp.) comprised an important component of the larval community at the deeper site with only a small and sporadic occurrence in the shallower inshore waters.

The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a ‘Big Data’ approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence–absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identification and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.","Kissling, W.D.; Ahumada, J.A.; Bowser, A.; Fernández, M.; Fernández, N.; García, E.A.; Guralnick, R.P.; Isaac, N.J.B.; Kelling, S.; Los, W.; McRae, L.; Mihoub, J.-B.; Obst, M.; Santamaria, M.; Skidmore, A.K.; Williams, K.J.; Agosti, D.; Amariles, D.; Arvanitidis, C.; Bastin, L.; De Leo, F.; Egloff, W.; Elith, J.; Hobern, D.; Martin, D.; Pereira, H.M.; Pesole, G.; Peterseil, J.; Saarenmaa, H.; Schigel, D.; Schmeller, D.S.; Segata, N.; Turak, E.; Uhlir, P.F.; Wee, B.; Hardisty, A.R.",WOS:000419965700030,"Ahumada, Jorge, J.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/brv.12359,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,big data;biodiversity monitoring;data interoperability;ecological sustainability;environmental policy;global change research;indicators;informatics;metadata;research infrastructures,Journal article,,,"Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Dept Theoret & Computat Ecol, POB 94248, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Netherlands,big data; biodiversity monitoring; data interoperability; ecological sustainability; environmental policy; global change research; indicators; informatics; metadata; research infrastructures,CHALLENGES; OPPORTUNITIES; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; INDICATORS; PRIORITIES; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,University of Amsterdam - Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) - Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE),x,Netherlands,,Research institute,Science

Range size, phylogenetic relatedness and body size also have hypothesized relationships with both latitude and niche breadth, which may further affect niche breadth patterns. Existing terrestrial data are inconclusive and few data exist on latitudinal gradients in niche breadth in the marine realm. We tested the latitude–niche breadth relationship in a marine system while exploring the correlations of both variables with range size, and accounting for relatedness and body size. We compiled a global dataset on the dietary niche breadth of 39 brachyuran crab species from existing studies and additional analyses on species collected in Connecticut and Florida, USA and Bocas del Toro, Panama. Estimates of latitude, range size, clade and body size were obtained for each species. We then tested for correlations among focal variables and examined the strength of their relationships with diet breadth. Latitude was the strongest predictor of niche breadth in temperate species, and the latitude–niche breadth relationship was stronger in larger-bodied species. The strongest predictor of the niche breadth of tropical species was clade, with the newest clade having the narrowest diet. Niche breadth was related to range size for both temperate and tropical species. Tropical species had larger ranges on average than temperate species. We found an interesting division in the niche breadth relationships of temperate and tropical species; diets of temperate species were positively correlated with latitude, range size and body size, and diets of tropical species were related to range size and clade. Therefore, only temperate species demonstrated the predicted positive relationship between niche breadth and latitude, while evolutionary history was a stronger predictor of niche breadth in tropical species.","Papacostas, K.J.; Freestone, A.L.",WOS:000367729100008,"Papacostas, Katherine, K.J.","Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12400,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Brachyura,,,Body size; brachyuran crab; diet; gut content analysis; latitude; niche breadth; phylogenetic relatedness; range size,Journal article,,,"Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",USA,Body size; brachyuran crab; diet; gut content analysis; latitude; niche breadth; phylogenetic relatedness; range size,SPECIES RICHNESS GRADIENT; RANGE LIMITS; BODY-SIZE; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE; HOST-SPECIFICITY; DIVERSITY; MARINE; SPECIALIZATION; VARIABILITY,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Temple University,,USA,,University,Science

This is the case of the copepods of the genus <i>Pseudodiaptomus</i>, first described in the Indian Ocean and considered one of the most resistant to unfavorable conditions but never recorded in the Mediterranean until 2011 though present in adjacent seas. <i>Pseudodiaptomus marinus</i>, in particular, is common in shallow marine-brackish waters and is one of the species often found in ballast waters and in aquaculture plants. Native of Japan, it has started spreading since 1950s and its populations have established in several harbours, eutrophic inlets and lagoons along the coasts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In the last few years, <i>P. marinus</i> has been increasingly reported in European Seas (Mediterranean Sea and North Sea). In this paper, we review the invasion history of this species with a special emphasis on its records in the Mediterranean Sea, and its occurrence and establishment in Sicilian waters. We also compare the biological traits and population dynamics of <i>P. marinus</i> with those of other representative of the genus and discuss about the possible mechanisms of introduction in new environments. Aim of our work is to understand the reasons of successful invasion of <i>P. marinus</i> and the environmental and biological factors that may lead to its further biogeographic expansion.

Because coral health and survival largely depend on the interaction between a coral host and its symbionts, it is important to understand the molecular interactions of an entire “coral holobiont”. We simultaneously sequenced transcriptomes of <i>Porites australiensis</i> and its symbionts using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. We obtained 14.3 Gbp of sequencing data and assembled it into 74,997 contigs (average: 1,263 bp, N50 size: 2,037 bp). We successfully distinguished contigs originating from the host (<i>Porites</i>) and the symbiont (<i>Symbiodinium</i>) by aligning nucleotide sequences with the decoded <i>Acropora digitifera</i> and <i>Symbiodinium minutum</i> genomes. In contrast to previous coral transcriptome studies, at least 35% of the sequences were found to have originated from the symbionts, indicating that it is possible to analyze both host and symbiont transcriptomes simultaneously. Conserved protein domain and KEGG analyses showed that the dataset contains broad gene repertoires of both <i>Porites</i> and <i>Symbiodinium</i>. Effective utilization of sequence reads revealed that the polymorphism rate in <i>P. australiensis</i> is 1.0% and identified the major symbiotic <i>Symbiodinium</i> as Type C15. Analyses of amino acid biosynthetic pathways suggested that this <i>Porites</i> holobiont is probably able to synthesize most of the common amino acids and that <i>Symbiodinium</i> is potentially able to provide essential amino acids to its host. We believe this to be the first molecular evidence of complementarity in amino acid metabolism between coral hosts and their symbionts. We successfully assembled genes originating from both the host coral and the symbiotic <i>Symbiodinium</i> to create a snapshot of the coral holobiont transcriptome. This dataset will facilitate a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms of coral symbioses and stress responses.","Shinzato, C.; Inoue, M.; Kusakabe, M.",WOS:000330235100062,"Shinzato, Chuya, C.","Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Marine Genom Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0085182,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Marine Genom Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan.",Japan,,AMINO-ACID SYNTHESIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANEMONE AIPTASIA; ALGAL SYMBIONTS; GENOME; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCE; CALCIFICATION; ACIDIFICATION; RESILIENCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University,,Japan,,University,Science

The user is offered a choice of several taxonomic reference lists, including the option to upload his/her own list onto the system. Furthermore, BiOnym is a flexible workflow, which embeds and combines techniques using lexical matching algorithms as well as expert knowledge.

Most of the stations were characterised by fine sediments, e.g. silt and sand. In all, 67 quantitative grab samples and 20 qualitative dredge samples were collected.

Areas were pre-selected on the basis of three known oceanographic features, posited to deliver land- or Agulhas Current-derived nutrients onto the shelf and to drive ecosystem functioning in this region. Replicate sediment samples were collected with a 0.2 m2 van Veen grab, during two surveys (A, B) corresponding with normal periods of high and low rainfall, respectively. A subset of the full station array was selected across the shelf in an arrangement of increasing depths (inner-, mid- and outer shelf) through each feature area to investigate the spatial distribution and feeding modes of macrobenthic taxa. The two periods showed some differences in abundance and numbers of macrobenthic taxa, but were not statistically different. Total macrobenthic abundance from Survey A was 20 215 individuals from 642 taxa, decreasing to 18 000 individuals from 503 taxa during Survey B. Polychaeta and Crustacea were the dominant taxa sampled; abundance of the latter was attributed largely to a proliferation of <i>Paguristes</i> sp.1 at inner-shelf samples in the midbight (Thukela) region during Survey B. Similarity classification distinguished seven sample groups reflecting differences in feature areas and shelf positions under investigation. The Thukela River midshelf community supported the highest macrobenthic abundance, while the midshelf off the southern bight (Durban region) was most species rich. Findings were attributed to the habitat complexity of the midshelf which includes a palaeo-dune cordon at the 60 m isobath. Functionally, the community was dominated by interface- and deposit-feeding fauna, emphasising the importance of trophic plasticity in an environmentally variable and heterogeneous shelf environment.","Untiedt, C.B.; MacKay, C.F.",WOS:000381088700007,"Untiedt, C.B.","Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.2989/1814232x.2016.1144651,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"community analysis, continental shelf, feeding guilds, soft sediments, zoobenthos",Journal article,,,"Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa.",South Africa,community analysis; continental shelf; feeding guilds; soft sediments; zoobenthos,CONTINENTAL-SHELF; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BENTHIC MACROFAUNA; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; BUZZARDS BAY; SEDIMENT; ASSEMBLAGES; PATTERNS; DEPOSIT,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI),,South Africa,,Research institute,Science

Changes in <i>Rhizophora</i> (red mangrove) pollen percentages and in mollusk and diatom assemblages indicate major changes in salinity and water depth related to relative sea level rise and possible shifts in precipitation. <i>Rhizophora</i> percentages were highest at 7650 cal yr BP, when mollusk shells indicate the lake was connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

At the same time, monitoring data on biodiversity are requested as key indicators for the state of an ecosystem in most environmental evaluation frameworks. We analyse two monitoring data sets comprising information on abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos communities in the German Wadden Sea in order to evaluate how much information monitoring data on biodiversity provide concerning ecosystem functioning and what implications this information (or the lack thereof) has for future monitoring programmes. Our results show a positive correlation between number of species of macrozoobenthos and its standing stock. Despite differences in overall biomass and individual size in different functional groups, this correlation remained consistent for different feeding guilds and therefore is likely to be independent of certain species traits. Moreover, functional turnover analyses indicate that increasing species richness is needed to maintain biomass levels over increasing periods of time. Whereas our data thus corroborate predictions from theory, we could not determine any causal relationships, because monitoring data commonly include only vague proxies for very few functional parameters, in our case standing biomass as a proxy for production. As to the use of diversity as an indicator for ecosystem functioning, we advise that management decisions are to be based on verified causal relationships and therefore strongly suggest the general incorporation of unambiguous proxies for functional parameters in the measuring campaigns of monitoring programmes.","Hodapp, D.; Kraft, D.; Hillebrand, H.",WOS:000329990300009,"Kraft, Dietmar, D.","Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52428 Julich, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10531-013-0609-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Functional turnover, Ecosystem stability, Tidal flat, Species richness, Evenness, Functional diversity ",Journal article,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM Terramare, Planktol Working Grp, AG Planktol, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",Germany,Functional turnover; Ecosystem stability; Tidal flat; Species richness; Evenness; Functional diversity,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GRASSLAND COMMUNITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; FIELD; RICHNESS; TURNOVER; SERVICES; ECOLOGY,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Although this species has been the subject of occasional studies concerning its ecological role, growth and reproduction, it has been so far almost completely neglected from a genetic and molecular point of view. In the present study we present a high quality de novo assembled transcriptome of the Japanese purplish mussel, which represents the first publicly available collection of expressed sequences for this species.  Results  The assembled transcriptome comprises almost 50,000 contigs, with a N50 statistics of ~1 kilobase and a high estimated completeness based on the rate of BUSCOs identified, standing as one of the most exhaustive sequence resources available for mytiloid bivalves to date. Overall this data, accompanied by gene expression profiles from gills, digestive gland, mantle rim, foot and posterior adductor muscle, presents an accurate snapshot of the great functional specialization of these five tissues in adult mussels  Conclusions  We highlight that one of the most striking features of the <i>M. virgata</i> transcriptome is the high abundance and diversification of lectin-like transcripts, which pertain to different gene families and appear to be expressed in particular in the digestive gland and in the gills. Therefore, these two tissues might be selected as preferential targets for the isolation of molecules with interesting carbohydrate-binding properties.  In addition, by molecular phylogenomics, we provide solid evidence in support of the classification of <i>M. virgata</i> within the Brachidontinae subfamily. This result is in agreement with the previously proposed hypothesis that the morphological features traditionally used to group <i>Mytilisepta</i> spp. and <i>Septifer</i> spp. within the same clade are inappropriate due to homoplasy.","Gerdol, M.; Fujii, Y.; Hasan, I.; Koike, T.; Shimojo, S.; Spazzali, F.; Yamamoto, K.; Ozeki, Y.; Pallavicini, A.; Fujita, H.",WOS:000408034200004,"Gerdol, Marco, M.","Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via Giorgieri 5, I-34126 Trieste, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s12864-017-4012-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,Mussel Transcriptome RNA-seq Lectins Phylogenomics Bivalve Mollusk,Journal article,,,"Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Via Giorgieri 5, I-34126 Trieste, Italy.",Italy,Mussel; Transcriptome; RNA-seq; Lectins; Phylogenomics; Bivalve; Mollusk,C-TYPE LECTIN; RNA-SEQ DATA; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; PEARL OYSTER; PINCTADA-FUCATA; EASTERN OYSTER; MARINE BIVALVE; ROCKY SHORE; PROTEIN,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,University of Trieste,,Italy,,University,Science

Marine ecosystems, too, are increasingly threatened, and marine restoration efforts are escalating. But the methods and motivations for marine restoration are varied, so the extent to which they involve conservation-motivated translocations is unclear. Because translocations involve considerable risks, building on previous experience to establish and implement best practice guidelines for policy application is imperative. We conducted a global literature review to determine what marine conservation translocation experience exists. Our review indicates marine conservation translocations are widespread and increasingly common. Reinforcements and reintroductions predominate, but precedent for assisted colonizations and ecological replacements also exists. In 39 years, 487 translocation projects were conducted to conserve over 242 marine species or their ecosystems. Most projects involved coastal invertebrates (44%) or plants (30%). Few species were of conservation concern according to the IUCN Red List, likely reflecting the leading objective for most (60%) marine conservation translocations, which was ecosystem rather than species recovery. With currently no standard metrics for evaluating translocation success or ecosystem function, we recommend future projects follow the relevant IUCN guidelines and identify specific targets to measure the efficacy of translocations.","Swan, K.D.; McPherson, J.M.; Seddon, J.P.; Moehrenschlager, A.",WOS:000381025700001,"Swan, Kelly, K.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/conl.12217,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Assisted colonization; conservation translocation; ecological replacement; ecosystem recovery; oceans, marine; reinforcement; reintroduction; species recovery",Journal article,,,"Calgary Zool Soc, Ctr Conservat Res, 1300 Zoo Rd NE, Calgary, AB T2E 7V6, Canada.",Canada,Assisted colonization; conservation translocation; ecological replacement; ecosystem recovery; oceans; marine; reinforcement; reintroduction; species recovery,CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESTORATION; COASTAL; SUCCESS; REANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; SCIENCE; BIAS,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,Calgary Zoological Society - Conservation Research Centre,x,Canada,,Research institute,Science

These analyses provide an overview of the development of these estuaries over the last ∼7500 years. Palynological data reveal climate-driven vegetational shifts over the whole period. Microfauna, which is composed predominantly of foraminifers and ostracods, provides evidence for periods of marine and brackish water conditions, observed in both estuaries. Whereas the sediment record from the Alvor estuary shows a clear, nearly continuous silting-up sequence, the development of the Alcantarilha estuary is characterised by fluvial sedimentation, replaced by a marine environment at about 7300 yr cal BP. Marine transgression is indicated by marine-brackish foraminifera and ostracod assemblages, while upper-marsh pollen decreased and wetland communities increased at the same time. A continuous shallowing of the estuaries followed between ∼6700 yr cal BP and ∼5700 yr cal BP in Alvor and 4500 yr cal BP in Alcantarilha. This was interrupted by a distinct high-energy event, possibly a storm or tsunami, between 6400 and 5800 yr cal BP in Alvor; the event was not recorded in the Alcantarilha estuary. Afterwards, the silting-up restarted with clear similarities to the pre-event situation and continued until ∼3500/2000 yr cal BP. This process was influenced by the build-up of sand barriers in front of the estuaries. This is also documented by a higher percentage of upper-marsh vegetation. The core from Alcantarilha estuary shows another layer of high-energy deposits, with mainly marine foraminifers and ostracods after 4500 yr cal BP. The youngest parts of the two records are characterised by decreasing tidal influence and increasing anthropogenic impact, indicated by increasing values of cultivated plants and other human-induced changes of vegetation cover.","Trog, C.; Höfer, D.; Frenzel, P.; Camacho, S.; Schneider, H.; Mäusbacher, R.",,"Höfer, Dana, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.revmic.2013.10.003,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Foraminifera, ""Ostracoda""",,,"Ostracoda, Foraminifera, Pollen, Brackish water, Salinity, Multi-proxy, NE Atlantic, Holocene sea level, Algarve coast",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the highly resolved late Cenozoic fossil records of four major taxa of marine plankton, we show that their gradients arise as a consequence of asymmetric geographic range expansion rather than latitudinal variation in diversification rate, as commonly believed. Neither per capita speciation nor extinction rates trend significantly with temperature or latitude for these marine plankton. Species of planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton that originate in the temperate zone preferentially spread toward and arrive earlier in the tropics to produce a normal gradient with tropical diversity peaks; by contrast, temperate-zone originating species of diatoms and radiolarians preferentially spread toward and arrive earlier in polar Regions to produce reversed gradients with high-latitude diversity peaks. Our results suggest that temperature affects latitudinal diversity gradients chiefly by its effect on species’ range limits rather than on probabilities of speciation and extinction. We show that this mechanism also appears to operate in various multicellular taxa, thus providing a widely applicable explanation for the origin of latitudinal diversity gradients.","Powell, M.G.; Glazier, D.S.",WOS:000399414600003,"Powell, Matthew, M.G.","Juniata Coll, Dept Geol, 1700 Moore St, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/pab.2016.38,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Juniata Coll, Dept Geol, 1700 Moore St, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA.",USA,,SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY GRADIENT; TROPICAL CONSERVATISM; DIVERSIFICATION RATES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; RELATIVE ROLES; DEEP-SEA; EVOLUTIONARY; TEMPERATURE; ORIGINATION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Juniata College,,USA,,University,Science

We tested the hypothesis that a change in nutrient composition defines the alternation of these algae. Data on phytoplankton, nutrients, chlorophyll and primary production were obtained in May–June from 2002 to 2012. Coccolithophore bloom dynamics were analysed using satellite images of particular inorganic carbon (PIC). In some years coccolithophore bloom occupied the sea interior and has spread on shelf areas. Most frequently blooms occurred in the coastal waters and were absent in the deep basin. Diatoms and coccolithophores interchangeably prevailed in phytoplankton. In the coastal waters, high biomass of diatoms corresponded to the increased ammonium. In the deep basin, PIC was positively correlated with phosphate and negatively with the sea air temperature in February indicating that the bottom-up flux of pycnocline waters during winter convection is the main driver of coccolithophore bloom. In the coastal zone, high concentrations of phosphate and PIC corresponded to high precipitation periods. Thus, independent from origin, phosphorus might have determined the development of coccolithophores both in the coastal and deep waters. In general, diatoms predominated in phytoplankton at high nitrogen:phosphorus ratio, whereas coccolithophores at low.","Mikaelyan, A.S.; Pautova, L.A.; Chasovnikov, V.K.; Mosharov, S.A.; Silkin, V.A.",WOS:000356039300007,"Mikaelyan, Alexander, A.S.","PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol RAS, Moscow, Russia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-015-2219-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Bacillariophyceae, ""Coccolithophora""",,,"Phytoplankton, Diatoms, Coccolithophores, Interannual dynamics, Nutrients, Precipitation, Black Sea ",Journal article,,,"PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol RAS, Moscow, Russia.",Russia,Phytoplankton; Diatoms; Coccolithophores; Interannual dynamics; Nutrients; Precipitation; Black Sea,CHLOROPHYLL-A; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; BLOOMS; EUTROPHICATION; PHOSPHORUS; NITRATE; RATIOS; REGIME; GROWTH,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS),,Russia,,University,Science

Although the recent integration of genetic and micromorphological data is helping to clarify the taxonomic confusion within the order, phylogenetic relationships and species delimitation within most coral genera are still far from settled. In the present study, the species boundaries in the scleractinian coral genus <i>Goniopora</i> were investigated using 199 colonies from the Saudi Arabian Red Sea and sequencing of four molecular markers: the mitochondrial intergenic spacer between CytB and NAD2, the nuclear ribosomal ITS region, and two single-copy nuclear genes (ATPsβ and CalM). DNA sequence data were analyzed using a variety of methods and exploratory species-delimitation tools. The results were broadly congruent in identifying five distinct molecular lineages within the sequenced Goniopora samples: <i>G. somaliensis/G. savignyi, G. djiboutiensis/G. lobata, G. stokesi, G. albiconus/G. tenuidens</i>, and <i>G. minor/G. graciles</i>. Although the traditional macromorphological characters used to identify these nine morphospecies were not able to discriminate the obtained molecular clades, informative micromorphological and microstructural features (such as the micro-ornamentation and the arrangement of the columella) were recovered among the five lineages. Moreover, unique <i>in vivo</i> morphologies were associated with the genetic-delimited lineages, further supporting the molecular findings. This study represents the first attempt to identify species boundaries within <i>Goniopora</i> using a combined morpho-molecular approach. The obtained data establish a basis for future taxonomic revision of the genus, which should include colonies across its entire geographical distribution in the Indo-Pacific.","Terraneo, T.I.; Benzoni, F.; Arrigoni, R.; Berumen, M.L.",WOS:000380622600025,"Terraneo, Tullia, T.I.","King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.06.003,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"GMYC, PTP, ABGD, Haplowebs, DNA taxonomy, Integrative taxonomy",Journal article,,,"King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",Saudi Arabia,GMYC; PTP; ABGD; Haplowebs; DNA taxonomy; Integrative taxonomy,INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACERS; NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL DNA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; ACROPORA SCLERACTINIA; PSAMMOCORA CNIDARIA; SEQUENCE EVOLUTION; HAWAIIAN CORALS; REEF CORALS; MITOCHONDRIAL; BOUNDARIES,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,,Saudi Arabia,,University,Science

In this study, open source and relic data were used in combination with new grab survey data to model EUNIS level 4 biotope distributions in Galway Bay, Ireland. The correct prediction rates of two artificial neural networks (ANNs) were compared to assess the effectiveness of acoustic sediment classifications versus sediments that were visually classified by an expert in the field as predictor variables.To test for autocorrelation between predictor variables the RELATE routine with Spearman rank correlation method was used. Optimal models were derived by iteratively removing predictor variables and comparing the correct prediction rates of each model. The models with the highest correct prediction rates were chosen as optimal. The optimal models each used combination of salinity (binary; 0 = polyhaline and 1 = euhaline), proximity to reef (binary; 0 = within 50 m and 1 = outside 50 m), depth (continuous; metres) and a sediment descriptor (acoustic or observed) as predictor variables. As the status of benthic habitats is required to be assessed under the MSFD the Ecological Status (ES) of the subtidal sediments of Galway Bay were also assessed using the Infaunal Quality Index.ANNs that used observed sediment classes as predictor variables could correctly predict the distribution of biotopes 67% of the time, compared to 63% for ANNs using acoustic sediment classes. Acoustic sediment ANN predictions were affected by local sediment heterogeneity, and the lack of a mixed sediment class. The all-round poor performance of ANNs is likely to be a result of the sparsely distributed data within the study area.","O’Carroll, J.P.J.; Kennedy, R.; Ren, L.; Nash, S.; Hartnett, M.; Brown, C.",WOS:000412252800024,"Ren, Lei, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2017.08.005,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Sch Nat Sci, Zool, Galway, Ireland.",Ireland,,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BENTHIC ECOLOGICAL STATUS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS; TRESTLE CULTIVATION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; MULTIBEAM SONAR; ENGLISH-CHANNEL; NORTH-SEA; TOP-DOWN,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,National University of Ireland Galway - Ryan Institute (NUIG-RI) - School of Natural Science - Galway,x,Ireland,,Research institute,Science

Anatomical data corroborate this grouping and, in conjunction with their phylogenetic placement, support their recognition as a new subfamily, the Anentominae. The assassin snail <i>Anentome helena</i>, a popular import through the aquarium trade so named for their voracious appetite for other snails, is found to comprise a complex of at least four species. None of these likely represents true <i>Anentome helena</i> described from Java, including a specimen purchased through the aquarium trade under this name in the US and one that was recently found introduced in Singapore, both of which were supported as conspecific with a species from Thailand. The introduction of <i>Anentome</i> “<i>helena</i>” through the aquarium trade constitutes a significant threat to native aquatic snail faunas which are often already highly imperiled. Comprehensive systematic revision of this previously unrecognized species complex is urgently needed to facilitate communication and manage this emerging threat.","Strong, E.E.; Galindo, L.A.; Kantor, Y.I.",WOS:000411940900001,"Strong, Ellen, E.E.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.7717/peerj.3638,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Anatomy, Phylogeny, Biogeography, Freshwater, Invasive species, Systematics, Taxonomy, Biodiversity",Journal article,,,"Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",USA,Anatomy; Phylogeny; Biogeography; Freshwater; Invasive species; Systematics; Taxonomy; Biodiversity,FRESH-WATER GASTROPODS; SULCOSPIRA TROSCHEL; MOLLUSCA; BUCCINIDAE; MORPHOLOGY; PHYLOGENY; GENUS; CAENOGASTROPODA; NEOGASTROPODA; CERITHIOIDEA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Smithsonian Institution - Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History - Department of Invertebrate Zoology,,USA,,Museum,Science

Here, we studied two tunicates living in sympatry, and sometimes in syntopy, in the English Channel, <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> species A (presumed native to the NW Pacific) and species B (native to the N Atlantic). In addition to monitoring their co-existence over time, we examined the level of interspecific gene flow, a process that may increase the invasiveness of the non-native species. The sampling scheme was repeated twice a year for 3 years (six distinct generations) to determine the relative abundance of the two species in 11 localities along the coasts of the English Channel and the Iroise Sea (covering 1600 km) in Brittany, France. We examined 23,000 individuals, including 5315 specimens for which reproductive status was determined. Four species-diagnostic molecular markers traced interspecific gene flow on a random subset of 3048 individuals. Regardless of the sampling date, the two species co-occurred in most of the study sites, with species A showing higher frequency in the autumn. The regional pattern of seasonal variation in relative abundance of the two congeners appears to correspond to different thermal growth optima. Abrupt variations in environmental parameters can act synergistically and may favor the non-native species locally. Despite syntopy, synchronous gamete production and successful in vitro interspecific crosses, only 4.3 % individuals showed an admixed genome (i.e. footprint of present-day or past introgression events), most of them with a species A maternal lineage, of which only one was a putative first generation hybrid. Altogether, efficient barriers seem to prevent interspecific crosses between the two interfertile congeners in the wild: present-day hybridization may have less impact than competitive interactions on the fate of the two study species over their sympatric range.","Bouchemousse, S.; Lévêque, L.; Dubois, G.; Viard, F.",WOS:000368714000006,"Lévêque, Laurent, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10682-015-9788-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Ascidiacea, ""Ciona intestinalis""",,,"Ascidians, Biological invasion, Ciona intestinalis species complex, Environmental preferences, Interspecific gene flow, Reproductive barriers",Journal article,,,"Equipe Div&Co, CNRS, Stn Biol Roscoff, UMR 7144, Pl Georges Teissier, F-29680 Roscoff, France.",France,Ascidians; Biological invasion; Ciona intestinalis species complex; Environmental preferences; Interspecific gene flow; Reproductive barriers,MUSSELS MYTILUS-EDULIS; CIONA-INTESTINALIS L; GENETIC-DIVERGENCE; SPECIES COMPLEX; INTROGRESSION; MODEL; EVOLUTION; INVASIONS; HYBRIDS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,,,,,,

Data analysis using hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling with class as taxonomic entries suggested that water masses followed by depth was the dominant effect on eukaryotic micro-organism diversity.

At the present time, the main challenge is to define the status of the site by describing its formation dynamics. This necessitates investigating the taphonomic and erosive mechanisms using a combined method adapted to the shell midden levels, before undertaking spatial analysis. The archaeological level is protected by a thick dune and is subdivided into several stratigraphic units (SU), which record several changes in the function of the site. It is made up of accumulations of shell pockets covered in sandy sediments. The micromorphological analysis shows that this waste area seems to develop into an area of activities and movement. These surfaces also record alternating dry and wet seasonal conditions, but with no phase of abandonment. Systematic pH measurements show variations of 7.7 to 9.0 depending on the layers, corresponding to a slightly alkaline to alkaline acid-basic status. The mapping of measurements can be correlated to structures and archaeological remains of organic origin. The excavation shows that the division of the dwelling area was guided by topographic factors, with a circular dwelling 3.50 m in diameter installed on a flat zone and a shell waste zone on a slope towards the sea. Numerous fire-related activities were also carried out in this zone (pits, hearths). Spatial analysis by GIS shows a high concentration of recorded objects (lithics, bones, shells) to the west of the excavated area, in the shell level. Marine erosion is the main erosive factor limiting our knowledge of the site. The distance to the coastline was estimated after reconstruction of the relative sea level during the Holocene using the “Sea-Level Index Points” (SLIPs) methodology. Three SLIPs indicate a relative sea-level position between − 15.5 m and − 11 m and a foreshore area at a depth between − 7.15 and − 14.02 m around 6200 BCE. This paleogeographic reconstruction approach indicates that the site of Beg-er-Vil was located a few hundred to a few kilometres from the coastline.","Marchand, G.; Dupont, C.; Laforge, M.; Le Bannier, J.-C.; Netter, C.; Nukushina, D.; Onfray, M.; Querré, G.; Quesnel, L.; Stéphan, P.",WOS:000430788500090,"Dupont, Catherine, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.07.014,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,MesolithicMicromorphologySea-level index pointsShell midden,Journal article,,,"Univ Rennes 1, Lab Archeosci, CNRS, UMR 6566,CREAAH, Batiment 24-25,CS74205, F-35042 Rennes, France.",France,Mesolithic; Micromorphology; Sea-level index points; Shell midden,HUNTER-GATHERERS; EVOLUTION; SHELL; ICE,Archaeology,Archaeology,"Joint Research Unit: Centre de Recherche en Archéologie, Archéosciences, Histoire (CReAAH) (UMR 6566)",x,France,,Research network,Science

Besides pallial or cephalic tentacles, subocular tentacles, neck lobes and (occasionally) copulatory structures, there are epipodial tentacles and epipodial sense organs (ESOs), which have often been confused in the past. We provide clear definitions of these two different epipodial structures, describe various examples and reconsider literature data on their occurrence throughout basal gastropod clades, i.e. Patellogastropoda, Cocculiniformia, Neritimorpha, Neomphalina and (in particular) Vetigastropoda. So-called ‘epipodial tentacles’ of Patellogastropoda, Cocculiniformia, Neomphalina and of several vetigastropod subgroups are considered to represent a distinct and apomorphic gastropod organ, the ESO. In contrast, true epipodial tentacles are probably serial or iterative homologues of cephalic tentacles and are restricted to Vetigastropoda and certain caenogastropod taxa. In the light of these new data and interpretations, an evolutionary scenario is presented for epipodial structures in basal gastropods: a single pair of ESOs in a posterior position is considered as an apomorphic character of the gastropod stem lineage, which is retained in early juvenile Patellogastropoda, many Cocculiniformia and early juvenile Vetigastropoda. The various conditions in Neomphalina and Vetigastropoda can be explained by considering modularity of ESOs, cephalic/epipodial tentacles and sensory papillae. Each of these modules has become serially repeated in evolution and occurs in various combinations among basal gastropod clades.","Haszprunar, G.; Kunze, T.; Warén, A.; Heß, M.",WOS:000414337100001,"Heß, Martin, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyx032,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Zool Staatssammlung Munchen, SNSB, Munchhausenstr 21, D-81247 Munich, Germany.",Germany,,ADDISONIA-EXCENTRICA TIBERI; PACIFIC HYDROTHERMAL VENTS; DEEP-SEA; MOLLUSCA-VETIGASTROPODA; LIMPETS MOLLUSCA; SYSTEMATIC POSITION; CHORISTELLIDAE ARCHAEOGASTROPODA; SUPERFAMILY TROCHOIDEA; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; COCCULINIFORM LIMPETS,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,,,,,,

In practice, however, it is unknown how effective PAs will be in shielding native species from invasions under projected climate change. Here, we investigate the current and future potential distributions of 100 of the most invasive terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species in Europe. We use this information to evaluate the combined threat posed by climate change and invasions to existing PAs and the most susceptible species they shelter. We found that only a quarter of Europe's marine and terrestrial areas protected over the last 100 years have been colonized by any of the invaders investigated, despite offering climatically suitable conditions for invasion. In addition, hotspots of invasive species and the most susceptible native species to their establishment do not match at large continental scales. Furthermore, the predicted richness of invaders is 11%–18% significantly lower inside PAs than outside them. Invasive species are rare in long-established national parks and nature reserves, which are actively protected and often located in remote and pristine regions with very low human density. In contrast, the richness of invasive species is high in the more recently designated Natura 2000 sites, which are subject to high human accessibility. This situation may change in the future, since our models anticipate important shifts in species ranges toward the north and east of Europe at unprecedented rates of 14–55 km/decade, depending on taxonomic group and scenario. This may seriously compromise the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the resistance that PAs provide against biological invasions and climate change on a continental scale and illustrates their strategic value in safeguarding native biodiversity.","Gallardo, B.; Aldridge, D.C.; González-Moreno, P.; Pergl, J.; Pizarro, M.; Pysek, P.; Thuiller, W.; Yesson, C.; Vilá, M.",WOS:000414969000032,"Aldridge, David, D.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.13798,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""EUROBIS ackn - indirect use"", ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,climate suitability;human accessibility;national parks;Natura 2000;nature reserves;non-native species;protected species;species distribution models,Journal article,,,"Pyrenean Inst Ecol IPE CSIC, Dept Biodivers & Restorat, Zaragoza, Spain.",Spain,climate suitability; human accessibility; national parks; Natura 2000; nature reserves; non-native species; protected species; species distribution models,EXTINCTION RISK; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; FUTURE; SHIFTS; SEA; PATTERNS; MODELS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CSIC - Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE) - Department of Biodiversity & Restoration,x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

There were 48 new entries since 2011 which can be interpreted as approximately one new entry every two weeks. The number of alien species continues to increase, by 2-3 species per year for macrophytes, molluscs and polychaetes, 3-4 species per year for crustaceans, and 6 species per year for fish. The dominant group among alien species is molluscs (with 215 species), followed by crustaceans (159) and polychaetes (132). Macrophytes are the leading group of NIS in the ADRIA and the WMED, reaching 26-30% of all aliens, whereas in the EMED they barely constitute 10% of the introductions. In the EMED, molluscs are the most species-rich group, followed by crustaceans, fish and polychaetes. More than half (54%) of the marine alien species in the Mediterranean were probably introduced by corridors (mainly Suez). Shipping is blamed directly for the introduction of only 12 species, whereas it is assumed to be the most likely pathway of introduction (via ballasts or fouling) of another 300 species. For approximately 100 species shipping is a probable pathway along with the Suez Canal and/or aquaculture. Approximately 20 species have been introduced with certainty via aquaculture, while >50 species (mostly macroalgae), occurring in the vicinity of oyster farms, are assumed to be introduced accidentally as contaminants of imported species. A total of 18 species are assumed to have been introduced by the aquarium trade. Lessepsian species decline westwards, while the reverse pattern is evident for ship-mediated species and for those introduced with aquaculture. There is an increasing trend in new introductions via the Suez Canal and via shipping.","Zenetos, A.; Gofas, S.; Morri, C.; Rosso, A.; Violanti, D.; Garcia-Raso, J.E.; Cinar, M.E.; Almogi-Labin, A.; Ates, A.S.; Azzurro, E.; Ballesteros, E.; Bianchi, C.N.; Bilecenoglu, M.; Gambi, M.C.; Giangrande, A.; Gravili, C.; Hyams-Kaphzan, O.; Karachle, P.K.; Katsanevakis, S.; Lipej, L.; Mastrototaro, F.; Mineur, F.; Pancucci-Papadopoulou, M.A.; Ramos Espla, A.; Salas, C.; San Martín, G.; Sfriso, A.; Streftaris, N.; Verlaque, M.",WOS:000315934300019,"Violanti, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.12681/mms.327,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Biological invasions, marine aliens, biogeography, trends, pathways, Mediterranean Sea",Journal article,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, POB 712, Anavissos 19013, Greece.",Greece,Biological invasions; marine aliens; biogeography; trends; pathways; Mediterranean Sea,1ST RECORD; INDO-PACIFIC; ANNELIDA POLYCHAETA; SOUTHERN COAST; VENICE LAGOON; ADRIATIC SEA; AEGEAN SEA; BRYOZOA; FORAMINIFERA; CNIDARIA,"Fisheries; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography",Fisheries; Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR),x,,,,

Although insight into their ecology and biogeography is important for predicting species-specific sensitivities to ocean change, the species abundances and biogeographical distributions of pteropods and heteropods are still poorly known. Here, we examined abundance and distribution patterns of pteropods (euthecosomes, pseudothecosomes, gymnosomes) and heteropods at 31 stations along a transect from 46°N to 46°S across the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean (Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise AMT24). We collected a total of 7312 pteropod specimens belonging to at least 31 species. Pteropod abundances were low north of 40°N with <15 individuals per 1000 m<sup>3</sup>, varied between 100 and 2000 ind./1000 m<sup>3</sup> between 30°N and 40°S, and reached >4000 ind./1000 m<sup>3</sup> just south of 40°S. This accounted for an estimated biomass of 3.2 mg m<sup>-3</sup> south of 40°S and an average of 0.49 mg m<sup>-3</sup> along the entire transect. Species richness of pteropods was highest in the stratified (sub)tropical waters between 30°N and 30°S, with a maximum of 15 species per station. The biogeographical distribution of pteropod assemblages inferred by cluster analysis was largely congruent with the distribution of Longhurst’s biogeochemical provinces. Some pteropod species distributions were limited to particular oceanographic provinces, for example, subtropical gyres (e.g. <i>Styliola subula</i>) or warm equatorial waters (e.g. <i>Creseis virgule</i>). Other species showed much broader distributions between ∼35°N and ∼35°S (e.g. <i>Limacina bulimoides</i> and <i>Heliconoides inflatus</i>). We collected 1812 heteropod specimens belonging to 18 species. Highest heteropod abundances and species richness were found between 30°N and 20°S, with up to ∼700 ind./1000 m<sup>3</sup> and a maximum of 14 species per station. Heteropods were not restricted to tropical and subtropical waters, however, as some taxa were also relatively abundant in subantarctic waters. Given the variation in distribution patterns among pteropod and heteropod species, it is likely that species will differ in their response to ocean changes.","Burridge, A.K.; Goetze, E.; Wall-Palmer, D.; Le Double, S.L.; Huisman, J.; Peijnenburg, K.T.C.A.",WOS:000418978400015,"Burridge, Alice, A.K.","Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2016.10.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Heteropoda, ""Pteropoda""",,,"Pteropods, Heteropods, Atlantic Ocean, Biogeography, Species diversity, Abundance, Biomass, Ocean acidification",Journal article,,,"Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Pteropods; Heteropods; Atlantic Ocean; Biogeography; Species diversity; Abundance; Biomass; Ocean acidification,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; ZOOPLANKTON; SIZE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; RICHNESS; BIOMASS,Oceanography,Oceanography,Naturalis Biodiversity Center,,Netherlands,,Museum,Science

Because the diversity and biogeography of this group in oceanic waters is poorly known, we examined diversity and distribution patterns of hyperiids along a basin-scale meridional transect in the Atlantic Ocean (Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise 22). Hyperiids were collected from epipelagic and upper mesopelagic depths at 27 stations between 39°N and 45°S. A total of 70 species in 36 genera and 17 families were identified, the majority of which belonged to the epipelagic Physocephalata infraorder. We observed maximum species and genus richness in the equatorial upwelling region (up to 35 species, 27 genera per station; 7°N–8°S), which appeared largely driven by increased diversity in the superfamily Platysceloidea, as well as a significant and positive relationship between species richness and sea surface temperature. Cluster analyses of hyperiid species assemblages along the transect broadly supported a division into gyral, equatorial, transitional, and subantarctic assemblages, congruent with Longhurst’s biogeochemical provinces. Steepest transitions in hyperiid species composition occurred at the southern subtropical convergence zone (34–38°S). The majority of zooplankton groups show maximal diversity in subtropical waters, and our observations of equatorial maxima in species and genus richness for hyperiids suggest that the mechanisms controlling diversity in this group are distinct from other zooplanktonic taxa. These patterns may be driven by the distribution and diversity of gelatinous hosts for hyperiids, which remain poorly characterized at ocean basin scales. The data reported here provide new distributional records for epipelagic and upper mesopelagic hyperiids across six major oceanic provinces in the Atlantic Ocean.","Burridge, A.K.; Tump, M.; Vonk, R.; Goetze, E.; Peijnenburg, K.T.C.A.",WOS:000418978400016,"Burridge, Alice, A.K.","Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2016.08.003,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Amphipoda, ""Hyperiidea""",,,"Amphipods, Hyperiidea, Atlantic Ocean, Latitudinal diversity gradient, Biogeography",Journal article,,,"Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Amphipods; Hyperiidea; Atlantic Ocean; Latitudinal diversity gradient; Biogeography,GULF-OF-MEXICO; GELATINOUS-ZOOPLANKTON; THEMISTO-GAUDICHAUDII; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GLOBAL PATTERNS; SARGASSO SEA; ASSOCIATIONS; CRUSTACEA; ABUNDANCE,Oceanography,Oceanography,Naturalis Biodiversity Center,,Netherlands,,Museum,Science

The ultimate consequences of misspelled names and bad taxonomy are erroneous scientific conclusions and faulty policy decisions. The lack of tools for correcting this ‘names problem’ has become a fundamental obstacle to integrating disparate data sources and advancing the progress of biodiversity science. The TNRS, or Taxonomic Name Resolution Service, is an online application for automated and user-supervised standardization of plant scientific names. The TNRS builds upon and extends existing open-source applications for name parsing and fuzzy matching. Names are standardized against multiple reference taxonomies, including the Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database. Capable of processing thousands of names in a single operation, the TNRS parses and corrects misspelled names and authorities, standardizes variant spellings, and converts nomenclatural synonyms to accepted names. Family names can be included to increase match accuracy and resolve many types of homonyms. Partial matching of higher taxa combined with extraction of annotations, accession numbers and morphospecies allows the TNRS to standardize taxonomy across a broad range of active and legacy datasets. We show how the TNRS can resolve many forms of taxonomic semantic heterogeneity, correct spelling errors and eliminate spurious names. As a result, the TNRS can aid the integration of disparate biological datasets. Although the TNRS was developed to aid in standardizing plant names, its underlying algorithms and design can be extended to all organisms and nomenclatural codes. The TNRS is accessible via a web interface at http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/ and as a RESTful web service and application programming interface.

The Echinoderm fauna of Europa, Eparses Island, (Scattered Islands) in the Mozambique channel (South Western Indian Ocean). <i>Cah. Biol. Mar. 54(4)</i>: 499-504","Europa is one of the Eparses Islands, French islands scattered in the Mozambique Channel. They are isolated islands of coral origin, without permanent human population. This situation makes them good candidates to evaluate the evolution of biodiversity without direct anthropogenic influences. Knowledge is still scarce because their accessibility is limited. With the idea of classifying them as Marine Protected Areas, a management plan is required based on the coral reef communities. Among several aims, the program BioReCIE (Biodiversity, Resources and Conservation of Eparses Islands) was to complete the inventories of several marine groups, including the echinoderms, which had never been assessed before. In November 2011, a multidisciplinary team explored the reef slopes of the island by scuba diving down to 20 meters (10 sites), and the reef flats at low tide (14 sites, including the lagoon surrounded by mangrove), collecting and taking photos of the organisms which have been preserved in 95% ethanol and identified. The total species richness for echinoderms was 39 including 4 Crinoidea, 8 Echinoidea, 5 Asteroidea, with <i>Aquilonastra chantalae</i> a new species, 13 Ophiuroidea and 9 Holothuroidea. Twenty three species were collected on the slopes and 21 on the reef flats. Given the limited number of sites studied, the occurrence of the different species in each class is presented as frequent, infrequent or rare. The semi quantitative measure of abundance identified populations with high densities, as <i>Stichopus chloronotus, Ophiocoma scolopendrina</i> and <i>Echinometra mathaei</i> on the reef flats. Several species were only collected as juveniles. On the slopes <i>Echinostrephus molaris, Ophiothela danae</i> and diadematids were frequent, but with lower densities. On the whole the echinoderm fauna is not very diverse, nor abundant, except on the reef flats; the presence of holothurians near the lagoon entrance, in a mangrove habitat is notable.","Conand, C.; Stöhr, S.; Eleaume, M.; Magalon, H.; Chabanet, P.",WOS:000326954200006,"Eleaume, Marc, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Echinodermata, diversity, occurence, abundance, reef slope, reef flats",Journal article,,,"Univ Reunion, Lab Ecol Marine, St Denis 97715, Reunion, France.",France,Echinodermata; Diversity; Occurrence; Abundance; Reef slope; Reef flats,CHECKLIST; DECAPODA; REEFS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Reunion - Marine Ecology Lab,x,France,,Research institute,Science

Until recently, <i>T. noae</i> was considered conspecific with <i>T. maxima</i>. However, in this study, among the four genes (COI, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA) examined, two (i.e., 16S rRNA and COI) genes grouped <i>T. maxima</i> into two distinct clades, suggesting that a cryptic species was involved. The genetic distance of the 16S rRNA gene between <i>T. maxima</i> and cryptic species was 0.042–0.048. In contrast, the differences within the clades comprising <i>T. maxima</i> and the cryptic species were 0–0.003 and 0–0.005, respectively. A careful comparison of morphological traits revealed differences between T. maxima and the cryptic species, and the shells of the latter species were consistent with the figures referred to by Röding for the species he named ‘<i>noae</i>’. <i>Tridacna noae</i> differs from <i>T. maxima</i> in the appearance and arrangement of hyaline organs on the mantle in living specimens. In contrast, shell characters such as numbers of radial ribs and prominence of rib scales, were relatively unreliable. Occasionally, prominent rib scales only grew in one valve of an individual, e.g., in one <i>T. maxima</i> specimen from Hongchia.

We conducted 6 sampling cruises in the bights of Shen-Aou Bay and Fan-Zai-Aou Bay to investigate seasonal variations in copepod communities in northeastern Taiwan from Oct. 2007 to Jan. 2009. The sample included 76 species of copepods belonging to 4 orders, 22 families, and 36 genera identified in these 2 bays in northeastern Taiwan. The most abundant species were <i>Temora turbinate</i> (with a relative abundance (RA) of 29.34%), <i>Paracalanus parvus</i> (of 21.98%), <i>Canthocalanus pauper</i> (of 7.86%), <i>Calanus sinicus</i> (of 4.00%), and <i>Acrocalanus gracilis</i> (of 3.93%). A cluster analysis showed that the copepod communities of northeastern Taiwan fluctuated with season during the study period.  <i>Calanus sinicus</i> showed a significant negative correlation with seawater temperature (<i>r</i> = -0.434, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and was abundant during the period when the China Coastal Current intruded into northeastern Taiwan, indicating that it is a temperate species. In contrast, the abundances of 7 copepod species (<i>Acr. monachus, T. discaudata, Macrosetella gracilis, Corycaeus (Corycaeus) speciosus, Cor. (Farranula) concinna, Oncaea media</i>, and <i>Copilia mirabilis</i>) showed significant positive correlations with seawater temperature, indicating that they are subtropical and tropical species. Copepod species, the community structure, and assemblages were distinguished by seasonality based on seawater temperature. Results suggest that the planktonic copepod communities in these 2 bays of northeastern Taiwan are primarily influenced by water temperatures, with seasonal succession determined by ingress of the China Coastal Current and Kuroshio Branch Current.","Chou, C.; Tseng, L.-C.; Ou, C.-H.; Chen, Q.-C.; Hwang, J.-S.",WOS:000208855600014,"Chen, Qing-chao, Q.-C.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Copepod, Habitat diversity, East China Sea, China Coastal Current, Kuroshio Branch Current",Journal article,,,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",Taiwan,Copepod; Habitat diversity; East China Sea; China Coastal Current; Kuroshio Branch Current,EAST CHINA SEA; KUROSHIO BRANCH CURRENT; MARINE OUTFALL AREA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; COASTAL WATERS; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; CALANOID COPEPODS; ASSEMBLAGES; MESOZOOPLANKTON; ZOOPLANKTON,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

Molluscs are soft-bodied multi-cellular animals which secrete a hard calcareous shell for their protection. Each shell pattern is very specific to the particular species that synthesizes it. Therefore, there are shells of different shapes, colours, sizes, sculptures and ornamentation, which is typical of the molluscan species that produce them. The identification of shells is therefore, with reference to the molluscan species, which produce them. The type of shell each molluscan species produces helps in determining presence of that particular species in the marine environment and thus helps build a database of molluscs of that region. This chapter provides brief information on phylum Mollusca, different classes of the phylum, structure and description of molluscan shells, and salient features of shells of different species that are found in Goa.

This requires biological information on functional and structural species traits such as feeding ecology, body size, reproduction, life history, etc.To accommodate this need, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) (WoRMS Editorial Board 2017) is expanding its content with trait information (Costello et al. 2015), subdivided into 3 main categories: (1) taxonomy related traits, e.g. paraphyletic groups, (2) biological and ecological traits-specific characteristics of a taxon, e.g. body size or feeding type and (3) human defined traits, e.g. the legal protection status of species, whether a species is introduced, harmful, or used as an ecological indicator.Initially, priority was given to the inclusion of traits that could be applied to the majority of marine taxa and where the information was easily available. The main driver for this approach was that the inclusion of these traits should result in new research, which in turn would drive improvements in the quality and quantity of trait information. Pilot projects were carried out for different species groups, allowing a thorough documentation of a selection of traits. In parallel, a standard vocabulary was put together (http://www.marinespecies.org/traits/wiki/), based on already existing resources to cover all marine life. All documented traits needed to be compliant with this vocabulary, in order to make the data as widely useable as possible, across groups. Defining a trait across all marine life is not trivial, as scientists can use terms in a different way between groups. This stresses the importance for users to realize these differences in terminology, before they analyse a trait across all taxa.Some traits were thought to be quite straightforward to document, although practice proved otherwise. Such a trait is body size, where the aim was to document the numerical value of the ‘maximum body size in length’. In reality, a lot of variation is possible (e.g. for fish: fork length versus standard length) and maximum size is not always considered relevant from an ecological point of view. On the other hand, documenting numerical body size for each marine species is quite time consuming. Therefore, a complementary size trait will be documented, indicating whether taxa are considered as micro, meio, macro or mega.Whereas the initial approach was to complete the register for each tackled trait relevant for all marine species, we now complement this by (1) documenting several traits within a specific group, regardless whether this trait is also present in other taxon groups, and (2) documenting one specific trait, covering a variety – but not all – taxonomic groups, e.g. the composition of the skeleton for calcareous animals.Where possible, we aim to document a trait on a higher taxonomic level to allow the work to progress more rapidly. As the database allows top-down inheritance of traits, exceptions can easily be documented. In addition, collaborations are sought with already running initiatives such as Encyclopedia of Life.Very soon, all the documented traits will be searchable through the Marine Species Traits Portal. The human-defined traits are already accessible through the EMODnet Biology Portal (http://www.emodnet-biology.eu/toolbox), in combination with distribution information from the European Ocean Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS; www.eurobis.org; Vandepitte et al. 2011; Vandepitte et al. 2015) and taxonomy from WoRMS (www.marinespecies.org).

GoMexSI: using open platforms such as Github, Wordpress, and GloBI to manage, and share species interaction data . <i>Proceedings of TDWG 1</i>: e20325. <a href=""https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20325"" target=""_blank"">https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20325</a>","Biodiversity data and databases are usually taxonomic specific (e.g. HerpNet, FishNet2, etc.), although there are cases of regional, non-taxa specific, biodiversity databases. And some biodiversity databases are inclined toward a functional category, such as invasive species. While it is critical to know of the existence and taxonomy of the many biological species of the world, a logical next step is to catalogue the linkages, or interactions, between and amongst the species. These types of data occur in an ecosystem context, culling a subset of many species from many taxa to form the species assemblages and communities and the resulting interactions between them that make up the species interaction network.    Toward this end the Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI) database, which is an application of GloBI, is endeavoring to assemble, extract, upload, and serve all of the recorded species interaction data for the Gulf of Mexico. To do this we are dependent on the interoperability of various biodiversity databases such as EOL (Encyclopedia of Life), NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species), etc to provide name resolution for detection of invalid species names.  Using these data, GoMexSI takes advantage of the existing infrastructure of GloBI to integrate, link, and disseminate these data using various formats and methods. In addition, the relationship with GloBI negates the need to hire informatics staff, thus reducing costs. Data from GoMexSI is shared with scientists, and educators through GoMexSI’s Wordpress based webpage.    While GloBI is solely dependent on contributed datasets from scientists willing to share their data, GoMexSI expends a lot of effort harvesting species interaction data from published and unpublished resources, although contributed databases and datasets are accepted. The data extraction and editing process is very time consuming and costly. And funding sources for data extraction and editing are limited, making it difficult to maintain the effort.    Much of the data in GoMexSI comes from theses and dissertations (25% of references), while other sources include peer reviewed literature, government technical reports, and conference proceedings. The GoMexSI project has focused on cataloguing predator/prey interactions of the Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes, but recently began adding predator/prey interaction data on marine mammals, sea and shore birds, sea turtles, molluscs, and crustaceans to the database.    Much time and effort has been devoted to developing standards for biodiversity data in order to record these data in a consistent way (i.e. Darwin Core).  One of the key goals of the GoMexSI project from the outset has been to provide data standards for species interaction data where none existed previously. As we continue to work through the predator/prey interaction data of different taxa we are constantly confronted with new problems and issues in recording the data in a standard way. These include the description of predator and prey life history stages, description of prey parts, methods of length measurements, conversion of common names to scientific names, designation of locations, basis of prey identification, diet analysis methods, and others.    Currently GoMexSI has 89,209 lines of data representing 2,146 unique interactor, gleaned from 172 references. Future plans for GoMexSI call for the addition of host/parasite, commensal, amensal, and mutualistic interaction data. In addition, we plan to include stable isotope data for Gulf species, as they serve as an integrated record of past interactions. We have shared our data collection methods and spreadsheets with the US Marine Mammal Commission in their effort to create a diet database for marine mammals. We are currently assisting Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR) in La Paz Mexico to construct a species interaction database similar to GoMexSI for the Baja California (Gulf of California).","Simons, J.; Poelen, J.",,"Simons, James, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20325,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Database, Gulf of Mexico, Species interactions, GoMexSI, GloBI, open platforms",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of identified sequences in the reference databases affects the precision of identification. This paper compares the identification of marine nematode OTUs using alignment-based, tree-based and phylogeny-based approaches. Because the nematode reference dataset is limited in its taxonomic scope, OTUs can only be assigned to higher taxonomic categories, families.

The native range of <i>C. brunnea</i> seems to extend from British Columbia to the Galapagos, Ecuador. Our discovery indicates that this is the first record of <i>C. brunnea</i> across the East Atlantic and the first record of a species in this genus in the north-eastern Atlantic. The fouling nature of <i>Celleporaria brunnea</i> may have facilitated its spread to the western Pacific, the Mediterranean and now the eastern Atlantic from the Americas.","Canning-Clode, J.; Souto, J.; McCann, L.",,"Canning-Clode, João, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s1755267213000821,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, less than one fifth of the extant species are known to science, and among those only a minuscule proportion was described in any biological detail. This huge gap in our knowledge of biodiversity is in deep contrast with the extraordinary level of scientific and technological development that modern society has reached. How can we take advantage of the technology currently available to detect the putative high rates of biodiversity loss? How can we efficiently manage our ecosystems and biological communities if we do not even have a comprehensive inventory of biodiversity to start with?The Barcode of Life Initiative (BOLI) aims to contribute to resolve these questions by building a new system for species identification using DNA sequences from standardized regions of the genome—DNA barcodes. Once fully implemented, this novel system will greatly facilitate the access to taxonomic knowledge globally and revolutionize our ability to rapidly and rigorously identify life forms in a multitude of scenarios.We anticipate major contributions of DNA barcodes for biodiversity research when integrated with other ongoing technological, organizational and conceptual developments. This can be illustrated by the growing capacity to monitor biodiversity, which has lead to the recognition of cryptic species, their prevalence and distribution patterns. The coupling of DNA barcoding with next generation sequencing will enable to capture the structure and dynamics of complex communities with unprecedented degree of detail. This can catalyze the rate of species discovery globally and contribute to improve the way in which we conserve biodiversity.","Costa, F.O.; Antunes, P.M.",,"Antunes, Pedro, P.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-94-007-1321-5_4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Millions of marine fishes and invertebrates are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, and a handful of other countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database (https://www.aquariumtradedata.org/). This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2,300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1,800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8.2, 7.3, and 6.9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4.2, 3.7, and 3.6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60% of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9.3, 10.8, and 11.2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <i>Pterapogon kauderni</i>, and orange clownfish, <i>Amphiprion ocellaris / percula</i>) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing.

In order to assess the overall diversity of the Mediterranean cave biota, an overview of 307 studies was combined with data obtained from previously unexplored marine caves of the Aegean Sea. A total of 2167 taxa were recorded from 350 caves in 15 countries. Our analyses showed that research has mainly taken place in semi-submerged and shallow caves from the northern Mediterranean. Species richness varied among areas, reflecting variability in research effort and in the number of caves, which are more abundant on the rocky coasts of the northern basin. The Tyrrhenian Sea (822 taxa), Ionian Sea (696), and French coasts (650) presented the highest species richness and research effort. The biodiversity overview revealed that marine caves harbour a considerable proportion of the total Mediterranean fauna for particular phyla, especially for brachiopods, bryozoans and sponges. However, gaps of knowledge emerged regarding certain areas, groups of biota, assemblages, and cave types.

Over the last several years, numerous experimental manipulations of species richness have been performed, yet existing quantitative syntheses have focused on a just a subset of processes measured in experiments and, as such, have not summarized the full data available from marine systems. Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 110 marine experiments from 42 studies that manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes).    Our results show that, generally, mixtures of species tend to enhance levels of ecosystem function relative to the average component species in monoculture, but have no effect or a negative effect on functioning relative to the ‘highest- performing’ species. These results are largely consistent with those from other syntheses, and extend conclusions to ecological functions that are commonly measured in the marine realm (e.g. nutrient release from sediment bioturbation). For experiments that manipulated three or more levels of richness, we attempted to discern the functional form of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. We found that, for response variables related to consumption, a power-function best described the relationship, which is also consistent with previous findings. However, we identified a linear relationship between richness and production. Combined, our results suggest that changes in the number of species will, on average, tend to alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We outline several research frontiers that will allow us to more fully understand how, why, and when diversity may drive the functioning of marine ecosystems.","Gamfeldt, L.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Byrnes, J.E.K.; Cardinale, B.J.; Duffy, J.E.; Griffin, J.N.",WOS:000350462700002,"Gamfeldt, Lars, L.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/oik.01549,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Box 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Sweden,,PREDATOR DIVERSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; CONSUMER DIVERSITY; GRAZER DIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; PLANT DIVERSITY; EGG-PRODUCTION; FOOD,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Gothenburg,,Sweden,,University,Science

Species composition of the free living multicellular invertebrate animals (Metazoa: Invertebrata) from the Bulgarian sector of the Black Sea and the coastal brackish basins. <i>Hist. Nat. Bulg. 21</i>: 49-168","A total of 19 types, 39 classes, 123 orders, 470 families and 1537 species are known from the Bulgarian Black Sea. They include 1054 species (68.6%) of marine and marine-brackish forms and 508 species (33.0%) of freshwater-brackish, freshwater and terrestrial forms, connected with water. Five types (Nematoda, Rotifera, Annelida, Arthropoda and Mollusca) have a high species richness (over 100 species). Of these, the richest in species are Arthropoda (802 species – 52.2%), Annelida (173 species – 11.2%) and Mollusca (152 species – 9.9%). The remaining 14 types include from 1 to 38 species. There are some well-studied regions (over 200 species recorded): first, the vicinity of Varna (601 species), where investigations continue for more than 100 years. The aquatory of the towns Nesebar, Pomorie, Burgas and Sozopol (220 to 274 species) and the region of Cape Kaliakra (230 species) are well-studied. Of the coastal basins moststudied are the lakes Durankulak, Ezerets-Shabla, Beloslav, Varna, Pomorie, Atanasovsko, Burgas, Mandra and the firth of Ropotamo River (up to 100 species known). The vertical distribution has been analyzed for 800 species (75.9%) – marine and marine-brackish forms. The great number of species is found from 0 to 25 m on sand (396 species) and rocky (257 species) bottom. The groups of stenohypo- (52 species – 6.5%), stenoepi- (465 species – 58.1%), meso- (115 species – 14.4%) and eurybathic forms (168 species – 21.0%) are represented. The marine and marine-brackish species are divided into 162 zoogeographical categories, combined into 4 main groups and 16 subgroups. The main portion of the Black Sea fauna has an Atlantic-Mediterranean origin and represents the impoverished Atlantic-Mediterranean fauna (740 species – 70.2%). Cosmopolitan, Atlantic-Indian, Atlantic-Pacific, endemic and Caspian relict forms are represented. The benthic (115 species – 97.5%) and marine (114 species – 96.6%) forms of the Black Sea endemics (118 species – 11.2%) predominate. The brackish endemics (11 species – 9.3%) most often are Caspian relicts. The main portions of the Caspian relicts (41 species – 3.9%) are benthic brackish forms (38 species – 92.7%). The freshwaterbrackish, freshwater and terrestrial forms, connected with water, are divided into 80 zoogeographical categories, combined into 2 groups and 5 subgroups. Typical for the coast is the prevalence of the species, distributed in Palaearctic and beyond it (296 species – 58.3%). Species, distributed only in Palaearctic but in more than one subregion (79 species – 15.5%) and species, distributed within one Palaearctic subregion (126 species – 24.8%) are represented – Eurosiberian (55 species – 10.8%) and Mediterranean (71 species – 13.9%). A short characteristic of the planktonic and benthic cenoses is done and some coastal basins are scrutinized. An attention is paid to the invasive immigrants that changed the Black Sea communities during the last 60 years.

These large biogeographic units were divided into five geographical regions to provide regional estimates of observed and predicted taxon richness. We did not detect a strong regional difference in benthic community characteristics, observing only a lower richness in the Amundsen Gulf region than in the neighboring Beaufort Sea region. The Amundsen Gulf region had the highest turnover (beta) diversity, coincident with high environmental heterogeneity. The strong and distinctive presence in the Beaufort Sea region of <i>Saduria</i> spp., a euryhaline isopod, demonstrated the particular influence of the Mackenzie River on the community composition of that region.

Several studies have typified species of echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks as the most important herbivores and carnivores of intertidal assemblages. Unfortunately, little is known about the diet and behavior of many consumers, making difficult addressing key issues related to the importance of omnivory, intra- and inter-specific competition, or individual specialization. The goal of this paper is to fill some gaps in the available information and provide researchers with an exhaustive dietary analysis and relevant ecological descriptors for a suite of 30 consumer species distributed along the southeastern Pacific coast. Our data integrate information collected through seasonal samplings conducted between 2004 and 2007 at 4 localities distributed over 1,000 km of coast in northern Chile. Based on laboratory and field work analysis, we present: (a) a consumer-resource matrix obtained from high-resolution analyses of gut contents of 6,377 individuals, including 222 prey items (80% identified at species or genus level); (b) estimates of the density, body size (length and weight), diet width (at individual and species levels), and within-individual diversity of consumer species; (c) an nMDS ordination of the compositional similarity of consumers' diets, and information on the relative importance and occurrence frequency of the most common preys of each consumer. Based on the high frequency of omnivory and the high diet overlap among consumers, we discuss their potential for competition and the role of individual specialization in shaping their generalist character, highlighting the need to reappraise their behavior and ecological effects in the intertidal community.","Camus, P.A.; Arancibia, P.A.; Ávila-Thieme, M.I.",WOS:000329434700003,"Arancibia, Paulina, P.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.4067/S0718-19572013000300003,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Diet; niche width; individual specialization; omnivory; body size.,Journal article,,,"Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Casilla 297, Concepcion, Chile.",Chile,Diet; niche width; individual specialization; omnivory; body size,ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; DIETARY PATTERNS; NORTHERN CHILE; GUT CONTENTS; FOOD WEBS; BODY-SIZE; PREDATION; POPULATION,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción - Faculty of Sciences - Department of Ecology,x,Chile,,University,Science

A comparative SEM analysis did not outline significant differences among shells with greatly different colour patterns, thus justifying their belonging to a single specific entity. The survey of the material of <i>J. baudoni</i> did not show a strict correspondence between Corse and Sardinian shell colour morphs and their geographical distribution, not allowing to clearly state trends and relationships among island populations. On the contrary the colour pattern of the continental shells of <i>J. baudoni</i> seems to be constant and different from the ones of the island shells, indicating a well separated colour morph. This study confirmed that the distribution of <i>J. baudoni</i> is limited to the north-western Mediterranean Sea, with its eastern range widened to the La Maddalena Archipelago (Sardinia).

The Glorieuses Archipelago forms part of the Eparses Islands, or the French scattered islands in the Mozambique Channel (Western Indian Ocean). Inventories of several taxa, including the holothurians (Echinodermata), were carried out in December 2012 as part of the BIORECIE (Biodiversity, Resources and Conservation of Eparses Islands) programme. Specimens were collected and photographed on the reef slopes of the island at ten sites down to 20 m and the reef flats at twelve sites. Given the worldwide overexploitation of holothurians, it is important to know their present diversity and distribution in such remote areas. The Holothuria comprised 20 species: 10 species were collected on the slopes and 15 on the reef flats. Despite the limited number of sites surveyed, the occurrence of the different species allowed their categorisation as common, uncommon or rare. The commercial species, <i>Holothuria nobilis, Bohadschia atra</i> and <i>B. subrubra</i>, were common. Comparisons at local and regional scales using the same methodology showed that holothurian diversity in Glorieuses is high, but already occurring illegal fisheries are a serious concern.","Conand, C.; Mulochau, T.; Chabanet, P.",,"Conand, Chantal, C.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Holothuria, Glorieuses Islands, Western Indian Ocean, occurrence, diversity, coral reefs",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMBI is an extensively used index in Europe, including Norway. Species sensitivity assignments of 516 taxa common to NSI and AMBI were compared. Significant discrepancies were revealed in the assignments. The performance of NSI and AMBI along different types of pressure gradients was compared. In most cases, NSI showed a better correlation with different pressures compared to AMBI. This was most pronounced in the fjords and coastal areas in Norway, less so at offshore sites in the North Sea. As a common set of taxa was used, differences in the correlations with pressures were entirely caused by different sensitivities assigned to the same taxa by NSI and AMBI. The results indicate that the Norwegian classification system will be improved by replacing AMBI with NSI as sensitivity component in assessing ecological status in coastal waters.

The scale similarity is examined by using a taxonomic metrics based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and a related index of similarity.2 - Data were collected monthly during one year in four dominant habitat types, which were classified on the basis of main physiognomic traits (type of vegetation and anthropogenic impact). Three of the selected habitats were natural (macroalgal beds, bare sediment and Phragmitetum) and one anthropogenically modified (the licensed area for Manila clam farming). Each habitat was sampled in a variable number of stations representative of specific microhabitats, with three replicates each.3 - Of the 47 taxa identified, only few species were found exclusively in one habitat type, with low densities. No taxon was dominant in all the considered habitats.4 - The results show that, in spite of the large overlapping of species, the spatio-temporal dissimilarity within each habitat type was higher than expected on the basis of the common physiognomic traits. This suggests that local factors (mainly hydrodynamism, quality and quantity of vegetal matter) play a significant role in determining the structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages.5 - The dissimilarity between habitats was significant and maintained all over the seasonal progression, indicating that the macroinvertebrate assemblages were steadily different. Each habitat allowed some specific taxa to maintain a significant population size, which is a prerequisite for preserving biodiversity.6 - The variety of vegetation types and hydrodynamic conditions in the lagoon emerges as crucial for sustaining biodiversity and capacity to recover from disturbances.","Ludovisi, A.; Castaldelli, G.; Fano, E.A.",,"Ludovisi, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1285/i1825229Xv7n2p233,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,biodiversity; macrozoobenthos; patchiness; coastal lagoons; Mediterranean Eco-region,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Natural Heritage Department of the MNHN (Service du Patrimoine Naturel) manages France’s national inventory of natural heritage (Inventaire National du Patrimoine Naturel, INPN) and all related databases. This information can be accessed by managers in order, for example, to tailor specific conservation measures to relevant habitats or species in a geographical area. Diversity and distribution data are collected for all taxonomic groups associated with coral reefs, in close collaboration with taxonomic experts and local overseas IFRECOR committees. Raw data are then processed, verified and integrated, and taxonomic reference lists by geographic are generated. Finally, the MNHN diffuses this information via the INPN website (http://inpn.mnhn.fr).

The genus <i>Caligus</i> Müller, 1785 (Copepoda: Siphonostomatoida): two new species from reef associated fishes in New Caledonia, and some nomenclatural problems resolved. <i>Zootaxa 3534(3534)</i>: 21-39","<i>Caligus</i> <i>praecinctorius</i> sp. nov. is described on the basis of females taken from the gills of <i>Gymnocranius</i> <i>grandoculis</i> Valenciennes, 1830, <i>G.</i> <i>euanus</i> (Günther, 1879) and <i>Epinephelus</i> <i>fasciatus</i> (Forsskål, 1775), all caught in New Caledonia. The new species is characterised by having the posteromedian lobe of the cephalothorax completely covering the fourth pedigerous somite in dorsal view, and by the genital complex being 2.7 times wider than long. A second new species, <i>C.</i> <i>macoloricola</i> sp. nov., is described based on material from the gills of <i>Macolor</i> <i>niger</i> (Forsskål, 1775). It is distinguished by the combination of a 3-segmented leg 4 with 4 spines on the distal segment, a vestigial post-antennal process, and the configuration of the setal elements on the exopod of leg 1. The status of a number of other <i>Caligus</i> species is reviewed. It is proposed to treat <i>C.</i> <i>angustatus</i> Krøyer, 1863 as a junior subjective synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>gurnardi</i> Krøyer, 1863, <i>C.</i> <i>dactylus</i> Ho, Lin & Chang, 2007 as a junior subjective synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>dactylopteni</i> Uma Devi & Shyamasundari, 1981, and <i>C.</i> <i>kirtioides</i> Ho & Lin, 2004 as a junior subjective synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>jawahari</i> Hameed & Adamkutty, 1985. <i>Caligus</i> <i>bifurcatus</i> Pearse, 1952 is recognised as a junior subjective synonym of <i>Tuxophorus</i> <i>caligodes</i> Wilson, 1908. <i>Caligus</i> <i>cristatus</i> Gould, 1841 is here treated as a species inquirendum in the pandarid genus <i>Dinemoura</i> Latreille, 1829. <i>Caligus</i> <i>elevatus</i> Kirtisinghe, 1964 is discovered to be an incorrect subsequent spelling of <i>C.</i> <i>clavatus</i> Kirtisinghe, 1964. <i>Caligus</i> <i>gayi</i> Nicolet, 1849 is here treated as a species inquirendum. It is proposed to treat <i>C.</i> <i>oligoplitisi</i> Carvalho, 1956, <i>C.</i> <i>validus</i> Pearse, 1952 and <i>C.</i> <i>mercatoris</i> Capart, 1941 as junior subjective synonyms of <i>C.</i> <i>robustus</i> Bassett-Smith, 1898 and a list of known hosts of this species is presented. <i>Caligus</i> <i>pterois</i> Kurian, 1949 has priority over <i>Caligus</i> <i>russellii</i> Kurien, 1950, which is here treated as a junior objective synonym, since the two descriptions were based on the same material. We reject Cressey’s (1991) proposal to treat <i>C.</i> <i>tenax</i> Heller, 1865 as a synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>chorinemi</i> Krøyer, 1863 and we retain <i>C.</i> <i>tenax</i> as a valid species. We propose to treat <i>C.</i> <i>spinosurculus</i> Pearse, 1951 as a junior subjective synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>tenax.</i> We propose to treat <i>C.</i> <i>multispinosus</i> Shen, 1957 as a junior subjective synonym of <i>C.</i> <i>stromatei</i> Krøyer, 1863. We note that <i>Caligus</i> <i>trichiuri</i> Krøyer, 1863 is the oldest available name for the taxon <i>Metacaligus</i> <i>uruguayensis</i> Thomsen, 1949.

Planktonic foraminifers are badly preserved or absent through the section because of dissolution. The presence of displaced specimens of Nephrolepidina praemarginata, which was the object of a biometrical analysis for the embryonic apparatus, dates the studied section at least late Rupelian. In the silty marl layers deep water agglutinated foraminifers (DWAF) and bathyal hyaline foraminifers are frequent; 36 agglutinated and 26 hyaline species of benthic foraminifers, some of which in open nomenclature, were identified. Upsection the specific diversity tends to decrease, whereas the quartz supply increases and assemblages become exclusively constituted by agglutinated DWAF with predominant tubular suspension feeding taxa. In three samples few, badly preserved and displaced gastropods belonging to Architectonicidae, Ampullinidae, Trochidae, Cerithiopsidae, Rissoidae and Pyramidellidae were recognized. The Gratteri Formation deposited during the late Rupelian in a basin periodically affected by gravitative and turbiditic flows, which carried basinward coeval shallow-water larger foraminifers and gastropods. The dissolution of the most calcareous taxa is imputed to the fluctuations and local rise of the calcite compensation depth (CCD) or, more likely, to reducing conditions in bottom sediments.","Benedetti, A.; D'Amico, C.",WOS:000301322800005,"Benedetti, Andrea, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3301/IJG.2011.23,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Foraminifers, molluscs, biometry, Nephrolepidina, Gratteri Formation, Sicily",Journal article,,,"Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",Italy,Foraminifers; molluscs; biometry; Nephrolepidina; Gratteri Formation; Sicily,PATTERNS; LEPIDOCYCLINA; OCEAN; WATER; FLUX,"Geology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,Sapienza University of Rome - Department of Earth Sciences,x,Italy,,University,Science

The influence of gradients in water depth, hydrodynamic energy and sediment properties are less well known. We studied how these variables influence the distribution of subtidal macrofauna in the polyhaline zone of a temperate estuary (Westerschelde, SW Netherlands). Macrofauna density, biomass and species richness, combined in a so-called ecological richness, decreased with current velocities and median grain-size and increased with organic carbon of the sediment, in total explaining 39% of the variation. The macrofauna community composition was less well explained by the three environmental variables (approx. 12e15% in total, with current velocity explaining approx. 8%). Salinity, water depth and distance to the intertidal zone had a very limited effect on both ecological richness and the macrofauna community. The proportion of (surface) deposit feeders (including opportunistic species), decreased relative to that of omnivores and carnivores with increasing current velocity and sediment grain-size. In parallel, the proportion of burrowing sessile benthic species decreased relative to that of mobile benthic species that are able to swim. Correspondingly, spatial variations in hydrodynamics yielded distinct hotspots and coldspots in ecological richness. The findings highlight the importance of local hydrodynamic conditions for estuarine restoration and conservation. The study provides a tool based on a hydrodynamic model to assess and predict ecological richness in estuaries.","van der Wal, D.; Lambert, G.I.; Ysebaert, T.; Plancke, Y.; Herman, P.M.J.",WOS:000412252800008,"Lambert, G.I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2017.08.012,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Westerschelde,,"Flow, ""Hydrodynamics""",,Macrozoobenthos; Estuarine gradients; Functional traits,Journal article,,,"Univ Utrecht, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Macrozoobenthos; Estuarine gradients; Functional traits; Hydrodynamics; Flow; Westerschelde,SCALE SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BENTHIC MACROFAUNA; FEEDING GUILD; GRADIENT; QUALITY; REGRESSION; DISPOSAL; HOTSPOTS; SHIFTS; MODEL,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,,,,,,

The studied succession consists of two distinct layers. The lower layer consists of white limestone (4 m thick) of Late Pleistocene age, while the upper layer consists of shell-rich calcareous clay (2 m thick) and belongs to the last interglacial marine isotope stage 5e (MIS 5e). Its lithology was correlated with a nearby temporarily exposed 3-m succession, indicating that the deposition of the MIS 5e was not continuous, as indicated by the occurrence of a 0.4-m-thick weathered layer between the lower white limestone and upper calcareous clay. The studied 6-m succession yielded a very rich gastropod fauna with 90 species belonging to 4 subclasses, 5 orders, 16 superfamilies, 33 families and 64 genera. The clayey layer showed higher species richness (65 species) than the limestone layer (18 species), indicating a rapid change in the coral reef environment during the deposition of the interval of MIS 5e. It is assumed that, after the weathering interval, the sea level could not rebound to the same level as it was during the deposition of the white limestone, leading to deposition of calcareous clay in a shallow platform or embayment, allowing proliferation of gastropod species. Littorinimorpha and Neogastropoda species represent about 75% of the total recorded gastropod taxa, whereas Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda represent only 25% of the total recorded taxa.

This study investigates the long-term community dynamics of damage from Typhoon 17 (Jelawat) in 2012 on the coral community of the upper mesophotic Ryugu Reef in Okinawa, Japan. A shift from foliose to bushy coral morphologies between December 2012 and August 2015 was documented, especially on the area of the reef that was previously recorded to be poor in scleractinian genera diversity and dominated by foliose corals. Comparatively, an area with higher diversity of scleractinian coral genera was observed to be less affected by typhoon damage with more stable community structure due to less change in dominant coral morphologies. Despite some changes in the composition of dominant genera, the generally high coverage of the mesophotic coral community is facilitating the recovery of Ryugu Reef after typhoon damage.","White, K.N.; Weinstein, D.K.; Ohara, T.; Denis, V.; Montenegro, J.; Reimer, J.D.",WOS:000411947500001,"Montenegro, Javier, J.","Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.",https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3573,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Mesophotic, Succession, Coral reef, Pachyseris, Japan, Typhoon recovery, Shifting communities",Journal article,,,"Univ Tampa, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.",USA,Mesophotic; Succession; Coral reef; Pachyseris; Japan; Typhoon recovery; Shifting communities,CNIDARIA ANTHOZOA SCLERACTINIA; CARIBBEAN CORAL-REEFS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SPECIES TRAITS; PHASE-SHIFTS; RECOVERY; GROWTH; DISTURBANCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

This paper reviews and discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning algorithms to extract information from systematic literature. NLP algorithms have been used for decades, but require special development for application in the biological realm due to the special nature of the language. Many tools exist for biological information extraction (cellular processes, taxonomic names, and morphological characters), but none have been applied life wide and most still require testing and development. Progress has been made in developing algorithms for automated annotation of taxonomic text, identification of taxonomic names in text, and extraction of morphological character information from taxonomic descriptions.

The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the taxonomic structure of zoopsammon in Estonian waters. The study is based on samples collected from four lakes across Estonia and from three sandy beaches on the Estonian coast of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, in 2008-2014. Animals from 12 phyla were found, of which the majority of rotifers and testate amoebae were identified to species level. A total of 156 taxa were determined, including 84 rotifer species and 39 testate amoebae species. In addition to the 46 new taxa for the Estonian fauna already registered in our previous works, the present study reports further 11 new rotifer, 19 testate amoebae, and 6 nematode taxa. The psammic communities in lake beaches had higher species richness than in coastal beaches, and the communities were more similar in coastal beaches than in lake beaches. The mesotrophic Lake Saadjärv had the highest taxon richness with 80 taxa from 10 phyla. Similarly, the number of testate amoebae species was higher in lake beaches than in coastal beaches. The number of taxa, especially the number of rotifer species, was lower in sampling sites with an elevated trophic state and/or human population density. The number of testate amoebae species was the highest in the hypertrophic Lake Verevi.

Below a threshold, the animals may produce fewer and larger germ cells, giving rise to fewer and larger eggs and large lecithotrophic embryos with large paucispiral protoconch I, while above that threshold, more and smaller germ cells leading to smaller eggs and to planktotrophic larvae with small protoconch I and large multispiral protoconch II.

Each data source follows its own classification which can be inconsistent with classifications from other sources. Even with a reference classification e.g. the GBIF Backbone taxonomy, a comprehensive method to compare classifications in the data aggregation is essential, especially for non-expert users. New information: A Java application was developed to compare multiple taxonomies graphically using classification data acquired from GBIF’s ChecklistBank via the GBIF Species API. It uses a table to display taxonomies where each column represents a taxonomy under comparison, with an aligner column to organise taxa by name. Each cell contains the name of a taxon if the classification in that column contains the name. Each column also has a cell showing the hierarchy of the taxonomy by a folder metaphor where taxa are aligned and synchronised in the aligner column. A set of those comparative tables shows taxa categorised by relationship between taxonomies. The result set is also available as tables in an Excel format file.","Ytow, N.",WOS:000449618200134,"Ytow, Nozomi, N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.4.e9787,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,"Multiple hierarchies, Data visualization, Tree comparison, GBIF API Go to: Introduction",Data paper,,,"Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",Japan,Multiple hierarchies; Data visualization; Tree comparison; GBIF API,MODEL,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,University of Tsukuba - Faculty of Life and Environmental Science,x,Japan,,University,Science

Here, I review six software tools that spell-check taxon names in vegetation databases: (1) the Global Names Resolver, (2) the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera, (3) the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service and R packages (4) Plantminer, (5) Taxonstand and (6) tpl. In particular, I test their capacity to spell-check names across the taxonomic ranks and organism groups frequently encountered in vegetation data and challenge their ability to screen names from different geographic regions. Performance by software tools differed widely in these tests. Backed up by multiple reference lists, the Global Names Resolver emerged as the most versatile software tool. All software solutions currently suffer from some minor limitations, including an inability to spell-check names of hybrid taxa. Furthermore, some spelling mistakes, by their nature, cannot be resolved unambiguously. Given these limitations, taxon names should be spell-checked with software tools in a semi-automatic rather than an automatic way.","Wagner, V.",WOS:000389066400023,"Wagner, Viktoria, V.","Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/jvs.12432,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,Big data; Biodiversity informatics; Eco-informatics; Name matching; Orthographic errors; Software; Spell-check; Spelling; Taxon; Taxonomic database; Vegetation database,Journal article,,,"Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",Czech Republic,Big data; Biodiversity informatics; Eco-informatics; Name matching; Orthographic errors; Software; Spell-check; Spelling; Taxon; Taxonomic database; Vegetation database,PACKAGE,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,Masaryk University,,Czech Republic,,University,Science

Specific foraging strategies, however, may increase exposure to environmental contaminants that can alter the cost-benefit balance of consuming particular food items. The Lesser Black-backed Gull (<i>Larus fuscus</i>) is known to opportunistically feed on a wide range of marine and terrestrial prey that differ in contaminant load, such as mercury (Hg) that strongly biomagnifies through the aquatic food web. The hypothesis tested in this study were: i) a predominant use of marine prey by females during egg-formation and by both parents during chick rearing increases the exposure to Hg during embryonic development and chick growth, and ii) this affects parental investment in clutch volume, chick growth and body condition. Total Hg burden and isotopic signatures of carbon (δ<sp>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (δ<sup>15</sup>N) were determined for eggs, down feathers, and primary feathers of <i>L. fuscus</i> chicks collected at a coastal colony in Belgium. As expected, eggs and feathers of chicks from parents with a stable isotope signature that suggested a predominantly marine diet had higher levels of Hg. The use of marine resources by females during the egg-formation period positively correlated to maternal investment in egg size, though entailing the cost of increased Hg-concentrations which in turn negatively affected clutch volume. Furthermore, it is shown that the use of chick down feathers is a suitable matrix to non-lethally estimate Hg concentrations in eggs. Contrary to our expectations, no relationship between Hg exposure and chick growth or chick body condition was found, which may be due the low concentrations found. We conclude that currently Hg contamination does not constitute a risk for development and condition of <i>L. fuscus</i> offspring at the levels currently observed at the Belgian coast.","Santos, C.S.A.; Blondel, L.; Sotillo, A.; Müller, W.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Boeckx, P.; Soares, A.M.V.M.; Monteiro, M.S.; Loureiro, S.; de Neve, L.; Lens, L.",WOS:000406294900129,"Santos, Cátia, C.S.A.","Department of Biology, Terrestrial Ecology Unit, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.05.286,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,"Larus fuscus Linnaeus, 1758",Reproduction,,Foraging plasticity; Mercury exposure; Chick quality,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, Dept Biol, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Foraging plasticity; Mercury exposure; Larus fuscus; Reproduction; Chick quality,GULLS LARUS-FUSCUS; MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS; EGG COMPONENTS; ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; ADULT FEMALES; DIET; CARBON; SIZE; NESTLINGS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC) ,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

A multi-disciplinary approach was used, combining morphological characteristics such as colonial branching patterns, polyp structure, and sclerite form and arrangement, together with phylogenetic reconstructions using two mitochondrial gene regions (mtMutS and igr1–cox1). The genus <i>Anthothela</i>, with seven nominal species globally, is here divided into four genera, two of which are new. Three of the original species of <i>Anthothela</i> are validated (<i>A. grandiflora</i> Sars, 1856, <i>A. pacifica</i> Kükenthal, 1913 and <i>A. tropicalis</i> Bayer, 1961), Spongioderma (?) vickersi Benham, 1928 is reassigned to <i>Anthothela</i> and two new species, <i>A. aldersladei</i> and <i>A. quattriniae</i>, are described. <i>Anthothela argentea</i> Studer, 1894, <i>A. macrocalyx</i> (Nutting, 1911) and A. nuttingi Bayer, 1956 are reassigned to Victorgorgia López-González & Briand, 2002 and two new species of this genus, <i>V. eminens</i> and <i>V. nyahae</i> are described. A new family, Victorgorgiidae is described for Victorgorgia due to clear morphological and genetic differences from Anthothela, the type genus of Anthothelidae. A new genus, Williamsium (Anthothelidae), is described for <i>A. parviflora</i> Thomson, 1916 which is restricted to South African waters. A number of North Atlantic Ocean specimens that have traditionally been mistaken for <i>Anthothela grandiflora</i> were found to be synonymous with <i>Alcyonium grandiflorum</i> (Tixier-Durivault & d'Hondt, 1974) and a second new genus, <i>Lateothela</i> (Anthothelidae), is erected for these specimens based on morphological and molecular evidence that <i>Alcyonium grandiflorum</i> was incorrectly placed in the genus <i>Alcyonium</i> Linnaeus. There is good congruence between morphological characteristics and molecular data at a generic level but at a species level, the degree of congruence was inconclusive as morphological and genetic variation is very low. Anthothela and Lateothela n. gen. are found to be closely related to some nominal <i>Alcyonium</i> species, and the family Anthothelidae and subfamily Anthothelinae are shown to be paraphyletic.

These animals can colonize virtually any type of substratum, including other organisms and artificial structures. Associations between bryozoans and sponges are commonly reported in the literature, but there are few studies discussing the association between these two taxa in detail. Here we present data on the bryozoan community found on shallow-water sponges from Bahia coast, northeastern Brazil, including their taxonomic status, colony form and adaptative structures utilized by these bryozoans to grow on sponges. Twenty-one bryozoan species were found attached to the surface of sixteen species of sponges. Five new species of cheilostome bryozoans are described. A total of 105 colonies were studied and most of them are erect delicate branching (44 colonies) and encrusting patches (34 colonies). The majority of bryozoan colonies were attached to the surface of rugose-textured sponges (67 colonies; 61%). This suggests that bryozoans are more likely to settle on irregular and rough surfaces. Patches colonies were mainly attached to the portion of the sponge that was in contact with the seabed, and spot colonies were particularly found in spatial refuges, showing the preference of larvae to settle on shaded and less exposed substrata. Most erect bryozoans were attached to the lateral sponge surface, other colonies grew on the underside and few on the upper surface of the sponges. These colonies were attached either using anchoring rhizoids, rigid bases, or stolons. The bryozoan species and genera reported here are common in northeastern Brazil and considered generalists in terms of larval settlement requirements. The bryozoan-sponge association studied is considered a non-obligatory commensalism (inquilinism).","Almeida, A.C.S.; Souza, F.B.C.; Menegola, C.; Vieira, L.M.",WOS:000404958700003,"Almeida, Ana, A.C.S.","Univ Fed Pernambuco, Lab Estudos Bryozoa LAEBry, Dept Zool, Ctr Ciencias Biol, BR-50670810 Recife, PE, Brazil.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zootaxa.4290.2.3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Bryozoa, ""Cheilostomata"", ""Cyclostomata""","Commensalism, ""New species""",,Atlantic Ocean,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Bahia, Museu Zool, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",Brazil,Atlantic Ocean; Bryozoa; Cheilostomata; commensalism; Cyclostomata; new species,RIO-DE-JANEIRO; CHEILOSTOME BRYOZOANS; ENCRUSTING BRYOZOANS; INTERTIDAL BRYOZOA; ISLAND; PORIFERA; SOUTH; FAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES,Zoology,Zoology,Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE),,Brazil,,University,Science

Polychaetes were significant taxa at both sites in terms of density and biomass, and in addition crustacean density in NOW and bivalve density in LS were high. Facultative filter and surface deposit feeders were highly prevalent at both sites, suggesting feeding plasticity is a successful strategy for accessing different food sources. The macrofaunal δ<sup>13</sup>C signatures reflected the signatures of pelagic particulate organic matter at the sites, and an isotope mixing model confirmed phytoplankton as the main food source for most taxa and feeding guilds. The food web length in LS was longer than in NOW (3.2 vs. 2.8 trophic levels). This was attributed to a larger reliance on reworked organic matter by the benthic community in LS, whereas the high export fluxes at the highly productive NOW resulted in higher rates of selective consumption of fresh algal matter. Despite studies suggesting that loss of ice algae from consumer diets in the Arctic might have a negative impact on the benthos, this study suggests that Arctic macrobenthic communities thrive using phytoplankton as their main food source and should thus be able to cope or even benefit from predicted changes to patterns of primary production.","Mäkelä, A.; Witte, U.; Archambault, P.",WOS:000408544200009,"Mäkelä, Anni, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0183034,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Oceanlab, Newburgh, Aberdeen, Scotland.",Scotland,,FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; NORTHEAST WATER POLYNYA; MARGINAL ICE-ZONE; STABLE-ISOTOPE RATIOS; BEAUFORT SEA SHELF; BERING-SEA; BARENTS SEA; DEEP-SEA; DELTA-N-15 ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-MATTER,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Aberdeen - School of Biology Science - Oceanlab,x,,,,

Recently, ocean acidification from increases in anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> has been identified as an additional stressor, particularly to calcifying organisms like bivalves. These bivalves are common prey items for benthivorous predators such as Pacific walruses (<i>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</i>), bearded seals (<i>Erignathus barbatus</i>), and diving seaducks, such as Spectacled Eiders (<i>Somateria fischeri</i>). We investigated the effects of decreased pH and food availability on growth (% change in length and wet weight and allometric growth characterizations) and oxygen consumption (mg/L/hour) of three common Arctic bivalves, <i>Macoma calcarea, Astarte montagui</i>, and <i>Astarte borealis</i>. Two sets of experiments were run for seven and eleven weeks, exposing the bivalves to control (8.05 ± 0.02 and 8.19 ± 0.003, respectively) and acidified (7.76 ± 0.01 and 7.86 ± 0.01, respectively) pH treatments. Length, weight, and oxygen consumption were not significantly different among the varying treatments after the seven-week exposure and only one significant effect of decreased pH and one significant effect of decreased food availability were observed after the end of the eleven-week exposure. Specifically, shells of <i>A. borealis</i> displayed a decrease in length in response to decreased pH and <i>M. calcarea</i> showed a decrease in length in response to limited food. The negative effects of pH observed in the experiments on growth and oxygen consumption were small, suggesting that at least two of these species are generally resilient to decreasing pH.","Goethel, C.; Grebmeier, J.M.; Cooper, L.W.; Miller, T.J.",WOS:000413800300010,"Goethel, Christina, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.08.013,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Acidification, ""Benthos""",,Arctic; Chukchi Sea; infauna; mollusc; bivalve,Journal article,,,"Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",USA,Arctic; Chukchi Sea; Acidification; Benthos; Infauna; Mollusc; Bivalve,CALORIC CONTENT; METABOLIC-RATE; CHUKCHI SEA; CARBON; IMPACTS; CO2; TEMPERATURE; CALCIFICATION; COMMUNITY; SHELF,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Maryland,x,USA,,University,Science

This study examined the long-term changes in abundance, individual growth rates and shell shape characteristics of <i>Macoma balthica</i>, one of the dominant species in White Sea soft-bottom intertidal communities. To test the role of predators in changes in clam abundance, we examined the number of moonsnails <i>Amauropsis islandica. Macoma balthica</i> exhibited spatially synchronous population dynamics at six sites in Kandalaksha Bay, where densities of clams varied between 140 and 8500 ind. m−2 during the 21-year period of observations. Statistical modelling using generalized additive models (GAM) shows that a combination of mild winter and warm summer led to an increase in M. balthica density the following year. Predation by <i>A. islandica</i> had no impact on changes in <i>M. balthica</i> density. Growth rates of <i>M. balthica</i> were higher during a cool decade, but clams that lived in a warmer period were characterized by more globose shells. Our results suggest that the climate oscillations can be regarded as the key factor causing the shift in abundance of <i>M. balthica</i> in the White Sea during the last two decades via recruitment and survival.","Genelt-Yanovskiy, E.A.; Aristov, D.A.; Poloskin, A.V.; Nazarova, S.A.",WOS:000430473000002,"Genelt-Yanovskiy, Evgeny, E.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/s0025315417001473,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Amauropsis islandica, ""Limecola balthica"", ""Macoma balthica"", ""Naticidae""",Population dynamics,,White Sea; linear growth; predator-prey interactions; climate change,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, Marine Res Lab, Zool Inst, Univ Skaya Emb 1, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",Russia,Macoma balthica; Limecola balthica; White Sea; population dynamics; linear growth; Amauropsis islandica; Naticidae; predator-prey interactions; climate change,BIVALVE MACOMA-BALTHICA; LONG-TERM DYNAMICS; WADDEN SEA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MYTILUS-EDULIS; GROWTH-RATE; FOULING COMMUNITIES; RECRUITMENT SUCCESS; SIZE STRUCTURE; MYA-ARENARIA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,
