These reefs are under threat due to many anthropogenic stressors including pollution, sedimentation, overfishing, sea surface warming and habitat destruction. Ocean acidification interacts with these factors to exacerbate stress on coral reefs. Effective solutions in tackling the impact of ocean acidification require a thorough understanding of the current adaptive capacity of each nation to deal with the consequences. Here, we aim to help the decision-making process for policy makers in dealing with these future challenges at the regional and national levels. We recommend that a series of evaluations be made to understand the current status of each nation in this region in dealing with ocean acidification impacts by assessing the climate policy, education, policy coherence, related research activities, adaptive capacity of reef-dependent economic sectors and local management. Indonesia and Thailand, are selected as case studies. We also highlight general recommendations on mitigation and adaptation to ocean acidification impacts on coral reefs and propose well-designed research program would be necessary for developing a more targeted policy agenda in this region.","Lam, V.W.Y.; Chavanich, S.; Djoundourian, S.; Dupont, S.; Gaill, F.; Holzer, G.; Isensee, K.; Katua, S.; Mars, F.; Metian, M.; Hall-Spencer, J.M.",WOS:000469847300006,"Djoundourian, Salpie, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100560,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Changing Ocean Res Unit, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",Canada,,MARINE; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; SCALE; PH; BIODIVERSITY; MACROALGAE; TRIANGLE; SEA,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of British Columbia,x,Canada,,University,Science

The time-series datasets derived from the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) Ocean Biogeochemical Model and retrieved via the Giovanni Portal were analysed statistically with well-known methods including Pearson’s correlation coefficient, ordinary least square regression (OLR), Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The data were analysed for relative abundance, seasonality, cyclicity, long-term trends, spatial variability, inter-relationships, and relative contributions of individual phytoplankton groups to primary production (PP, using Chl-a as a proxy). The results reveal that the numerically dominant phytoplankton group in terms of relative abundance is Cya, comprising about 57% of the planktonic biomass, followed closely by Coc (about 40%), while Dia constitutes almost 3% of the total abundance. Dia was found to have the strongest annual cycle, and hence displayed the highest rate of seasonal variability. Clear spatial segregation patterns have also been uncovered; Coc and Dia are strongly correlated in the Northern SCS (NSCS) while Cya dominate in Southern SCS (SSCS). Coc and Dia display a strong positive correlation with PP, whereas the seasonal relationships between Cya and Chlo with PP are non-linear, and hence appear statistically non-significant. The rise in the trend of Cya and decrease in Coc, since 2004, may be indicative of changes in successional patterns of phytoplankton functional groups in the SCS. This study, therefore, sets the precedence for more robust research to uncover the immediate and remote causes of the observed spatiotemporal changes in marine phytoplankton dynamics and to develop predictive models of marine primary productivity (MPP) and ecological health.","Ndah, A.B.; Dagar, L.; Becek, K.; Odihi, J.O.",WOS:000474363400001,"Ndah, Anthony, A.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100598,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Phytoplankton; Functional groups; Marine primary production; Spatiotemporal dynamics; South china sea,Journal article,,,"Univ Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link Gadong, BE-1410 Bsb, Brunei.",Brunei,Phytoplankton; Functional groups; Marine primary production; Spatiotemporal dynamics; South china sea,PEARL RIVER ESTUARY; TIME-SERIES; NUTRIENTS; SYSTEM; BLOOM; OCEAN; BAY; ABUNDANCE; REACHES; MODEL,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The complex geopolitical layout of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) introduces the potential for migratory species to cross multiple boundaries, consequently a lack of scientific data could complicate regional management. In the current study, we highlight both the relative lack of spatial data available in the WIO, and the prevalence of transboundary movements in species that have previously been studied in the region. Five tiger sharks <i>Galeocerdo cuvier</i> were tracked with near real‐time positioning (SPOT) satellite tags to determine individual shark movements relative to EEZs within the WIO. Concurrently, a literature search was performed to identify all satellite telemetry studies conducted to date in the WIO for marine megafaunal species, and the results compared to global satellite telemetry effort. Finally, the satellite tracks of all marine species monitored in the WIO were extracted and digitized to examine the scale of transboundary movements that occur in the region. Tiger sharks exhibited both coastal and oceanic movements, with one individual crossing a total of eight EEZs. Satellite telemetry effort in the WIO has not matched the global increase, with only 4.7% of global studies occurring in the region. Species in the WIO remained within the EEZ in which they were tagged in only three studies, while all other species demonstrated some level of transboundary movement. This study demonstrates the lack of spatial data available for informed regional management in an area where transboundary movements by marine megafauna are highly prevalent. Without more dedicated funding and research, the rich biodiversity of the WIO is at risk of overexploitation from the diverse threats present within the various political regions.","Barkley, A.N.; Gollock, M.; Samoilys, M.; Llewellyn, F.; Shivji, M.; Wetherbee, B.; Hussey, N.E.",WOS:000488866900002,"Hussey, N.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/acv.12493,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Windsor, Biol Sci, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",Canada,Western Indian Ocean; spatial management; tiger sharks; exclusive economic zones; satellite tags; tracking; transboundary; migration,SHARKS CARCHARIAS-TAURUS; HABITAT USE; ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; MIGRATION; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; FISHERIES; COAST; CONSERVATION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

To explore how they synergistically respond to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors, in the framework of the Project RITMARE four lagoons of the Po River Delta were sampled in May 2016: two with more marine features, i.e. Scardovari (SC) and Caleri (CL), and two more directly affected by the Po River flow, i.e. Canarin (CN) and Vallona-Marinetta (MV). The abundance and structure of benthic communities were related to physical-chemical parameters i.e. grain-size, total N, total organic C, stable C and N isotopes, and synthetic organic contaminants. Stations were gathered into three distinct groups (R<sub>ansosim</sub> = 0.540 p < 0.001) according to their different physical-chemical features: outer, inner-freshwater and inner-marine sites. Contamination levels did not seem to severely affect the microbial abundances that were overall stimulated by the combined effect of high organic and nutrient loads: prokaryotes up to +42% and MPB up to +93%. Bacteria and Archaea displayed high densities at sites directly influenced by the freshwater input and anthropogenically derived nitrogen. Delta- (30.8%), Alpha- (12.8%), Gamma- (11.8%) and Beta-Proteobacteria (7.1%) were the dominant classes at all sites. For both communities, a significant inter-lagoonal (among different lagoons) and intra-lagoonal (among stations within the same lagoon) pattern was highlighted by PERMANOVA. nMDS and SIMPER analyses revealed distinct assemblages in the inner and outer parts of the lagoons. We applied a novel functional approach based on diatom life modes. At inner and outer sites, different diatom living forms developed: epipsammic (on sand) nearby the lagoonal mouths, epipelic (on mud) at the innermost sites and non-benthic forms (planktonic, tychopelagic and epiphytic) at sites directly influenced by freshwater. Distance-based Linear Models further indicated that salinity, clay and temperature were the significant drivers of the prokaryotic spatial distribution whereas clay, PAHs, PCBs and salinity best explained the MPB structure. The dominance of non-benthic diatom life modes in the more polluted lagoon (CN) suggests a negative influence of contamination on the MPB structure. Two diatom keystone species likely contribute to restore the oxic gradient in sediments frequently exposed to anoxia, allowing the subsequent microbial aerobic degradation and the recolonization of higher trophic organisms. The capacity of re-oxygenation after anoxia has important ecological and economic implications in lagoons exploited for aquaculture.","Cibic, T.; Fazi, S.; Nasi, F.; Pin, L.; Alvisi, F.; Berto, D.; Viganò, L.; Zoppini, A.; Del Negro, P.",WOS:000468256400017,"Nasi, Federica, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.009,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bacteria,,,Microbial diversity; Microphytobenthos; Bacteria; Coastal lagoon; Freshwater input; Organic enrichment; Contamination; Anoxia,Journal article,,,"Ist Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale OGS, Sez Oceanog, Via A Piccard 54, I-34151 Trieste, Italy.",Italy,Microbial diversity; Microphytobenthos; Bacteria; Coastal lagoon; Freshwater input; Organic enrichment; Contamination; Anoxia,WATER SEDIMENT SYSTEM; COASTAL LAGOONS; MAR PICCOLO; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; DIVERSITY; MICROPHYTOBENTHOS; GULF; BIODIVERSITY,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics (INOGS),x,Italy,,Research institute,Science

The coastal zones and small islands affected by SLR are likely to suffer from submergence, flooding and erosion in the future. However, very few studies have addressed the heterogeneity in SLR changes and the potential risk to coastal zones and small islands. Here we used the mean sea level (MSL) derived from satellite altimetry data to analyse the trends and accelerations of SLRs along global coastal zones and small islands.

However, the previous literature has not firmly connected agricultural legacies and innovation rates, and has consistently used low resolution data. We study the role of agricultural legacy for innovation performance using unique patent data from close to two thousand Chinese counties. We provide robust evidence that counties with a legacy of rice cultivation generate fewer patent applications than other counties, and a legacy of wheat production tends to be associated with more patent applications. The results for rice are robust to, e.g., controlling for temperature, precipitation, irrigation, disease burden, religiosity, and corruption, as well as accounting for migration patterns.

These solitary organisms, which may occur in aggregations, are often overlooked compared to its more well-known sister group, Scleractinia (stony corals), as well as the closely-related Actiniaria (sea anemones) with which they are usually confused. Data on corallimorpharians in Singapore are sparse, though there are anecdotal photographic reports of various morphotypes at intertidal localities collated by citizen scientists. Combining these citizen-science observations and field collections, this study used both morphological and DNA sequencing approaches to establish the diversity and distribution of Corallimorpharia in Singapore. Based on a collection of 31 specimens and observational data from 23 coastal sites, examination of field photographs and gross morphology yielded nine distinct morphotypes. To infer their identities based on molecular data, three DNA loci were sequenced—mitochondrial intergenic region (IGR) between the cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1 (COX1) and 3 (COX3), part of the ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 gene (ATP6), and nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS). Phylogenetic analysis, supported by detailed examination of the internal and external morphology, recovered six morphospecies placed within four genus-level clades, including two species from <i>Corynactis</i> and <i>Discosoma</i> that are possibly new to science. The molecular phylogeny is nearly concordant with the morphological taxonomy and distinction between the <i>Rhodactis</i> species is equivocal, likely because of recent divergence and the limited number of molecular markers used. This study represents the first comprehensive inventory and phylogenetic analysis of corallimorpharians in Singapore that would facilitate further research on this understudied order.","Oh, R.M.; Neo, M.L.; Yap, N.W.L.; Jain, S.S.; Tan, R.; Chen, C.A.; Huang, D.",WOS:000472631400022,"Huang, Danwei, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.26107/RBZ-2019-0022,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Anthozoa,,," Anthozoa, DNA sequencing, morphology, mushroom anemones, phylogenetics, tropical coastal habitats",Journal article,,,"Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 16 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117558, Singapore.",Singapore,Anthozoa; DNA sequencing; morphology; mushroom anemones; phylogenetics; tropical coastal habitats,MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; CLASS ANTHOZOA; CNIDARIA; CORALS; SEA; FAMILIES; GENERA,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

The focus on testate amoebae in scientific research has greatly increased in the past 20 years: from an average of about 5 papers a year in the mid-1990s to the current rate of more than 50 papers published yearly. The application range of these organisms is rapidly expanding as well: from the traditional fields of environmental monitoring and paleoecology, to forensic sciences and ecotoxicology studies. These developments are nevertheless strongly dependent on reliable taxonomy and nomenclature. However, scientometric data reveal that despite an ever-increasing necessity for the use of names (the product of taxonomy), the corresponding effort has not been achieved for improving testate amoebae systematics. As a consequence, inaccurate taxonomy yields to misinterpretations in the diversity of the organisms and to potentially incorrect conclusions. These and related problems are discussed in this study, highlighting the outcome of poor taxonomic expertise in accurate classification and phylogeny of testate amoebae, and the consequences derived from it. Additionally, this study is aimed to discuss the current status of testate amoebae classification, and to present all nomenclature and taxonomic changes in higher and lower taxonomic levels of testate amoebae, as a result of recent molecular reconstructions.

Studies at community scale highlight variations in conservatism strength depending on the characteristics of the ecological interaction studied. However, the heterogeneity of datasets and methods used prevent to compare results between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here we perform such a comparison by taking plant–insect communities as a study case, with data on plant–herbivore and plant–pollinator networks. Our analysis reveals that plants acting as resources for herbivores exhibit the strongest conservatism in species interaction among the four interacting groups. Conservatism levels are similar for insect pollinators, insect herbivores and plants as interacting partners of pollinators, although insect pollinators tend to have a slightly higher conservatism than the two others. Our results thus clearly support the current view that within antagonistic networks, conservatism is stronger for species as resources than for species as consumer. Although the pattern tends to be opposite for plant–pollinator networks, our results suggest that asymmetry in conservatism is much less pronounced between the pollinators and the plant they interact with.

This study presents an analysis of the nature of the problem from first principles, reviews some available algorithmic approaches, and describes Taxamatch, an improved name matching solution for this information domain. Taxamatch employs a custom Modified Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm in tandem with a phonetic algorithm, together with a rule-based approach incorporating a suite of heuristic filters, to produce improved levels of recall, precision and execution time over the existing dynamic programming algorithms n-grams (as bigrams and trigrams) and standard edit distance. Although entirely phonetic methods are faster than Taxamatch, they are inferior in the area of recall since many real-world errors are non-phonetic in nature. Excellent performance of Taxamatch (as recall, precision and execution time) is demonstrated against a reference database of over 465,000 genus names and 1.6 million species names, as well as against a range of error types as present at both genus and species levels in three sets of sample data for species and four for genera alone.

Names, and their underlying taxonomic definitions, however, are unstable and ambiguous. This negatively impacts the utility of names as identifiers and as effective indexing tools in biological informatics where names are commonly utilized for searching, retrieving and integrating information about species. Semiotics provides a general model for describing the relationship between taxon names and taxon concepts. It distinguishes syntactics, which governs relationships among names, from semantics, which represents the relations between those labels and the taxa to which they refer. In the semiotic context, changes in semantics (i.e., taxonomic circumscription) do not consistently result in a corresponding and reflective change in syntax. Further, when syntactic changes do occur, they may be in response to semantic changes or in response to syntactic rules. This lack of consistency in the cardinal relationship between names and taxa places limits on how scientific names may be used in biological informatics in initially anchoring, and in the subsequent retrieval and integration, of relevant biodiversity information. Precision and recall are two measures of relevance. In biological taxonomy, recall is negatively impacted by changes or ambiguity in syntax while precision is negatively impacted when there are changes or ambiguity in semantics. Because changes in syntax are not correlated with changes in semantics, scientific names may be used, singly or conflated into synonymous sets, to improve recall in pattern recognition or search and retrieval. Names cannot be used, however, to improve precision. This is because changes in syntax do not uniquely identify changes in circumscription.    These observations place limits on the utility of scientific names within biological informatics applications that rely on names as identifiers for taxa. Taxonomic systems and services used to organize and integrate information about taxa must accommodate the inherent semantic ambiguity of scientific names. The capture and articulation of circumscription differences (i.e., multiple taxon concepts) within such systems must be accompanied with distinct concept identifiers that can be employed in association with, or in replacement of, traditional scientific names.","Remsen, D.",WOS:000367879500012,"Remsen, David, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/zookeys.550.9546,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,"Taxonomic name services, taxon concepts, identifiers, relevance, search and retrieval",Journal article,,,"Marine Biol Lab, Dept Marine Resources, 7 MBL St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",USA,Taxonomic name services; taxon concepts; identifiers; relevance; search and retrieval,GENERIC NAME; NOMENCLATURE; SHERBORNS; TAXA,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

Our results show the presence of differences in terms of meiofaunal abundance and biomass among habitats even when located at the same depth. Meiofaunal abundance and biomass in the upper and middle (1000–2000 m) part of the branches of the Whittard Canyon are typically higher than those reported in adjacent open slopes while, in deeper sediments (ca. 3000 m), an opposite pattern is detected. The availability of food sources (both in term of quantity and quality) plays a key role in explaining such differences. Diversity expressed either as the richness of meiofaunal taxa and of nematode species is typically higher in slopes than in the branches of the Whittard Canyon. Turnover diversity is high (40–100% for meiofaunal rare taxa and 61–78% for nematode species, respectively) either among habitats and depths. Although a general dominance of deposit feeders, predators are more abundant in slopes (9–12% of total nematode abundance) than in both branches of the Whittard Canyon (4–7%). The higher fraction of predators of the nematode assemblages inhabiting the slopes determined higher values of the maturity index (i.e., more persisters, c-p=4/5). We hypothesize that the life strategies of nematode assemblages are influenced by gravity flows, sediment instability and the 2–3 times higher availability of phytopigments, which characterize the upper part of the Whittard Canyon, favoring opportunist/colonizer species.

During such mining, benthic communities will be inevitably disturbed or destroyed. Therefore, assessments of their standing stock and composition may be helpful for the future evaluation of possible impacts of commercial nodule exploitation. Analysis of nematode communities (at genus level) inhabiting the French license area of the CCFZ were studied based on data from the cruises NODINAUT (2004) and BIONOD (2012). The total nematode density was ca. 1.5-fold higher in 2012 as compared with 2004. This reflected a 2–2.5 times higher density of non-selective deposit-feeders (i.e. possessing a small buccal cavity without armature) in 2012 compared with 2004, whereas no significant differences between sampling periods were observed in the density of the other feeding groups. Consequently, whilst the list of the most abundant genera was identical, their relative abundances changed significantly. The relative abundance of the genus <i>Thalassomon hystera</i> was two times greater in 2012 than in 2004, whereas the relative abundances of the genera <i>Acantholaimus</i> and <i>Theristus</i> were significantly lower in 2012 (10% and 4%, respectively) than in 2004 (28% and 9%). Nematode diversity (including values of diversity indices and total number of recorded genera) was significantly lower in 2012 in comparison with 2004. Although our data do not take into account seasonal and shorter temporal scales of variability in nematode assemblages, we report here that a certain fraction of variations observed between the two sampling periods could be associated with differences in primary production.

We suggest here that patterns in OM quantity, C degradation rates, and meiofauna community composition in 2011 were likely influenced by the intensification of the warm West Spitsbergen Current (WSC). We hypothesize that the intensity of the WSC inflow to the Arctic Ocean could have an important role on benthic biodiversity and functioning of deep-sea Arctic ecosystems.","Pusceddu, A.; Carugati, L.; Gambi, C.; Mienert, J.; Petani, B.; Sanchez-Vidal, A.; Canals, M.; Heussner, S.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000368750900005,"Carugati, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr.2015.11.004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Arctic margin; Currents; Organic matter; Biodiversity; Meiofauna; Nematodes,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Ancona, Italy.",Italy,Arctic margin; Currents; Organic matter; Biodiversity; Meiofauna; Nematodes,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; STANDING STOCK; ATLANTIC WATER; FRAM STRAIT; TIME-SERIES; SEA; CARBON; PATTERNS; NEMATODE; CANYON,Oceanography,Oceanography,Marche Polytechnic University - Department of Life and Environment,x,,,,

As an important component of the tidal flat, tidal creeks tend to have unique, contrasting habitats associated with erosion and accretion beds within a short distance of each other. The gradient represented by these habitats is expected to have consequences on the meiofauna and nematode communities. Based on sediment samples from two tidal creeks on a tidal flat covered with very fine-grained sediments, we show that there are distinct relationships between the benthic habitats, meiofauna/nematode communities and the erosion/accretion status of the tidal creek bed. Although there were no differences in sediment grain size between the eroding and accretion sides of the creek, higher sedimentary phaeopigment, total organic carbon and water contents were observed at the accreting side compared to the eroding side. The meiofauna exhibited a significant spatial variability between the two sides. The dominant taxon, nematodes, was more abundant on the accretion side, whilst copepods were more abundant on the erosion side of the creeks. The nematode/copepod ratio was in agreement with the observation that more pollutants and/or organic matter settled down on the accretion side. A total of 53 nematode genera were identified, belonging to 3 orders and 22 families. The prevalence of tolerant nematode genera such as <i>Desmodora, Sabatieria</i> and <i>Viscosia</i>, suggested that nematodes inhabiting highly dynamic environments are well adapted to the physical disturbance.

Here, we investigated the response of nematode assemblages to the presence of offshore gas platforms (located in the central Mediterranean Sea) in terms of spatial heterogeneity, structural and functional diversity. Since the effect of the investigated offshore platforms on macrofaunal assemblages were previously assessed by Terlizzi et al. (2008), the study provided also the opportunity to compare the response of different benthic compartments to the same impact related to fossil fuel extraction on marine environments. The platforms had a significant impact on nematode assemblages up to 1000 m distance from the structure. The effects were evident in term of: a) more homogeneous spatial distribution of nematode assemblages, b) increased trophic diversity of deposit feeders and c) changes in life strategies with an increase of opportunistic species in sediments closer to the platforms. Such effects seemed to be related to the dimension of the platform structures, rather than to chemical pollution or changes in food availability. These findings suggest that the platforms exert a physical alteration of the surrounding environment that is reflected by altered structural and functional traits of nematode biodiversity. The use of nematodes for monitoring the effects of the platforms only partially matched with the results obtained using macrofauna, providing further insights on potential outcomes on the functional response of marine assemblages to fossil fuel extraction.","Fraschetti, S.; Guarnieri, G.; Gambi, C.; Bevilacqua, S.; Terlizzi, A.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000372557500007,"Terlizzi, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.02.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Benthic ecology; Offshore structures; Nematodes; Community function; Spatial variability,Journal article,,,"Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, CoNISMa, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",Italy,Benthic ecology; Offshore structures; Nematodes; Community function; Spatial variability,GULF-OF-MEXICO; BOTTOM BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; DEEP-SEA; MACROFAUNA ASSEMBLAGES; TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION; MEIOFAUNA RESPONSE; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; ADRIATIC SEA; DIVERSITY; DISTURBANCE,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,University of Salento,x,Italy,,University,Science

Both taxonomic and functional approaches were applied to nematode communities in order to describe the community structure and to relate it with the environmental parameters along the estuary. At all sampling events, nematode assemblages reflected the estuarine gradient, and salinity and grain size composition were confirmed to be the main abiotic factors controlling the distribution of the assemblages.  Moreover, the low temporal variability may indicate that natural variability is superimposed by the anthropogenic pressures present in some areas of the estuary.

Global trend of depth and latitudinal related variations have also been noticed from BoB shelf in terms of nematode abundance and species richness, albeit heterogeneity patterns were encountered in functional attributes. Index of trophic diversity values revealed higher trophic diversity across the BoB shelf and suggested variety of food resource availability.

The peaks at different positions clearly visualized heterogeneity in distribution patterns for both size and biomass spectrum and also there was evidence of availability of diversified food resources. Nematode biomass spectra (NBS) constructed for nematode communities showed shift in peak biomass values towards lower to moderate size classes particularly in shallower depth but did not get reflected in latitudes. However, Chennai and Parangipettai transects demonstrated shift in peak biomass values towards higher biomass classes explaining the representation of higher nematode abundance. Our findings concluded that depth and latitudes are physical variables; they may not directly affect nematode community structure and functional attributes but they might influence the other factors such as food availability, sediment deposition and settlement rate.

The effects of four different types of hydrocarbons were examined: clean mineral lube oil, used mineral lube oil, synthetic lube oil marketed as being rapidly biodegradable, and diesel fuel (Special Antarctic Blend). Sediments were sieved to remove macrofauna and then treated with one of the oils, then deployed in trays on the seabed (12–18 m) under sea ice, along with control, uncontaminated sediment. Samples of the meiofaunal communities were collected at one, two and five years and nematodes identified to genus and copepods to family. There were significant differences between meiofaunal communities in hydrocarbon-treated sediment compared to controls, but each hydrocarbon type had quite different effects. Effects persisted to five years and communities showed no signs of recovery or becoming more similar to controls. Nematodes were more sensitive to hydrocarbons than copepods, showing very distinct community differences between different treatments which persisted over the five years. In contrast, copepod communities showed less distinct, more variable changes, which decreased in severity over five years. Nematode abundance initially decreased in hydrocarbon treatments in comparison to controls, except for the biodegradable oil treatment, and this persisted also over five years. In contrast, copepod abundance initially increased in hydrocarbon treatments compared to controls, and then declined, and by five years abundances were lower in hydrocarbon treatments than in controls. Whilst structural community, abundance and diversity differences for nematodes and copepods remained after 5 years, the nematode functional parameters based on feeding types and maturity characteristics showed a substantial degree of recovery after 5 years, suggesting some functional recovery of the nematode community. This experiment demonstrates that different hydrocarbons can have very different effects on sediment meiofauna and that despite strong patterns of community effects it was very difficult to characterize effects on different taxa. The effects of oils in sediments are also likely to persist for periods greater than five years and could take decades to recover.","Stark, J.S.; Mohammad, M.; McMinn, A.; Ingels, J.",WOS:000412252700008,"Mohammad, Mahadi, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.009,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Copepoda, ""Nematoda""",,,Oil; Diesel fuel; Copepods; Nematodes; Field experiment; Environmental impacts,Journal article,,,"Australian Antarctic Div, Antarctic Conservat & Management Theme, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia.",Australia,Oil; Diesel fuel; Copepods; Nematodes; Field experiment; Environmental impacts,NEMATODE-COPEPOD RATIO; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; OIL-SPILL; LONG-TERM; PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SUBTIDAL SEDIMENTS; ORGANIC ENRICHMENT; LUBRICANT OILS; POLLUTION,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The sediment quality was defined by measuring the level of organic enrichment (quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter) and oxygen stress (redox potential).    Nematode biomass spectra (NBS) proved to be extremely valuable in determining differences in the environmental quality of sediments on a hundred-metre spatial scale. High peaks of the NBS were observed in the more organic-rich and oxygen-stressed stations probably in relation to a lower diversity of the nematode communities in these stations, with the predominance of tolerant genera such as Paracomesoma and Sabatieria. Among allometric variables, the length was found to be negatively correlated with oxygen concentrations and positively with TOM percentages, whilst the morphotype length/width ratio (L/W) resulted negatively related to oxygen concentrations and organic matter quality (protein:carbohydrate ratio), suggesting that these allometric attributes represent indicators of the functional adaptation of nematodes to the changing environmental conditions.

However, meiofauna have only recently been included in studies of those environments and detailed information on these communities is still rare. This is especially true in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, even though there are many seamounts with active vents in the calderas of the region.

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions were found among sampling stations, and some variables, such as depth, inorganic carbon, carbon/nitrogen ratio, bottom-water oxygen, and percentage of sand, proved influential on total community abundance. Nematodes were the dominant meiofaunal group and its abundance highly variable among sites and sampling periods. Nematofauna was dominated by bacterivores, which also possessed the highest maturity index. Environmental characteristics showed a significant relation with community structure, not so the dispersal of nematode genera.

This study represents the first attempt to use nematode descriptors in order to assign ecological quality (EcoQ) status to areas along the Sarawak coasts, thus integrating the methods actually applied by the Department of Environment (DOE). Three nematode parameters, i.e. colonizer–persister percentage, maturity index (MI), and Shannon diversity index (Hˈ), were used, as they are recognized as the best descriptors of EcoQ status in coastal habitats. The thresholds applied to the nematode parameters for the Sarawak study sites showed predominantly moderate and bad EcoQ status, with the exception of the Similajau site, which being close to a national park was found to have good EcoQ. The sites with the worst EcoQ were characterized by low salinity values, suggesting riverine inflows as a primary source of pollution, likely from the discharge of untreated wastes. This was confirmed by both the Hˈ and MI indices, which showed a close positive relation with salinity. Results obtained for the Niah site may suggest that “traces” of pollution were left in the nematode assemblages that could not be detected from other parameters of the water column.

An ecological survey was conducted along the Apulian coast (South Italy) to explore potential relationships between the degree of human disturbance and meiobenthic communities which are still unexplored. Sediment samples were collected in triplicate from 3 stations along each of 16 transects and at a different depth gradient (from ∼10 to 50 m). The levels of taxa richness and biodiversity of the meiobenthic and nematode assemblages were overall high. The Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive suggest the creation of specific thresholds to define the EcoQ (Ecological Quality) status of marine coastal systems. The thresholds applied on the meiobenthos showed the worst conditions at Brindisi harbour and at the mussel farm infrastructure of Castro. An overall moderate impact was also detected at the multiple-use Marine Protect Area of Porto Cesareo, likely due to the overwhelming number of tourists leading to an increase of organic enrichment (sewage discharge) negatively affecting the benthic communities assemblages. The main representatives of the nematode assemblages were taxa known as typical of muddy sediments. When EcoQ was assessed with the nematode thresholds, the worst EcoQ was found at Brindisi Harbour, Torre Specchia, and Alimini Lakes. The ecological conditions revealed by meiobenthic and nematode assemblages were generally consistent and seem to highlight a greater alteration of the meiobenthic communities assemblages along the Adriatic than the Ionian coasts.","Semprucci, F.; Balsamo, M.; Appolloni, L.; Sandulli, R.",WOS:000428260400007,"Semprucci, Federica, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-017-0745-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Meiobenthos; Nematodes; Monitoring; Fauna; Ecological assessment; Shallow subtidal habitats ,Journal article,,,"Univ Urbino, Dipartimento Sci Biomol DiSB, Campus Sci, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",Italy,Meiobenthos; Nematodes; Monitoring; Fauna; Ecological assessment; Shallow subtidal habitats,ADRIATIC SEA; MICROHABITAT TYPE; MARINE NEMATODES; MEIOFAUNA; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; MACROFAUNA; PLATFORMS; DIVERSITY,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

We set out a pilot experiment at 1700&nbsp;m depth on the Lucky Strike vent field (Eiffel Tower, Mid-Atlantic Ridge). Synthetic sponges were deployed in 2011 at five sites along a gradient of hydrothermal activity and were recovered in 2013, and the composition of macro- and meiofauna was assessed on four of them. The influence of temperature and fluid inputs on colonizer faunal abundance and diversity was analyzed. Faunal abundance and diversity decreased with increasing distance from vent emission. The colonizers were represented by a subset of species characterizing the natural populations at the Eiffel Tower edifice. Some taxa (e.g., pycnogonids, ophiuroids, cnidarians, foraminiferans) represented new records not yet found on deployed substrata on the Eiffel Tower. Synthetic sponges harbored a high percentage (from 17.5% to 55%) of juveniles and larval stages of polychaetes, molluscs, and copepods. A mature nematode community (mainly <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Cephalochaetosoma</em> and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Halomonhystera</em>) in a reproductive stage was found. Variability in faunal composition was significantly correlated with distance from fluid emission.

In early 2006, the eruption of the underwater volcano at 9°50’N East Pacific Rise wiped out almost the entire faunal communities of the area. This provided us with the opportunity to study nematode primary succession at vents as well as on adjacent seafloor basalt. Nematode abundance and richness were extremely low at all studied sites in late 2006 and 2007, and increased only slightly in 2009. Interestingly, the most abundant species during early succession were also prominent in this area prior to the eruption. Our results show that nematodes are extremely influenced by volcanic eruptions and need a long period of time to colonize the lava-flooded area in greater numbers and richness. We hypothesize that low food availability on the young bare basalt and harsh environmental conditions at early succession vent sites might hinder a more successful nematode establishment. In addition to the newly established active vent sites we also studied an inactive vent site that was not directly hit by the eruption but whose vent fluid had ceased after the eruption. At this inactive and older vent, diversity was also relatively low but was higher than at the younger, newly established sites.

In this study, we used an integrative taxonomic approach, combining both molecular and morphological methods, to characterize nematodes of distinct sex and ontogenetic stages from three sampling sites of the North Sea. Morphospecies were discriminated after first visual determination, followed by a molecular analysis of the nuclear 28S rDNA: D2–D3 marker. By linking each sequence to a morphological voucher, discordant morphological identification was subjected to a so-called reverse taxonomic approach. Molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and morphospecies were compared for all of the three sampling sites to assess concordance of methodology. In total, 32 MOTUs and 26 morphospecies were assigned, of which 12 taxa were identified as described species. Both approaches showed high concordance in taxon assignment (84.4 %) except for a cluster comprising various Sabatieria species.

We determined monthly phytoplankton species richness by using niche modeling and >540,000 global phytoplankton observations to predict biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species. Consistent with metabolic theory, phytoplankton richness in the tropics is about three times that in higher latitudes, with temperature being the most important driver. However, below 19°C, richness is lower than expected, with ~8°– 14°C waters (~35° to 60° latitude) showing the greatest divergence from theoretical predictions. Regions of reduced richness are characterized by maximal species turnover and environmental variability, suggesting that the latter reduces species richness directly, or through enhancing competitive exclusion. The nonmonotonic relationship between phytoplankton richness and temperature suggests unanticipated complexity in responses of marine biodiversity to ocean warming.","Righetti, D.; Vogt, M.; Gruber, N.; Psomas, A.",WOS:000470125000017,"Vogt, Meike, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1126/sciadv.aau6253,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Environm Phys, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Switzerland,,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; METABOLIC THEORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; RANGE; SIZE; DETERMINANTS; ZOOPLANKTON; SELECTION,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics (IBP),x,,,,

Within-species variation in thermal sensitivity, caused by phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of thermal limits, is often overlooked in assessments of species responses to warming. Despite this, implicit assumptions of thermal niche conservatism or adaptation and plasticity at the species level permeate the literature with potentially important implications for predictions of warming impacts at the population level. Here we review how these attributes interact with the spatial and temporal context of ocean warming to influence the vulnerability of marine organisms. We identify a broad spectrum of thermal sensitivities among marine organisms, particularly in central and cool-edge populations of species distributions. These are characterized by generally low sensitivity in organisms with conserved thermal niches, to high sensitivity for organisms with locally adapted thermal niches. Important differences in thermal sensitivity among marine taxa suggest that warming could adversely affect benthic primary producers sooner than less vulnerable higher trophic groups. Embracing the spatial, temporal and biological context of within-species variation in thermal physiology helps explain observed impacts of ocean warming and can improve forecasts of climate change vulnerability in marine systems.","Bennett, S.; Duarte, C.M.; Marba, N.; Wernberg, T.",WOS:000473329200008,"Bennett, Scott, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rstb.2018.0550,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Global Change Res Grp, Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Spain.",Spain,climate variability; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; acclimation; niche conservatism; thermal safety margins,MOUNTAIN PASSES; TEMPERATURE; TOLERANCE; ADAPTATION; LIMITS; RANGE; VULNERABILITY; EVOLUTIONARY; ECTOTHERMS; PATTERNS,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,,,,

Along with coastal rocky cliffs, isolated coralligenous concretions emerging from muddy bottoms are typical structures of the Mediterranean Sea mesophotic zone. Coralligenous concretions at mesophotic depths in the South Tyrrhenian Sea were investigated to assess the role of these coralligenous oases in relation to the biodiversity of surrounding soft sediments. We show here that the complex structures of the coralligenous concretions at ca. 110 m depth influence the trophic conditions, the biodiversity and assemblage composition in the surrounding sediments even at considerable distances. Coral concretions not only represent deep oases of coral biodiversity but they also promote a higher biodiversity of the fauna inhabiting the surrounding soft sediments. Using the biodiversity of nematodes as a proxy of the total benthic biodiversity, a high turnover biodiversity within a 200 m distance from the coralligenous concretions was observed. Such turnover is even more evident when only rare taxa are considered and seems related to specific trophic conditions, which are influenced by the presence of the coralligenous structures. The presence of a high topographic complexity and the trophic enrichment make these habitats highly biodiverse, nowadays endangered by human activities (such as exploitation of commercial species such as <em>Corallium rubrum</em>, or trawling fisheries, which directly causes habitat destruction or indirectly causes modification in the sedimentation and re-suspension rates). We stress that the protection of the coralligenous sea concretions is a priority for future conservation policies at the scale of large marine ecosystems and that a complete census of these mesophotic oases of biodiversity should be a priority for future investigations in the Mediterranean Sea.","Bianchelli, S.; Pusceddu, A.; Canese, S.; Greco, S.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000320576400127,"Bianchelli, Silvia, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0066553,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,LIGURIAN SEA; VERTICAL CLIFF; ORGANIC-MATTER; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; ECOSYSTEM; SEDIMENTS; HABITAT; BAY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Marche Polytechnic University - Department of Life and Environment,x,,,,

A variety of sediment transport processes occur in the area, differing in the frequency and magnitude of sediment mobility, and the continuum between erosion, translation and sediment accumulation. The seabed contained a variety of bedforms, including longitudinal furrows, and small to very large sandwaves. The bed sediments were dominated by fine and medium sands, with admixtures of silt and gravel. Based on sedimentary bedforms and grain size analysis, a total of 11 sedimentary facies were delineated, of which 8 were analysed in detail for their relationships with the meiofauna. The sedimentary facies fell clearly into groups of facies, respectively representing high, high-moderate and moderate, and episodic sediment mobility. For those sedimentary facies where daily movement of sediments and bedforms occurred (‘high’ sediment mobility), the resulting spatially homogeneous environments were dominated by an impoverished nematode community comprising small deposit feeders and large predators. Resistance to sediment movement and the ability to exploit alternative food sources were prominent functional features of the successful colonisers. Those facies characterised by relatively infrequent sediment mobility (‘episodic’ and ‘high-moderate and moderate’ sediment mobility) comprised a heterogeneous suite of benthic habitats, containing taxonomically and functionally diverse assemblages of nematodes of various sizes, feeding types and reproductive potential. Faunal distribution patterns here indicated trade-offs between the resistance to sediment movement, environmental tolerance and competitive abilities. Our focus on diverse assemblages of organisms with high turnover times, inhabiting highly dynamic sedimentary environments, has revealed new animal-sediment relationships of relevance to pure and applied science.","Schratzberger, M.; Larcombe, P.",WOS:000345204000072,"Larcombe, Piers, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0109445,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.",England,,BENTHIC DISTURBANCE REGIMES; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; DIVERSITY; COMPETITION; DISPERSAL; BANKS; WATER; MICROHABITAT; SURROGATES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)",x,,,,

Metabarcoding could facilitate the census of biodiversity, especially for those tiny metazoans for which morphological identification is difficult. We compared, for the first time, different DNA extraction procedures based on the use of two commercial kits and a previously published laboratory protocol and tested their suitability for sequencing analyses of 18S rDNA of marine nematodes. We also investigated the reliability of Roche 454 sequencing analyses for assessing the biodiversity of deep-sea nematode assemblages previously morphologically identified. Finally, intra-genomic variation in 18S rRNA gene repeats was investigated by Illumina MiSeq in different deep-sea nematode morphospecies to assess the influence of polymorphisms on nematode biodiversity estimates. Our results indicate that the two commercial kits should be preferred for the molecular analysis of biodiversity of deep-sea nematodes since they consistently provide amplifiable DNA suitable for sequencing. We report that the morphological identification of deep-sea nematodes matches the results obtained by metabarcoding analysis only at the order-family level and that a large portion of Operational Clustered Taxonomic Units (OCTUs) was not assigned. We also show that independently from the cut-off criteria and bioinformatic pipelines used, the number of OCTUs largely exceeds the number of individuals and that 18S rRNA gene of different morpho-species of nematodes displayed intra-genomic polymorphisms. Our results indicate that metabarcoding is an important tool to explore the diversity of deep-sea nematodes, but still fails in identifying most of the species due to limited number of sequences deposited in the public databases, and in providing quantitative data on the species encountered. These aspects should be carefully taken into account before using metabarcoding in quantitative ecological research and monitoring programmes of marine biodiversity.","Dell'Anno, A.; Carugati, L.; Corinaldesi, C.; Riccioni, G.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000367092600036,"Carugati, Laura, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0144928,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,FREE-LIVING MARINE; POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; DIVERSITY; MAGNITUDE; SEQUENCES; PATTERNS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Marche Polytechnic University,x,Italy,,University,Science

Nematode worms are ubiquitous across most habitats on earth, yet little is known about host‐associated microbial assemblages within the phylum. Free‐living nematodes are globally abundant and diverse in marine sediments, with species exhibiting distinct buccal cavity (mouth) morphologies that are thought to play an important role in feeding ecology and life history strategies. Here, we investigated patterns in marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing host‐associated microbial taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat types (deep‐sea, shallow water, methane seeps, Lophelia coral mounds, kelp holdfasts) across three distinct geographic regions (Arctic, Southern California and Gulf of Mexico). Microbiome profiles were generated from single worms spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two‐gene metabarcoding approach to amplify the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene targeting bacteria/archaea and the V1–V2 region of the 18S rRNA gene targeting microbial eukaryotes. Contrary to our expectations, nematode microbiome profiles demonstrated no distinct patterns either globally (across depths and ocean basins) or locally (within site); prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial assemblages did not correlate with nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny or morphological identity, ocean region or marine habitat type. However, fine‐scale analysis of nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats, free‐living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding morphology.

The central stations, represented by fine sediments and higher amounts of organic carbon, seemed to be characterized by low meiofaunal densities, nematode diversity and a strong dominance of 1B and 2B trophic guilds. These trends could be related not only to the grain size and organic load, but also to a possible influence of tidal currents that can transport pollutants in the central area of the lagoon coming from the adjacent coastal areas.

The statistical analysis highlighted a significant taxonomic difference of the assemblages between the stations characterized by fine and medium-coarse sands, respectively, in line with the auto-ecological preferences of the taxa detected. The use of some nematode descriptors for assessing the ecological quality status (EQS) of the lagoon has revealed a slight disturbance in the station close to Viligili, one of the most urbanized islands.

Nematodes are already used as indicator species in biodiversity assessments and biomonitoring of terrestrial and marine systems, with molecular approaches offering the opportunity to utilize these organisms further in large scale ecological surveys and environmental assessments. Based on an available nematode dataset for estuarine sediments of the Mira estuary (SW coast, Portugal), we evaluated the diversity of the nematode community of this system, using the molecular markers 18S rRNA and COI genes. These approaches were compared to voucher specimens from a morphological characterization of the same samples allowing validation and comparison between nematode communities. The spatial and temporal variability of the density and diversity of the nematode assemblages was analyzed based on morphological characterization to allow the validation and efficiency of the genetic characterization. A PCO ordination plot showed a distinct separation of the assemblages between sampling occasions confirmed by PERMANOVA analysis, which showed significant differences, although no significant differences were detected between sampling sites. The morphological characterization identified 50 genera of which only 26 and 25 distinct 18S rRNA and COI DNA barcodes, respectively, were obtained. 90.2% of the morphologically identified specimens representing eleven different genera, successfully generated DNA barcodes for both 18S rRNA and COI genes. This study confirmed that the success of the 18S rRNA gene PCR amplification is higher than of COI gene with 43 species amplified against 34. The study highlights a limitation of available sequences for both targets in databases when compared to the known diversity of marine nematodes. The gene sequences of this study enriched the databases, contributing gene sequences from 7 to 16 new genera for the 18S rRNA and COI genes, respectively. A robust database of gene sequences is a prerequisite for the development of robust high sample throughput techniques to be applied in marine assessing and monitoring programs.","Avó, A.P.; Daniell, T.J.; Neilson, R.; Oliveira, S.; Branco, J.; Adão, H.",WOS:000457690600066,"Avó, Ana, A.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2017.00066,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Evora, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Biol, Evora, Portugal.",Portugal,benthic nematodes; DNA barcoding; good environmental status (GES); biodiversity assessment; COI; molecular monitoring; 185 rRNA,LIVING MARINE NEMATODES; ZOSTERA-NOLTII; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SOIL NEMATODES; TAXONOMY; MEIOBENTHOS; MEIOFAUNA; EMPHASIS; SCIENCE; PHYLUM,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The body shape has a bimodal distribution with two morphotypes, suggesting adaptations to lifestyle. In fine sediments (seagrass bed), slender nematodes dominated, whereas sandy sediments had mostly stout nematodes but also slender forms. Seaweed turf from hard bottom substrates may favour mostly slender nematodes, whereas dead coral harbours both morphotypes, probably as a result of high heterogeneity of the substrate. The size spectra of abundance vs mass class shows a negative exponential relationship, suggesting that the energetic equivalence hypothesis holds for nematodes. The shape and position of the size spectra depended on the type of habitat.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraspecific variability of morphological characters that are most often used in <em>Acantholaimus</em> taxonomy, in order to distinguish those which are most informative for species differentiation. A reverse taxonomic approach was applied for initial species discrimination. Two loci, one each from small and large subunits of rRNA, were sequenced for 59 <em>Acantholaimus</em> specimens from two deep-sea locations. Twenty-seven Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU) were identified, of which 12 were represented by more than one individual. These were then analysed for intraspecific variability in morphological characters. Some of the examined characters showed high intraspecific variability; specifically: length of cephalic setae; distance from anterior end to amphid; shape of anterior setae; position and arrangement of cervical setae. In the absence of genetic data, these characters should be used with caution for differential diagnoses or species discrimination. Other characters were more conservative within the same MOTU: body proportions; length of outer labial setae; amphidial diam.; appearance of lateral field; general arrangement of cervical setae; and shape of tail.

Preliminary analyses of phylogenetic relationships within the Axonolaimidae provide some support for the monophyly of <em>Odontophora</em>, but drawing more solid inferences about relationships within the Axonolaimidae will require more molecular sequence data of accurately (and verifiably) identified species.","Leduc, D.; Zhao, Z.Q.",WOS:000388731300001,"Zhao, Zeng, Z.Q.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1163/15685411-00003018,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,     18S rDNA; D2-D3; intertidal sediments; key; marine nematode; molecular; morphology; morphometrics; new species; species inquirenda; taxonomy ,Journal article,,,"Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Private Bag 14-901, Wellington, New Zealand.",New Zealand,18S rDNA; D2-D3; intertidal sediments; key; marine nematode; molecular; morphology; morphometrics; new species; species inquirenda; taxonomy,LIVING MARINE NEMATODES,Zoology,Zoology,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA),,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

They are most common in sediments, comprising up to 92 % of the living carbon community. Nematodes are grouped with other marine and estuarine organisms that are less than 1 mm in size but greater than 50 μm and are collectively referred to as meiofauna. A total of 338 marine and estuarine nematode species have been recorded from South Africa of which 30 are endemic. A number of factors affect meiofaunal community structure including particle size of the sediment, organic matter content, salinity, temperature, redox potential, oxygen concentration and, on exposed sandy beaches, desiccation and wave action. The proportion of nematodes within the meiofauna component increased from 20 % on the east coast to 60 % on the south coast in the Port Elizabeth area on sandy shores. A similar study at Robben Island, off the west coast of South Africa, showed nematodes to represent more than 86 % of the meiofauna. Most of the local research on nematodes has been conducted in estuaries that are permanently open. As on sea shores, nematodes dominated the meiofauna in these estuaries, and their abundance was affected by particle size, oxygen and desiccation. Research at Saldanha Bay in South Africa is also referred to and shows that estuarine nematodes can be used as biomonitors. High concentrations of heavy metals below the rafts existed, and nematode fauna was dominated by a <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Sabatieria</em> sp.

Details of Albin’s description, including tail color, are very similar to those of Bartram’s description. The only discrepancies are minor differences in color of softparts and tail that seem explicable as intraspecific variation. Available evidence suggests that Bartram knew nothing of Albin’s description, and if so, Albin’s bird provides quite persuasive support for the validity of Bartram’s bird. Equally important, none of the arguments offered historically against the validity of the Painted Vulture is persuasive when examined closely.

Consistently with a general pattern of distribution reported by several studies on benthic organisms, our results showed a decrease in the abundance and changes in the taxa composition of the meiofaunal community along the exterior-interior axis of the caves, also highlighting the dissimilarity between the dark and semi-dark communities. We found a significant influence of the availability of organic matter (i.e. phytopigment concentrations) on the distribution and composition of both the meiofauna and the nematode community inside the caves. Different nematode assemblages characterized the inside and the outside of the two caves, with species occurring exclusively in the sediment of both caves, particularly in the dark portions, and completely absent in the external sediments. Environmental features of submarine caves may affect food resources inside the caves and consequently trophic nematode assemblages.

This is particularly evident for the deep sea, the largest biome of the biosphere, where information on the scales of spatial variation is very scant. Here, we investigated deep-sea nematodes species richness, turnover and functional diversity, and life strategies at different spatial scales (from local to macro-regional) to identify the factors that shape regional (γ) and macro-regional (ε) deep-sea diversity. This study was conducted in several deep-sea habitats (canyons, open slopes, deep-water corals, and bathyal plains) over > 2000 km across the whole Mediterranean Basin, at a bathymetric range comprised between ca. 600 and 1300 m. Our results indicate that the patterns of local (α) diversity across the deep Mediterranean follow the gradients of the trophic conditions, which decrease from the western to the eastern basins. For all of the sites and habitats, the α diversity is generally low. Conversely, the turnover diversity changes significantly among habitats (β diversity) and between regions (δ diversity), showing values of dissimilarity (based on species presence/absence matrixes) between 59 and 90% for β diversity and between 81 and 89% for δ diversity. This suggests that patterns and values of γ and ε diversities in the deep Mediterranean Sea are related to turnover diversity among habitats and between regions (β and δ diversities), rather than to the local biodiversity (α diversity). These results indicate also that the differences in β and δ diversities are even more important than those in α diversity for the comprehension of the drivers of biodiversity in the deep Mediterranean Sea. We conclude that the presence of different habitats and gradients in environmental conditions, by promoting a high turnover diversity across the Mediterranean Sea, may play a crucial role in the levels of γ diversity of deep-sea nematodes.","Bianchelli, S.; Gambi, C.; Mea, M.; Pusceddu, A.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000323980300015,"Bianchelli, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-10-5465-2013,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; DEEP; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; CANYON; SLOPE; HETEROGENEITY; HOTSPOTS,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Marche Polytechnic University,x,Italy,,University,Science

Observations conducted during the last 20 yr in the Lacaze-Duthiers and Cap de Creus canyons (Gulf of Lion, NW Mediterranean Sea) report several intense DSWC events. The effects of DSWC on deep-sea ecosystems are almost unknown. To investigate the effects of these episodic events, we analysed changes in the meiofaunal biodiversity inside and outside the canyon. Sediment samples were collected at depths varying from ca. 1000 to > 2100 m in May 2004 (before a major event), April 2005 (during a major cascading event) and in October 2005, August 2006, April 2008 and April 2009 (after a major event). We report here that the late winter–early spring 2005 cascading led to a reduction of the organic matter contents in canyon floor sediments down to 1800 m depth, whereas surface sediments at about 2200 m depth showed an increase. Our findings suggest that the nutritional material removed from the shallower continental shelf, canyon floor and flanks, and also the adjacent open slope was rapidly transported to the deep margin. During the cascading event the meiofaunal abundance and biodiversity in the studied deep-sea sediments were significantly lower than after the event. Benthic assemblages during the cascading were significantly different from those in all other sampling periods in both the canyon and deep margin. After only six months from the cessation of the cascading, benthic assemblages in the impacted sediments were again similar to those observed in other sampling periods, thus illustrating a quick recovery. Since the present climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of these episodic events, we anticipate that they will increasingly affect benthic bathyal ecosystems, which may eventually challenge their resilience.","Pusceddu, A.; Mea, M.; Canals, M.; Heussner, S.; Durrieu de Madron, X.; Sanchez-Vidal, A.; Bianchelli, S.; Corinaldesi, C.; Dell'Anno, A.; Thomsen, L.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000318434200034,"Danovaro, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-10-2659-2013,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,NORTHWESTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA; PORCUPINE ABYSSAL-PLAIN; LONG-TERM CHANGE; SUBMARINE CANYONS; ORGANIC-MATTER; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; NE ATLANTIC; PARTICULATE MATTER; SEDIMENT FLUXES,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Marche Polytechnic University,x,Italy,,University,Science

Biomarkers are still not used in the monitoring and assessment of this highly diverse phylum, because the technique needs to be applied at the single species level. This incurs high costs and involves time-consuming procedures, which are currently the main pitfalls when it comes to the application of these techniques to marine nematodes. Consequently, this work proposes an innovative protocol for selecting a single species from an entire community of nematodes using two independent selection processes whereby the sediment of the microcosms is progressively and separately enriched with fine and coarse sediment fractions. During our experiment, the abundance and number of nematode species decreased discernibly with exposure to both finer and coarser sediment. Multivariate analyses revealed that deposit- and epigrowth-feeders were the most tolerant feeding guilds, probably due to their deposit-feeding and microvore behaviours. At the end of the experiment, <em>Terschellingia longicaudata</em> and <em>Ptycholaimellus ponticus</em> became the unique members of the community when the sediment was enriched with fine and coarse sediment particles, respectively. After the complete alteration of the community, and when the mono-species level had been achieved, it was possible to maintain these two species alive, and without any drop in numbers, under the same laboratory conditions considered during the selection process. Accordingly, the protocol adopted here lays new foundations for the study of nematodes in the biomarker field.</p></div></div></div>","Boufahja, F.; Semprucci, F.; Beyrem, H.",WOS:000367407000030,"Boufahja, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.07.002,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Nematoda, ""Ptycholaimellus ponticus"", ""Terschellingia longicaudata""",,,Species selection; Experiment; Free-living marine nematodes; Terschellingia longicaudata; Ptycholaimellus ponticus; Sediment granulometry,Journal article,,,"Carthage Univ, Fac Sci Bizerte, Coastal Ecol & Ecotoxicol Unit, Lab Biomonitoring Environm, Zarzouna 7021, Tunisia.",Tunisia,Species selection; Experiment; Free-living marine nematodes; Terschellingia longicaudata; Ptycholaimellus ponticus; Sediment granulometry,FREE-LIVING NEMATODES; DEEP-SEA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; MARINE NEMATODES; MYTILUS-EDULIS; NORTH-SEA; MEIOFAUNA; COLONIZATION; ASSEMBLAGES; BIOMARKERS,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

In nearshore areas, dispersant application is a controversial countermeasure: environmental benefits are counteracted by the toxicity of dispersant use. The effects of the use of chemical dispersants on meiobenthic organisms and nematodes were investigated in a mesocosm experiment. A 20 day experiment was performed in four experimental sets of mesocosms. In three of them, sediments were contaminated, respectively by oil (500 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), dispersed oil (oil + 5% dispersant), and dispersant alone, whereas in the last set sediments were kept undisturbed and used as a reference (Re). Our results showed that the meiobenthic response to oil contamination was rapid, for copepods and nematodes. One-way ANOVA showed a significant decrease of the abundance of copepods. In the case of nematodes, univariate and multivariate analyses indicated a clear decrease of the abundance of the species after only 20 days of pollutant exposure and thus reducing Shannon–Wiener diversity and Pielou's evenness. In contrast, <em>Sphaerolaimus gracilis</em> and <em>Sabateria</em> sp. became more frequent within disturbed assemblages and appeared to be resistant and/or opportunistic species in the presence of these kinds of toxicants. Moreover, responses of copepods and nematodes to the treatment seemed to be the same irrespective of whether only oil or oil + dispersant was performed.

Taxonomic and functional approaches were taken to describe the assemblage structure and relate it to the abiotic environment based on a sampling scheme involving three stations and four seasons. The analysis of the nematode communities suggested that heated effluent influenced the assemblage structure or the spatial distribution of the taxa studied. The abundance of the nematodes differed significantly among seasons and stations and the numbers of species also differed significantly between stations. The seasonal variation was greater in winter and summer than in spring and autumn. The numbers of species and their abundances were highest at station 3 (impact station), attributable to the increased bottom temperature. However, the functional diversity of the assemblages did not change notably between stations or seasons. Species such as <i>Sabatieria</i> sp. (34%), <i>Linhystera</i> sp.

The cave is characterised by a marked change of the chemical water parameters below 50&nbsp;m of depth, with a relevant increase in hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and sulfates (H<sub>2</sub>S, CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>–</sup>). Thus, three stations were selected above and two below the chemo-thermocline in order to test the possible effects of the chemical variations on the meiobenthos. The difficulty of adaptation to these environmental conditions is clearly suggested by the presence of only a few dominant meiobenthic taxa in the bottom of the cave. However, meiobenthic organisms seemed more resistant than macrobenthos, which disappeared completely below this depth. The nematode assemblage was mainly represented by Xyalidae, Desmodoridae, Comesomatidae and Linhomoeidae. A high level of confinement of nematode genera at the different depths has been documented. In the upper part, their structure and biodiversity were comparable to those of the Maldivian subtidal habitats characterised by fine coralline sediments, while a notable dominance was detected in the bottom. The Blue Hole features also influenced the functional traits of the nematode assemblage with a documented increasing number of general opportunists and decrease of Maturity Index. The dominance of non-selective deposit feeders supports the hypothesis of a high amount of organic matter accumulated on the sea bottom of the cave.","Sandulli, R.; Semprucci, F.; Balsamo, M.",WOS:000344781500005,"Semprucci, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/11250003.2014.952356,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,"Meiobenthos, free-living nematodes, extreme habitats, Blue Hole, Maldives",Journal article,,,"Univ Napoli Parthenope, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol, Ctr Direz, Is C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy.",Italy,Blue Hole; Maldives; Meiobenthos; extreme habitats; free-living nematodes,MARINE NEMATODES; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; MICROHABITAT TYPE; NORTH-SEA; DEEP-SEA; MEIOFAUNA; POPULATIONS; ABUNDANCE; SEDIMENTS,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

Density and main taxa composition for macrofauna and meiofauna and species diversity and organismal traits for free-living nematodes were compared among four habitats: seagrass bed, sand flat, dead coral and hard bottom. Strong spatial patterns of distribution across habitats were detected and explained by a complex combination of habitat features. Signal/noise ratio for macrofauna data of distribution was enough strong to detect changes across habitats but the sizes of sampling devices were not adequate to represent the real patterns in the nature. Meiofauna patterns of distribution were driven by the type of substrate (unconsolidated versus hard bottoms) which surely was in turn dependent of the hydrodynamic regime. Nematodes dominated in seagrass beds and copepods in the other three habitats. Nematode density of species and individuals and species richness were highest in unconsolidated habitats maybe due to higher physical stability, larger spatial niche and more food resource availability. Diversity variation was large and similar between pairs of habitats with the exception of the hard bottom habitat which had lower differentiation. Most of the nematodes living in hard substrates showed adaptive organismal traits to cope with hydrodynamic regime and food availability (biofilm/algal turf), namely small and stout body, teeth for epigrazing, ornamented cuticle and cephalic capsule. Physical control on nematode assemblages was evident but biotic interactions may play a more important role in seagrass beds and sand flats compared to hard substrate habitats. The species diversity of nematodes, both in terms of α- and β-diversity, was high at the scale of the whole Punta Francés coral reef.","Armenteros, M.; Ruiz-Abierno, A.; Sosa, Y.; Pérez-García, J.A.",,"Sosa, Yimay, Y.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Biological traits; Caribbean Sea; coral reefs; distribution; diversity; macrofauna; meiofauna; nematodes,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that sedimentary organic matter contents, meiofaunal taxa richness and community composition, nematode α- and β-biodiversity vary significantly between alternative macroalgal and barren states. The observed differences are consistent in six areas spread across the Mediterranean Sea, irrespective of barren extent. Our results suggest also that the low biodiversity levels in barren states are the result of habitat loss/fragmentation, which is associated also with a lower availability of trophic resources. Furthermore, differences in meiofaunal and nematode abundance, biomass and diversity between macroalgal meadow and barren states persist when the latter is not fully formed, or consists of patches interspersed in macroalgal meadows. Since barren grounds are expanding rapidly along the Mediterranean Sea and meiofauna are a key trophic component in marine ecosystems, we suggest that the extension and persistence of barrens at the expenses of macroalgal meadows could also affect resilience of higher trophic level.","Bianchelli, S.; Buschi, E.; Danovaro, R.; Pusceddu, A.",WOS:000384764700001,"Pusceddu, Antonio, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/srep34544,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,BENTHIC TROPHIC STATUS; ROCKY REEFS; MARINE; DIVERSITY; HABITATS; ECOLOGY; SHIFTS; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Marche Polytechnic University,x,Italy,,University,Science

Marine nematode taxonomy in Africa: promising prospects against scarcity of information. <i>J. Nematol. 47(3)</i>: 198-206","From the late 19th century, Africa has faced heavy exploitation of its natural resources with increasing land/water pollution, and several described species have already become extinct or close to extinction. This could also be the case for marine nematodes, which are the most abundant and diverse benthic group in marine sediments, and play major roles in ecosystem functioning. Compared to Europe and North America, only a handful of investigations on marine nematodes have been conducted to date in Africa. This is due to the scarcity of experienced taxonomists, absence of identification guides, as well as local appropriate infrastructures. A pivotal project has started recently between nematologists from Africa (Tunisia), India, and Europe (Italy) to promote taxonomic study and biodiversity estimation of marine nematodes in the African continent. To do this, as a first step, collection of permanent slides of marine nematodes (235 nominal species and 14 new to science but not yet described) was recently established at the Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte (Tunisia). Capacity building of next generation of African taxonomists have been carried out at level of both traditional and molecular taxonomy (DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing [NGS]), but they need to be implemented. Indeed, the integration of these two approaches appears crucial to overcome lack of information on the taxonomy, ecology, and biodiversity of marine nematodes from African coastal waters.","Boufahja, F.; Semprucci, F.; Beyrem, H.; Bhadury, P.",,"Boufahja, Fehmi, F.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Africa, barcoding, biodiversity, integrative taxonomy, molecular tools, morphology, next-generation sequencing",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These values are highly comparable to those reported for other Italian TEs, but appear lower than those recorded in other European brackish–water systems, probably in relation to the low salinity range of Lake Varano. Forty taxa were identified up to species level, thus increasing the number of the nematode marine species known for the Italian coasts from 443 to 463, for the Adriatic basin from 310 to 313, and for the Southern Adriatic sector from 37 to 77.

A leading approach to assess coastal pollution is using bioindicators. However, identifying species is time-consum- ing and demands profound morphological knowledge. Our goal was to find the meiobenthic composition in each pollution level. By utilizing the meio-benthic assemblage’s ratios, we will be able to indicate the pollution level. We examined the meiobenthos distribution at three sites exposed to a pollution gradient. We quantified the changes in the fauna assemblage in the commu-nity phylum level, focusing on nematodes and foraminifera (90% of the total population). Over 400 samples were examined, covering an annual seasonal cycle. Nematodes population dominated in the polluted coast. Nematodes density increased with the pollution level, up to seemingly harmful levels of pollution.

This thesis is divided in two chapters. In chaper 1 the space temporal variations of meiofauna structure and Nematoda associations were analysed in beaches with different hydrodynamics at Algodoal Island. (Para). The samplings were made during one year (September/2011, December 2011, March/2012 and June/2012) in three beaches of the island: Caixa d’Agua, Farol and Princesa. The meiofauna was composed by 14 taxons, with Nematoda and Tardigrada as dominant groups. The mean density of meiofauna at Princesa beach was significantly different from Farol beach. The result was attributed to the higher disponibility of food in the intermediate beach (Farol) and the lower disponibility of food and higher waves action in the oceanic dissipative beach (Princesa). All Nematoda descripts (density, richness, eveness and diversity) presented higher values in the protected estuarine beach Caixa d’Agua and lower in the oceanic beach. Considering stations in the beaches, higher densities occured in the middle intertidal zone and lower values in the upper intertidal zone, however richness, eveness and diversity presented maximum values on the lower intertidal zone. 131 Nematoda genera were identified. The nematofauna was significantly different between months and stations in all beaches. Water content, subtrate temperature and proportion of sand were the enviromental variables more related to Nematoda genera. In chapter 2 was verified a taxonomic review and analysys were done to identify the diversity patterns of meiofauna and Nematoda from macrotidal sandy beaches, considering different morphodynamic states and different latitudes: a literature review. Until now 46 Nematoda genera were identified in dissipative beaches, 103 in beach dominated by semi-exposted tide, 82 in protected beach, 80 in beach modified by tide and 82 in ultradissipative beaches. Concerning latitudes, 139 genera were recorded in tropical region and 107 in temperate region.","Melo, T.P.G.",,"Melo, Tatianne, T.P.G.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fauna of the lake and surrounding waters is reviewed, the taxonomic diversity and some zoogeographical and ecological features of the invertebrates are analyzed. The lake system includes from freshwater to hyper-saline basins with fast changing environment. A total of 6 types, 10 classes, 35 orders, 82 families and 157 species are known from the Atanasovsko Lake and the surrounding basins. They include 56 species (35.7%) marine and marine-brackish forms and 101 species (64.3%) brackish-freshwater, freshwater and terrestrial forms, connected with water. For the first time, 23 species in this study are established (12 marine, 1 brackish and 10 freshwater). The marine and marine- brackish species have 4 types of ranges – Cosmopolitan, Atlantic-Indian, Atlantic-Pacific and Atlantic. The Atlantic (66.1%) and Cosmopolitan (23.2%) ranges that include 80% of the species, predominate. Most of the fauna (over 60%) has an Atlantic-Mediterranean origin and represents an impoverished Atlantic-Mediterranean fauna. The freshwater-brackish, freshwater and terrestrial forms, connected with water, that have been established from the Atanasovsko Lake, have 2 main types of ranges – species, distributed in the Palaearctic and beyond it and species, distributed only in the Palaearctic. The representatives of the first type (52.4%) predominate. They are related to the typical marine coastal habitats, optimal for the development of certain species. The second type combines Palaearctic (20.0%), Eurosiberian (9.5%) and Mediterranean (15.2%) taxa. Caspian relicts lack in the Atanasovsko Lake. That is probably related to the specific hydrological regime, technological processes of the salt producing and the highly variable hyper-saline nature of the lake. Of the Pontic species <i>Chironomus valkanovi</i> is established. Of the benthic forms <i>Cerastoderma glaucum</i> (to 134376 ind/m<sup>2</sup>), <i>Ecrobia ventrosa</i> (to 19800 ind/m<sup>2</sup>), <i>Abra segmentum</i> and <i>Cyprideis torosa</i> (to 77440 ind/m<sup>2</sup>) dominate. <i>Corophium volutator</i> is a mass species in all seasons and is one of the most adapted inhabitants of the saltpans. The Cosmopolitan <i>Acartia clausi</i> reaches high numbers (to 130000 ind/m<sup>3</sup>) as well. Typical for the Atanasovsko Lake are the halobionts <i>Artemia parthenogenetica</i> and <i>Artemia salina</i> that reach densities up to 3400 ind/l water. The presence of 6 types of foreign immigrants (<i>Ficopomatus enigmaticus, Amphibalanus eburneus, Rapana venosa, Physella acuta, Anadara kagoshimensis</i> and <i>Mya arenaria</i>) is established.

The patterns were described based on species identity and biological traits. Species richness was similar across depth horizons ranging from 12 to 18 species; it was also similar between sites with 30 and 33 species for Bacunayagua and Miramar respectively. Diversity variation was higher between the intertidal and the subtidal horizons suggesting that microhabitat plays a key role. Depth was not an important driver of the diversity of nematodes on the studied rocky shores both in terms of species richness and diversity variation. The type of microhabitat and the hydrodynamics may explain the β-diversity patterns within sites. The site-related diversity variation was larger than the depth-related variation suggesting that a regional pattern in β-diversity may be present. The biological traits constituted a useful complementary approach for analyzing diversity patterns indicating the prevalence of nematodes adapted to an epiphytic life-style and the effects of two putative diversity drivers: microhabitat and hydrodynamics.","Armenteros, M.; del Pino-Machado, A.; González-González, S.; Ruiz-Abierno, A.; Pérez-García, J.A.",,"del Pino-Machado, Arturo, A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,"nematodes, biological traits, species composition, a-diversity, ß-diversity, Caribbean Sea, Cuba",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions between algae and nematodes: habitat provision and detrital driven processes. PhD Thesis. University of Southampton: Southampton.  174 pp.","The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate marine nematode-algae interactions using a twofold approach: habitat provision by algae and the role of algal detritus in structuring nematode assemblages. Nematode assemblages living in algae on the south and east coast of Korea were compared using a hierarchical sampling design with those from the south coast of the British Isles in order to investigate nematode diversity and functional traits at different spatial scales (patch, shore, region and biogeographic realm). The cosmopolitan genus Corallina and Sargassum muticum, a native of Korea and an invader in the British Isles were investigated as algal habitat providers for nematodes. The species composition and functional traits of nematode assemblage in both species of macroalgae were significantly different at all spatial scales. The alpha, beta and gamma biodiversity of nematodes in each macroalgae were also measured at all spatial scales. The alpha, beta and gamma diversity of nematodes across four spatial scales in two different habitats are an alpha dominant relationship indicating random colonization and high species turnover at small scales.     Nematode species composition and diversity on the wrack-loaded sandy shore were explored using field experiments. Mesh bags filled with three different types of macroalgae (brown, green and red) were used to test the effects of diversity of algal detritus on nematode assemblages involved in decomposition processes. The detrital treatments consisted of 10 combinations of macroalgae (monoculture, two and three species treatments), containing different proportions of algal material in order to test the impacts of detrital diversity on nematode assemblages. The density, diversity and species composition of nematodes in combinations of algae were higher than with single types of macroalgae. This indicated that the combination of two algae mixtures offered more favourable environments than the single species bags. Overall this thesis demonstrated the high diversity of nematodes inhabiting seaweeds and the role of detrital composition in driving nematode assemblages.","Kim, H.-G.",,"Kim, Hyeong-Gi, H.-G.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

From chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration and zooplankton biovolume perspective mesotrophic conditions prevailed in comparison with the Gulf of California during November. Crustaceans numerically dominated the zooplankton assemblage (92.3%) [Copepoda (79.2%), Decapoda larvae (4.7%), Cladocera (3.7%), Mysidacea (2.7%), and Euphausiacea (2.0%)]. The other 15 taxonomic groups (7.7% combined) accounted each one less than 1.5% of the relative abundance. Species richness of selected taxa (~56%&gt;) included 259 taxa (121 identified to species, 117 to genus, and 21 not identified). Tropical species from neritic affinity clearly dominated zooplankton assemblage around IMA. Five tropical Copepoda species [<i>Calanopia minor</i> (Dana), <i>Clausocalanus jobei</i> Frost <i>&amp;</i> Fleminger, <i>Acrocalanus gibber</i> Giesbrecht, <i>Canthocalanus pauper</i> (Giesbrecht), and <i>Centropages furcatus</i> (Dana)], a cladoceran <i>Pseudevadne tergestina</i> (Claus), and a Mysidacea species (<i>Mysidium reckettsi</i> Harrison <i>&amp;</i> Bowman) dominated the zooplankton assemblage (accounting about 55% of total abundance of the identified species). Except <i>C. furcatus,</i> all these species are not abundant at oceanic regions of the central and northern Gulf of California. The similarity of multiple neritic and tropical species in the zooplankton assemblage from IMA and Cape Corrientes suggests strong coastal-insular plankton connectivity. Episodic current plumes associated with anomalous intense rivers discharge during rainy years, eddies generated by coastal upwelling event that move offshore, and northward regional oceanic circulation are the most likely mesoscale oceanographic processes that cause costal tropical zooplankton drift enhancing coastal-Archipelago species connectivity in this region.","Gómez-Gutiérrez, J.; Funes-Rodríguez, R.; Arroyo-Ramírez, K.; Sánchez-Ortiz, C.A.; Beltrán-Castro, J.R.; Hernández-Trujillo, S.; Palomares-García, R.; Aburto-Oropeza, O.; Ezcurra, E.",WOS:000347406200007,"Gómez-Gutiérrez, Jaime, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3856/vol42-issue5-fulltext-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"zooplankton, assemblage, zooplankton biovolume, neritic, tropical, Islas Marías Archipelago, Mexico",Journal article,,,"Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Av Inst Politecn Nacl S-N,Col Palo Santa Rita, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico.",Mexico,zooplankton; assemblage; zooplankton biovolume; neritic; tropical; Islas Marias Archipelago; Mexico,GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; COPEPOD COMMUNITY; FISH LARVAE; PACIFIC; CRUSTACEA; BAHIA; IDENTIFICATION; CIRCULATION,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

However, despite incomplete knowledge of the environmental mechanisms involved, the LCA community (researchers and practitioners) is calling for methodological developments to close this gap. We present a preliminary effect factor (EF) for working towards including the impacts of entanglement in plastic waste on marine biodiversity in life cycle assessment (LCA).Our preliminary EF modelling approach couples spatially-differentiated and taxon-specific estimates of the current fraction of species affected by entanglement with spatially-differentiated floating macroplastic density estimates. Our results indicate that the effect of macroplastic density on the fraction of species potential affected by entanglement is highest in areas with low estimated plastic density, most prominently the Southern Ocean and equatorial Pacific. However, in parameterising our approach, we discovered trade-offs between data source options, e.g. species coverage versus range extent accuracy. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps, e.g. defining species sensitivity effect thresholds to enable statistically relating pressure (density of floating marine macroplastic) with effect (the potentially affected fraction of species), and set out options for future methodological development for achieving quantification of an effect factor ready for incorporation in to a life cycle impact assessment modelling approach.","Woods, J.S.; Rødder, G.; Verones, F.",WOS:000470960400007,"Woods, John, J.S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.12.018,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,Plastic waste; Entanglement; Marine biodiversity; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Impact; Spatial differentiation,Journal article,,,"Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Sem Saelands Vei 7, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",Norway,Plastic waste; Entanglement; Marine biodiversity; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Impact; Spatial differentiation,PLASTIC DEBRIS; ACCUMULATION; HITCHHIKING; CHALLENGES; COASTAL,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Accordingly, this study investigates the number, characteristics, and distribution of BCs responsible for the development of coastal three‐dimensional structures in Taiwan. A total of 89 transects among three regions (north, east, and south) and two depths (−10 and −40 m) were characterized using a morpho‐functional categorization of benthic organisms. Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, k‐means cluster, an optimal number of k groups were identified among transects in order to minimize total intra‐group variance and represent a first level of organization, mirroring the number of BCs. Each BC was then described into prevailing categories and typified by an association with significant indicator groups. Their distributions were further examined and tested among regions and depths. Seven BCs were identified as having different composition and indicator categories. Their distributions suggest that, while sea surface temperature and light regime may be associated with a panel of available BCs, local conditions may have the final say on whether a BC eventually thrives at a given location. Overall, this study proposes an innovative and simple analytical framework for acknowledging differences among BCs. Our results encourage greater consideration of these shades in coral reef ecology studies, as they could conceal a variety of roles and dynamics important for the conservation of these endangered ecosystems.","Lin, Y.V.; Denis, V.",WOS:000477912900005,"Denis, Vianney, V.","Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ecs2.2803,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,coral reefs; depth gradient; functionality; high-latitude; marginality; mesophotic; statistical learning,Journal article,,,"Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",Taiwan,coral reefs; depth gradient; functionality; high-latitude; marginality; mesophotic; statistical learning,CORAL-REEF; FISH PREDATION; HIGH-LATITUDE; SODWANA BAY; PHASE-SHIFT; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ASSEMBLAGES; MACROALGAE; COMPLEXITY,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there is little basic knowledge about this group of species, particularly in Mexico. This study aimed to determine the relative abundance, spatial distribution, bathymetric distribution, and habitat preference of the snail Conus princeps along the southern coast of Jalisco (Mexico). To achieve this goal, we conducted direct samplings by snorkeling or scuba diving at 13 beaches, covering the intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal zones. Relative density was between 0.021 and 0.418 snails per 100 m<sup>2</sup>, with an average value of 0.152 snails per 100 m<sup>2</sup>. The population showed an aggregated spatial distribution pattern according to the nearest neighbor index. Snails had shells that measured between 23.1 mm and 52.2 mm long, with an average shell size of 39.7 mm. <i>Conus princeps</i> was mainly distributed in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. The smaller organisms were present at shallower depths, while the larger organisms were distributed throughout the sampled depth habitats. In general, snail abundance decreased as depth increased.

These variables can affect the species abundance at different temporal scales. In the present study our goal was to evaluate the community changes over the years using different temporal scales (fortnightly, monthly, seasonal and annual) as a tool to understand the effects of biotic (i.e. competition or facilitation) and abiotic drivers (i.e. water temperature, air temperature, tidal regime, rainfall and water quality) in abundance pattern of dominant species (Crassostrea rhizophorae, Saccostrea cuccullata, Tetraclita stalactifera and Amphibalanus amphitrite). The samples were seasonally carried out in the mid-intertidal zone in the Boa Viagem Beach in Guanabara Bay over 7 years (2010 July - 2017 June). From June 2015 to June 2017 fortnightly samplings were made in addition to seasonal sampling. The inter-annual scale was the main scale in which the differences in the percent cover of the benthic community was noted (pseudo-F = 15.96, p = 0.0001). Hierarchical ANOVA indicated that for the dominant species only the annual scale was significant while to the cryptogenic macroalgae Ulva spp. only the seasonal scale. Among the environmental variables selected, dbRDA indicated 6 of them that were significantly relevant to percent cover variation of all species explaining 86,61% of data variation (p < 0.05). While C. rhizophorae e S. cucullata and T. stalactifera exhibited similar response to the relevant environmental variables, A. amphitrite exhibited opposite response to these variables. The species responded to abiotic drivers in different temporal scales. Water temperature was a very important variable, but its effect in the population dynamics of these long-lived species needs long time scales (60 days) to manifest responses at detectable levels as well as the biotic interactions, such as competition, and the effects of bioinvasion. The niche overlap observed among S. cucullata and C. rhizophorae with A. amphitrite was highly significantly (p < 0.001) (i.e.,negative SES). Conversely for the oyster species the observed niche overlap is greater than the niche overlap expected by chance (i.e., SES positive). Environmentally constrained null model approach showed a significant (p = 0.004) relationship only between A. amphitrite and S. cucullata (C-score obs = 1200; C-score exp = 716.6), indicating a negative association. During this long and continuous monitoring, we verified that each environmental variable affects the same species at distinct temporal scales, affecting also some biotic interactions (S. cucullata × A. amphitrite) and consequently the community structure.","Puga, C.A.; Torres, A.S.S.; Paiva, P.C.; Yoneshigue-Valentin, Y.; Junqueira, A.O.R.",WOS:000482495700019,"Yoneshigue-Valentin, Yocie, Y.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Zool, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106265,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Rocky shore; Benthic community; Temporal variation; Bioinvasion; Guanabara bay; Monitoring,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Biol Marinha, Lab Bentos, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",Brazil,Rocky shore; Benthic community; Temporal variation; Bioinvasion; Guanabara bay; Monitoring,BARNACLE BALANUS-AMPHITRITE; LONG-TERM CHANGES; OYSTER SACCOSTREA-CUCULLATA; BIVALVE ISOGNOMON-BICOLOR; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; TETRACLITA-STALACTIFERA; FOOD CONCENTRATION; MANGROVE OYSTER; SANTOS BAY; TEMPERATURE,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - Department of Zoology - Institute of Biology,,,,,

In many lakes and reservoirs, guanotrophication occurs when roosting waterbirds import nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from surrounding terrestrial habitats. To date, nutrient loading by waterbirds has been estimated based on censuses in the absence of detailed information on their movements. We quantified nutrient importation by the lesser black‐backed gull (<i>Larus fuscus</i>) to Fuente de Piedra (1,350 ha) in Andalusia (south‐west Spain), where an average of 36,288 individuals are counted in January. 2.During seven winters from 2010 to 2017, we used movement data from 20 individual gulls tagged with Global Positioning System trackers that foraged in four landfills. Together with monthly bird counts and measurements of total N and P content in faeces and pellet samples, movement data were used to quantify the total external loading effect for different winters. Movement data allowed us to quantify the proportion of time spent in the lake and the time spent at different foraging sites and enabled correction of censuses.3.According to tracking data, on average 69% of the birds had already left the lake to head for feeding sites when waterbird counts were carried out. Nutrient inputs to the lake depend partly on the proportion of the day that gulls spend there, which was higher in late winters and was reduced when lake depth went below or above 20–35 cm. An estimated average of 10.17 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> and 2.07 kg P ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> were imported to this closed‐basin lake by gulls each winter, with highest values recorded in winter 2016–2017. 4.Gull guano is the most important winter source of nutrients to the lake. Regurgitated pellets have been ignored as a source of nutrients in other guanotrophy studies, but we found them to be a more important source of P than faeces. A movement ecology approach complements traditional censuses and facilitates the study of guanotrophication in multiple ways, including identification of sources of nutrients, correction of censuses, and measuring time spent at roost sites.","Martín-Vélez, V.; Sánchez, M.I.; Shamoun-Baranes, J.; Thaxter, C.B.; Stienen, E.W.M.; Camphuysen, K.C.J.; Green, A.J.",WOS:000479828300001,"Martín-Vélez, Víctor, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/fwb.13374,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,"Larus fuscus Linnaeus, 1758",,,Global Positioning System; guanotrophication; landfills; waterbirds,Journal article,,,"CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville, Spain.",Spain,Global Positioning System; guanotrophication; landfills; Larus fuscus; waterbirds,YELLOW-LEGGED GULL; SOUTHEASTERN BAY; SURFACE-WATER; LANDFILL; NITROGEN; DONANA; FUENTE; PIEDRA; BIRDS; POPULATION,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Each taxonomic group is briefly introduced, followed by a synopsis on some of the outstanding contributions within that group. Knowledge development is followed, from the first parasites discovered to other historical highlights that influenced the groups up to this point. Other important discoveries (both taxonomic and ecological) are also noted, serving as a preview to the host-parasite interactions covered in the subsequent chapters. Additionally, several researchers who have added significant contributions to our knowledge of the parasitic Crustacea (specifically in taxonomy and discovery) are introduced, along with photographs of a select few.

In the ocean, they are associated with almost all the invertebrate phyla and the vertebrate classes of fish, reptiles, birds and marine mammals. In freshwater, the crustacean associations are mainly with fish and some amphibian tadpoles. In almost every order of the Crustacea, there are species in some kind of association with other species. Associations range from facultative to highly specialised parasitism where the parasite undergoes total morphological adaptation, becoming metabolically completely reliant on the host for its survival. The crustacean associations are grouped into six categories: epibiosis, inquilinism, commensalism, mutualism, parasitism and eusociality. The most diverse category, parasitism, is subdivided into ectoparasites, mesoparasites, endoparasites, parasitic castrators, parasitoidism and sponge hotels, the latter to accommodate the complex crustacean association with sponges. In the category eusociality, the social behaviour of snapping shrimps is examined. The concluding sections discuss some interesting observations and deductions on parasitic crustacean parasite adaptations and associations using the subclass Branchiura, of which all the species are parasites of fish and amphibian tadpoles, as a case study due to the available information and expertise of the authors on this group.","Van As, J.G.; van As, L.L.",,"Van As, Jo, J.G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-17385-2_4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet in nature, habitats are interconnected through the exchange of energy and organisms, and the responses of local communities may not extend to emerging community networks (i.e., metacommunities). Using large mesocosms and meiofauna communities as a model system, we investigated the interactive effects of ocean warming and acidification on the structure of marine metacommunities from three shallow‐water habitats: sandy soft‐bottoms, marine vegetation, and rocky reef substrates. Primary producers and detritus—key food sources for meiofauna—increased in biomass under the combined effect of temperature and acidification. The enhanced bottom‐up forcing boosted nematode densities but impoverished the functional and trophic diversity of nematode metacommunities. The combined climate stressors further homogenized meiofauna communities across habitats. Under present‐day conditions metacommunities were structured by habitat type, but under future conditions they showed an unstructured random pattern with fast‐growing generalist species dominating the communities of all habitats. Homogenization was likely driven by local species extinctions, reducing interspecific competition that otherwise could have prevented single species from dominating multiple niches. Our findings reveal that climate change may simplify metacommunity structure and prompt biodiversity loss, which may affect the biological organization and resilience of marine communities.","Brustolin, M.C.; Nagelkerken, I.; Ferreira, C.M.; Goldenberg, S.U.; Ullah, H.; Fonseca, G.",WOS:000478340200001,"Ullah, Hadayet, H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.14745,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,beta-diversity; climate change; meiofauna; mesocosms; metacommunities; ocean acidification; seascape heterogeneity,Journal article,,,"Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Australia,beta-diversity; climate change; meiofauna; mesocosms; metacommunities; ocean acidification; seascape heterogeneity,METAZOAN MEIOFAUNA; ELEVATED CO2; TEMPERATURE; ACIDIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; TURNOVER; EXPOSURE; IMPACTS; SHIFTS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

However, online biodiversity information are biased (Boakes et al. 2010, Stropp et al. 2016) as a result of the relatively slow capture and digitization of existing data resources. The West African Plants (WAP) initiative approach to data capture is a prototype of a novel solution to the challenge of the traditional model, in which the institutional “owner” of the specimens is responsible for digital capture of associated data. The WAP Initiative is a consortium of West African researchers in botany, in coordination with six institutions across Europe and North America; its goal is to digitize and mobilize available, high-quality, primary biodiversity occurrence data resources for West African plant diversity (http://jrsbiodiversity.org/grants/university-of-ghana-herbaria/). Here, we developed customized workflows for data capture in formats directly and permanently useful to the “owner” herbarium, and digitized significant new biodiversity records adding to the information available for the plants of the region. Data records were captured strictly in accordance with DarwinCore standards, achieved either by (a) capturing data records from existing images (e.g., images supplied by Naturalis Bodiversity Centre), or (b) capturing data from images taken quickly and efficiently by project personnel in West African Herbaria. Digitization of images and data began in 2015 in West African partner institutions, and by middle of 2018 resulted in 190,953 records of species in 1965 genera and 331 families from 16 West African countries (Fig. 1). Our approach is cost-effective, allows development of information resources even for regions in which political situations make it impossible, and it provides a historical context against which to compare newer data as the latter become available (Peterson et al. 2016). Further measures of success of the initiative will center on whether the institutions “owning” the specimens follow through and put the new data records online. Already, several project institutions have put initial project data online as part of their GBIF data contributions, but—of course—success would consist of all project-generated data being completely available online. Note that this model is the reverse of the traditional model, in which the institutions holding the specimens create the information resources that are used by the rest of the world. This new paradigm in specimen digitization has considerable promise to accelerate and improve the process of generating biodiversity information, and can be replicated and applied in many biodiversity-rich, information-poor regions to remedy the oft-cited massive gaps in information availability.","Asase, A.; Sainge, M.; Radji, R.; Ugbogu, O.; Townsend Peterson, A.",,"Sainge, Moses, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/biss.3.37340,,"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,"primary biodiversity data, plants, biodiversity informatics, digitization, West Africa",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a survey of the freshwater diatom flora of Macquarie Island (southern Pacific Ocean), an unknown <i>Navicula</i> species was observed showing resemblance to <i>Navicula gottlandica</i>. Populations of similar diatoms (previously reported as <i>N. gottlandica</i>) from Tasmania were also investigated. We here present a detailed morphological analysis of these diatoms, and compare it with the type material of <i>N. gottlandica</i>. Methods –Materials were analysed using Light and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Key results –The southern hemisphere populations represent two hitherto unknown taxa here described as <i>Navicula bergstromiana</i> and <i>N. eileencoxiana</i>. Important morphological differences include valve shape, stria density, shape of the central area, ultrastructure of the external central raphe endings, presence of a distinct internal accessory rib, and the relative width of the external longitudinal silica strips covering the valve face with respect to the longitudinal fissures separating these strips. While the new taxa show some affinity with the genus Haslea, the internal apical structure of the raphe, the external structure of the terminal raphe fissures and the central raphe endings (often with tooth-like protrusions, creating the impression of a satellite pore), and the apparent lack of the typical sandwich-type Haslea valve ultrastructure support the position of <i>N. gottlandica</i> and both new taxa within the genus <i>Navicula</i>.  Conclusions – The description of two additional species with close similarities to <i>N. gottlandica</i> (i.e. possessing the typical longitudinal striae/silica strips and tooth-like protrusions in hooked central raphe endings) suggests that the <i>N. gottlandica</i> species group is more diverse than previously thought. The existence of closely similar Navicula species recently described from rivers in tropical South America but also from marine littoral samples in South and North America and China, raises intriguing questions about their phylogenetic relationships, ecology and biogeography.","Sabbe, K.; Vyverman, W.; Ector, L.; Wetzel, C.E.; John, J.; Hodgson, D.A.; Verleyen, E.; Van de Vijver, B.",WOS:000475963600016,"Ector, Luc, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5091/plecevo.2019.1607,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Tasmania,"Bacillariophyta, ""Haslea"", ""Navicula""","Diatoms, ""New taxa""",,Tasmania; subantarctic,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Protistol & Aquat Ecol Lab, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Tasmania; subantarctic; Bacillariophyta; diatoms; Navicula; Haslea; new taxa,BENTHIC DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES; ISLAND; LAKES,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,,,,,,

Freshwater unionid mussels (Unionida) are important ecosystem engineers, and one of the most globally imperilled taxa, yet evidence concerning their endosymbiotic fauna remains patchy. Further, endosymbionts are not considered in an IUCN assessment for any unionid mussel. Here, we conduct the first literature review of all endosymbionts of the 16 extant European and 279 extant North American unionids, in addition to the four most significant invasive bivalves in Europe. There were 1476 host-endosymbiont records from 239 different studies over a 168-year period, documenting at least 188 unique endosymbiont taxa. However, study effort was uneven in its distribution, with 53% of unionid species (n = 157) having no endosymbiont records. Eighty-eight percent of all hosts are considered under-sampled, including 99% of Endangered or Critically Endangered mussels. This is of significant concern given that when the effects of endosymbionts were examined, 72% showed potentially negative effects on their host, including complete castration in the case of digenean trematodes. However, only a small number of endosymbionts have had their effects quantified. Bipartite network analyses revealed invasive mussels may be competent for native parasites. This leads to the potential for parasite spillback, with conservation implications for vulnerable native species. Recommendations for future work include greater sampling of sympatric native and invasive populations (including non-destructive sampling of endangered species) and experimental manipulation of host-endosymbiont communities. This will facilitate better conservation outcomes for this crucial group of ecosystem engineers.","Brian, J.I.; Aldridge, D.C.",WOS:000488314700018,"Brian, Joshua, J.I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.06.037,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Dreissena Van Beneden, 1835",,,Endosymbiont; Enemy release; Invasion; Parasite; Unionid,Journal article,,,"Univ Cambridge, Aquat Ecol Grp, Dept Zool, David Attenborough Bldg, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England.",England,Dreissena; Endosymbiont; Enemy release; Invasion; Parasite; Unionid,ANODONTA-PISCINALIS BIVALVIA; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; ZEBRA MUSSELS; RHIPIDOCOTYLE-FENNICA; PARASITE SPILLBACK; HOST-SPECIFICITY; UNIONIDAE; UNIONICOLA; ACARI; RIVER,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Cambridge,x,UK,,University,Science

The interactions in respective social-ecological systems are usually of complex nature, due to a wide range of different fisheries interacting with the ecosystem. Understanding connectivity within these systems (i.e. among social and ecological actors) helps in establishing meaningful management strategies for sustainable use of marine resources. This work uses the value chain analysis of different fisheries sectors to construct a qualitative social-ecological network (SEN) model of the Sechura Bay in North Peru. Here, a diverse ensemble of small-scale fisheries co-exists with a flourishing mariculture sector, though the respective production chains partially overlap. Directed and unweighted links between actors were defined based on the transfer of biomass (trophic interactions) and money (economic interactions). Several analytical network tools were applied (e.g. degree centrality, dominator tree) to identify the most important nodes of the social-ecological network and to understand interdependencies. Results of the network analysis suggest position of system's components being related to their vulnerability in the face of external disturbances. Fisher groups with a high specialization with respect to fisheries target species were stronger impacted by the last strong El Niño event (the Coastal El Niño 2017), with drastic consequences for actors of the respective production chains. The present approach is envisioned to be applicable beyond this particular case study and to nourish on-going scientific discussions on the use of social-ecological network analysis to describe human-nature interactions. This study allows (i) estimating node (actor) susceptibilities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and (ii) reconciling sustainable resource use and nature conservation by enhancing the understanding of the functionality of the respective social-ecological system.","Kluger, L.C.; Scotti, M.; Vivar, I.; Wolff, M.",WOS:000486105500026,"Wolff, Matthias, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104861,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Social-ecological network analysis; Small-scale resource management; Value chain analysis; Vulnerability; Fisheries sustainability,Journal article,,,"Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",Germany,Social-ecological network analysis; Small-scale resource management; Value chain analysis; Vulnerability; Fisheries sustainability,ECOSYSTEM; ECOPATH; ECOSIM; FLOW,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT),x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Our current knowledge of BEF relies heavily on theoretical and experimental studies, typically conducted on a narrow range of spatio-temporal scales, environmental conditions, and trophic levels. Hence, whether a relationship holds in the natural environment is poorly understood, especially in exploited marine ecosystems. Using large-scale observations of marine fish communities, we applied a structural equation modelling framework to investigate the existence and significance of BEF relationships across northwestern European seas. We find that ecosystem functioning, here represented by spatial patterns in total fish biomass, is unrelated to species richness—the most commonly used diversity metric in BEF studies. Instead, community evenness, differences in species composition, and abiotic variables are significant drivers. In particular, we find that high fish biomass is associated with fish assemblages dominated by a few generalist species of a high trophic level, who are able to exploit both the benthic and pelagic energy pathway. Our study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms behind marine ecosystem functioning and allows for the integration of biodiversity into management considerations.","Maureaud, A.; Hodapp, D.; van Denderen, P.; Hillebrand, H.; Gislason, H.; Spaanheden Dencker, T.; Beukhof, E.D.; Lindegren, M.",WOS:000475797600020,"Maureaud, Aurore, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1098/rspb.2019.1189,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Bldg 202, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",Denmark,fish biodiversity; ecosystem functioning; biomass; BEF relationship; dominance,NORTH-SEA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; TURNOVER; COMPLEMENTARITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; EFFICIENCY; DOMINANCE,Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,

With the available nanotechnology, studies suggested that marine drugs hold tremendous promise to bring forth novel medicines for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases, but unfortunately this promise has yet to be fully realized. Deadliest diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and neurological disorders, just to mention few, can be halted by using marine nanopharmaceuticals, which are cost-effective natural products. Legal and scientific frameworks have to be in place with full support from global human health communities to create a unique set of opportunities in the cause of biodiscovery and marine drug development processes.","Macha, I.J.; Ben-Nissan, B.; Müller, W.H.; Cazalbou, S.",,"Ben-Nissan, Besim, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-981-13-8855-2_10,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Marine nanopharmaceuticals; Anti-cancer; Anti-HIV/AIDS; Neurological disorders; Multiple sclerosis ,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1931) 280(9)</i>: 1405-1444. <a href=""https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/jmor.21040"" target=""_blank"">https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/jmor.21040</a>","This article reviews the morphogenesis, morphology, histology, ultrastructure, and structural–functional relationships of the hepatopancreas, the main metabolic organ of the Decapoda. The hepatopancreas develops in early larval stages from a pair of lateral lobes of the midgut anlage. In adults, it consists of hundreds of blindly ending tubules that are enveloped by a muscle net consisting of longitudinal and circular fibers. Stem cells at the distal ends of the tubules give rise to three ultrastructurally different epithelial cell types, the R‐, F‐, and B‐cells. Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and monitoring of ultrastructural changes under different experimental conditions allowed the attribution of functions to these cell types. R‐cells serve for the absorption and metabolization of nutrients, storage of energy reserves and minerals, synthesis of lipoproteins for export to other organs, detoxification of heavy metals, and excretion of uric acid. F‐cells synthesize digestive enzymes and blood proteins involved in oxygen transport and immune defense. They also detoxify some heavy metals and probably organic xenobiotics. B‐cells are assumed to produce and recycle fat emulsifiers. The hepatopancreas tubules lack nerves. The presence of scattered M‐cells with putative endocrine function in the epithelium suggests that the hepatopancreas is mainly hormonally controlled. M‐cells probably represent a self‐perpetuating cell lineage independent from E‐cells. The interstitium between the tubules contains connective tissue, arterioles, hemolymph with circulating hemocytes, and fixed phagocytes that eliminate pathogens. The hepatopancreas is histologically and ultrastructurally uniform throughout the Decapoda, despite their broad variety in body size, morphology, life style, and ecology. However, in a few cavernicolous and deep‐sea shrimps parts of the hepatopancreas are transformed into large oil storing and bioluminescent compartments. Within the malacostracan crustaceans, the hepatopancreas of the Decapoda is most similar to the digestive gland of the Euphausiacea, supporting close taxonomic relationship of these two taxa.","Vogt, G.",WOS:000475088500001,"Vogt, Günter, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/jmor.21040,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Decapoda,"Digestive system, ""Functions"", ""Morphology"", ""Organogenesis"", ""Ultrastructure""",,,Journal article,,,"Heidelberg Univ, Fac Biosci, Neuenheimer Feld 234, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Germany,Decapoda; digestive system; functions; morphology; organogenesis; ultrastructure,PENAEUS-SEMISULCATUS CRUSTACEA; FRESH-WATER CRAYFISH; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; PALAEMONETES-ARGENTINUS CRUSTACEA; CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE GRANULES; PANULIRUS-ARGUS LATREILLE; FINE-STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS; PACIFIC WHITE SHRIMP; CRAB CARCINUS-MAENAS; CHINESE MITTEN CRAB,Anatomy & Morphology,Anatomy & Morphology,,,,,,

This new species, <i>Syndesmis kurakaikina</i> n. sp., is morphologically distinct and can easily be recognised by its very long (±1 mm) stylet and its bright-red colour. In addition to providing a formal description, we present some observations on reproduction and life history of this new species. Fecundity is comparable to that of other umagillids and the rate of egg production and development increases with temperature. Hatching in this species is induced by intestinal fluids of its host. Relevant to global warming, we assessed the effect of temperature on survival, fecundity, and development. The tests indicate that Syndesmis kurakaikina n. sp. is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures (11–25 °C) and that its temperature optimum lies between 18.0 and 21.5 °C. Egg viability is, however, significantly compromised at the higher end of this temperature range, with expelled egg capsules often being deformed and showing increasingly lower rates of hatching.

For the first time since their implementation, this review took a close look at the existing literature in the field of deep-sea trophic ecology to synthesize current knowledge. Furthermore, it provided an opportunity for a preliminary analysis of global geographic (i.e., latitudinal, along a depth gradient) trends in the isotopic (δ15N, δ13C) and fatty acid composition of deep-sea macro- and megafauna from heterotrophic systems. Results revealed significant relationships along the latitudinal and bathymetric gradients. Deep-sea animals sampled at temperate and polar latitudes displayed lower isotopic ratios and greater proportions of essential ω3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) than did tropical counterparts. Furthermore, δ15N and δ13C ratios as well as proportions of arachidonic acid increased with increasing depth. Since similar latitudinal trends in the isotopic and fatty acid composition were found in surface water phytoplankton and particulate organic matter, these results highlight the link across latitudes between surface primary production and deep-water communities. Because global climate change may affect quantity and quality (e.g., levels of essential ω3 PUFAs) of surface primary productivity, and by extension those of its downward flux, the dietary intake of deep-sea organisms may likely be altered. In addition, because essential ω3 PUFAs play a major role in the response to temperature variations, climate change may interfere with the ability of deep-sea species to cope with potential temperature shifts. Importantly, methodological disparities were highlighted that prevented in-depth analyses, indicating that further studies should be conducted using standardized methods in order to generate more reliable global predictions.","Parzanini, C.; Parrish, C.C.; Hamel, J.-F.; Mercier, A.",WOS:000475864900002,"Parzanini, Camilla, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5194/bg-16-2837-2019,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Mem Univ, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada.",Canada,,NORTHEAST PACIFIC-OCEAN; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE; MESOPELAGIC FISHES; BENTHIC COMMUNITY; STOMACH CONTENT; LIPID CLASSES; KURIL BASIN; BODY-SIZE; CARBON; ATLANTIC,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Memorial University of Newfoundland - Department of Ocean Science,x,Canada,,University,Science

Additionally, Scaphander lignarius and S. bathymophilus are suggested to be a complex of cryptic species.

We compared these 2 lagoons to an oligotrophic coastal lagoon. Using bioassays comprising 24 h incubations with added phosphorus and/or ammonium, we investigated the response of the phytoplankton communities to nutrient enrichment during summer in terms of biomass, size class structure, abundance and growth. For nitrogen and phosphorus, we identified which nutrient limited phytoplankton growth, and what strategies of nutrient exploitation the communities adopted to cope with these limitations. Ultraphytoplankton dominated the 3 communities, but it differed in composition among the lagoons. Green algae dominated in the hypertrophic lagoon, whereas the mesotrophic lagoon presented a higher diversity of phytoplankton groups. Picocyanobacteria and small diatoms were the most abundant groups in the oligotrophic lagoon, although they accounted for less biomass than green algae. The communities of the mesotrophic and the hypertrophic lagoons strongly responded to the nutrient pulse, showing that the re-oligotrophication trajectories of these lagoons were still very vulnerable to occasional eutrophication events. On the other hand, the oligotrophic lagoon marginally responded to the enrichment, indicating its adaptation to nutrient-depleted conditions. We observed a shift along the eutrophication gradient, from a co-limitation by N and P in the oligotrophic and the mesotrophic lagoons to a single and strong N limitation in the hypertrophic lagoon. Each community demonstrated specific use of internal, external or recycled nutrient pools under experimentally induced limitation.","Leruste, A.; Guilhaumon, F.; De Wit, R.; Malet, N.; Collos, Y.; Bec, B.",WOS:000487116100003,"Guilhaumon, François, F.","CNRS, IRD, IFREMER, Lab Ecol Syst Marins Cotiers,UMR 5119,UM2,ECOSYM, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/ame01906,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Growth rate,,Nutrient limitation; Dilution experiment; HPLC,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, MARine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, IRD, Ifremer,CNRS, Bat 24,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France.",France,Growth rate; Nutrient limitation; Dilution experiment; HPLC,FRESH-WATER; THAU LAGOON; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GROWTH-RATE; MARINE; LAKE; RESPONSES; NITROGEN; PICOCYANOBACTERIA,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Microbiology,"Joint Research Unit: Biodiversité Marine, Exploitation et Conservation (MARBEC) (UMR 9190)",,France,,Research network,Science

However, only 10 have been molecularly ascertained as to the phylogenetic position. Based on seven mitochondrial gene markers (16S rRNA, COI, tRNA-Ala, tRNA-Leu, tRNA-Asn, tRNA-Gln, and tRNA-Pro), we performed molecular analyses to assess the monophyly of Setihenricia using 16 species of Henricia from Japanese waters, as well as other congeners for which sequences were available in public databases. The monophyletic Setihenricia was only weakly recovered because the support values were low, but we assume this taxon may be valid in consideration of a morphological key. Henricia kinkasana Hayashi, 1940 is herein identified as a new member of Setihenricia, based on molecular and morphological evidence. Sequences in the public databases previously identified as H. compacta (Sladen, 1889) and H. obesa (Sladen, 1889) were nested in the Setihenricia clade; these two species are also likely members of Setihenricia. Our morphological assessment yielded three findings: (1) the number of the rows of spines on each inferomarginal plate, being three or more, appears to be a useful diagnostic character for Setihenricia, as has been suggested in previous studies, (2) the degree of spine tapering turned out to be less relevant in diagnosing the subgenus than previously supposed, (3) two newly introduced characters—(i) the width of adambulacral plates and (ii) the ratio of two measurements in ambulacral plates to the length of interradius—may be effective to distinguish members of this apparent Henricia subclade from other members of the genus.

To compile monitoring data across large numbers of species, scientists and policymakers mainly rely on diversity and species richness indices. This task may prove complicated however, as many indices exist and no individual metric undoubtedly emerges as the best overall. Here, using data from zooplankton surveys from 1998 to 2014, we examined year-to-year changes in copepod communities in two littoral ecosystems of Western Europe - the Arcachon Bay and the Gironde estuary - that share similar climate, but with different local ecological processes, especially hydrological conditions. We tested the ability of commonly used α and β-diversity metrics, such as species richness, Pielou's evenness or Jaccard's index, to mirror year-to-year changes in species abundances and we detected a synchronous change in both copepod abundances and α-diversity that took place circa 2005 in the two sites. In response to changes in environmental conditions such as nutrients, salinity, river discharge or particulate matter, two opposite biodiversity trends were observed, with a decrease in copepod diversity in the Arcachon Bay but an increase in the downstream part of the Gironde estuary. Although diversity metrics allowed us to well detect trends, the use of multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis provided important information on how and why diversity fluctuates. Our study provides evidence that long-term monitoring programmes must be encouraged for optimising management and conservation actions such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and that more local comparative studies need to be initiated for better characterising diversity trajectories at very fine scales at which ecologists often work.","Richirt, J.; Goberville, E.; Ruiz-Gonzalez, V.; Sautour, B.",WOS:000489190500003,"Ruiz-Gonzalez, Vania, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106304,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Copepod communities; Long-term changes; Diversity indices; Coastal systems; Multivariate analysis,Journal article,,,"Univ Antilles, Unite Biol Organismes & Ecosyst Aquat BOREA, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS,IRD,Sorbonne Univ,Univ Caen Normandie, CP53,61 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,Copepod communities; Long-term changes; Diversity indices; Coastal systems; Multivariate analysis,MARINE BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SOUTHERN BIGHT; GRAZING IMPACT; ARCACHON BAY; ZOOPLANKTON; CLIMATE; INDICATORS; PHYTOPLANKTON,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,,,,,,

The genus <i>Oncholaimus</i> is known to tolerate extreme geothermal conditions and high sulphide concentrations in shallow water hydrothermal vents, but it was only occasionally reported in deep-sea vents. In this study, we performed morphological, genetic and ecological investigations (including feeding strategies) on an abundant species of <i>Oncholaimus</i> recentlydiscovered at Lucky strike vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 1700 m water depth.Results: We described this species as <i>Oncholaimus dyvae</i> sp. nov.. This new species differs from all other members of the genus by the combination of the following characters: body length (up to 9mm), the presence of a long spicule (79 μm) with a distally pointed end, a complex pericloacal setal ornamentation with one precloacal papilla surrounded by short spines, and a body cuticule with very fine striation shortly posterior to the amphid opening. Overall, <i>O. dyvae</i> sp. nov. abundance increased with increasing temperature and vent emissions. Carbon isotopic ratios suggest that this species could consume both thiotroph and methanotrophic producers. Furthermore sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were detected in the cuticle, in the digestive cavity and in the intestine of <i>O. dyvae</i> sp. nov. suggesting a potential symbiotic association.Conclusions: This study improves our understanding of vent biology and ecology, revealing a new nematode species able to adapt and be very abundant in active vent areas due to their association with chemosynthetic micro-organisms. Faced by the rapid increase of anthropogenic pressure to access mineral resources in the deep sea, hydrothermal vents are particularly susceptible to be impacted by exploitation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits. It is necessary to document and understand vent species able to flourish in these peculiar ecosystems.","Zeppilli, D.; Bellec, L.; Cambon-Bonavita, M.-A.; Decraemer, W.; Fontaneto, D.; Fuchs, S.; Gayet, N.; Mandon, P.; Michel, L.N.; Portail, M.; Smol, N.; Sørensen, M.V.; Vanreusel, A.; Sarrazin, J.",WOS:000477659400001,"Fontaneto, Diego, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s40850-019-0044-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Deep sea, ""Hydrothermal vents""",,"Oncholaimus dyvae sp. nov.,; Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios",Journal article,,,"IFREMER Ctr Brest REM EEP LEP, CS10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",France,Oncholaimus dyvae sp. nov.; Hydrothermal vents; Deep sea; Carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios,FATTY-ACIDS; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; INDICATOR; MEIOFAUNA; SEDIMENTS; TUBEWORM; BEHAVIOR; EDIFICE,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

Among invertebrates, development is exceptionally slow, making observational studies of development logistically challenging, particularly when conducted under natural conditions in the field. Using multiple deployments to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, we characterized the development, in the field, of an unidentified buccinoidean gastropod species with encapsulated development. Thirteen egg capsules collected at Granite Harbor, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea, were attached to natural rock and outplanted at a depth of ~25 m at the base of the McMurdo Intake Jetty on 2 December 2007, photographed on 5 October 2011 and 6 September 2012 and then returned to the laboratory on 27 November 2015. In 2015, four capsules were open and empty, five were open and contained a single large hatchling and the remaining four capsules were intact but not open, each containing a single large juvenile snail. To identify the developing embryos, we sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) from two hatchlings and compared those sequences with those from adults collected near the egg mass, as well as with sequences of other buccinoideans from GenBank. Based on the close match between hatchling and adult COI sequences (hatchling sequences differed from those of an adult at only 2 of 658 nucleotide positions), we identified the embryos as Antarctodomus thielei (Powell, 1958)). The egg mass morphology and development of this species have not been previously described.

The presence of Ulva enhanced total meiofaunal abundance and nematode functional diversity when compared to a state free from macroalgal mats. The stranded Ulva supported high values of meiofaunal β-diversity as well. This unexpected response was likely due to the highly dynamic nature of open sandy beaches that prevents O2 depletion within sediments.

In this effort, an attempt has been made to evaluate a mangrove plantation site managed by a local non-governmental organization (NGO) after 2 years of implementation. In this framework, the plantation project was assessed by (i) biodiversity richness, (ii) composition and vegetation structure and (iii) interaction of biotic and abiotic factors and (iv) societal aspects. The floristic diversity includes ten true mangrove species and nine mangrove associates in the patch. The natural regeneration potential has remarkably increased after plantation, and Sonneratia apetala is considered as ‘champion species’ in terms of natural regeneration (seedling density 3730 ha<sup>−1</sup>). The colonization of the macro-benthos was significantly amplified after plantation, and three species of molluscs and fourteen crustacean species (brachyuran crabs, grapsid crabs, hermit crabs and scorpion mud lobster) with ample bioturbation dynamics were encountered during the study. The present short-term evaluation depicted that the implementing NGO is primarily successful in re-establishing the natural diversity and ecosystem functioning in an increasing anthropogenic interfered landscape, and local communities are managing the site. Thus, to achieve a successful mangrove plantation/restoration programme, formulation of a location-specific long-term monitoring plan and adoption of community-based co-management practices are recommended.","Dubey, S.K.; Censkowsky, U.; Roy, M.; Chand, B.K.; Dey, A.",,"Dubey, Sourabh Kumar, S.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-04417-6_22,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Mangrove plantation; Mangrove monitoring; Natural regeneration; Sundarban ,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective data management requires collaboration across activities including observations, metadata and data assembly, quality assurance and control (QA/QC), and data publication that enables local and interoperable discovery and access and secures archiving that guarantees long-term preservation. To achieve this, data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Here, we outline how these principles apply to ocean data and illustrate them with a few examples. In recent decades, ocean data managers, in close collaboration with international organizations, have played an active role in the improvement of environmental data standardization, accessibility, and interoperability through different projects, enhancing access to observation data at all stages of the data life cycle and fostering the development of integrated services targeted to research, regulatory, and operational users. As ocean observing systems evolve and an increasing number of autonomous platforms and sensors are deployed, the volume and variety of data increase dramatically. For instance, there are more than 70 data catalogs that contain metadata records for the polar oceans, a situation that makes comprehensive data discovery beyond the capacity of most researchers. To better serve research, operational, and commercial users, more efficient turnaround of quality data in known formats and made available through Web services is necessary. In particular, automation of data workflows will be critical to reduce friction throughout the data value chain. Adhering to the FAIR principles with free, timely, and unrestricted access to ocean observation data is beneficial for the originators, has obvious benefits for users, and is an essential foundation for the development of new services made possible with big data technologies.","Tanhua, T.; Pouliquen, S.; Hausman, J.; O'Brien, K.; Bricher, P.; de Bruin, T.F.; Buck, J.H.; Burger, E.F.; Carval, T.; Casey, K.S.; Diggs, S.; Giorgetti, A.; Glaves, H.; Harscoat, V.; Kinkade, D.; Muelbert, J.; Novellino, A.; Pfeil, B.; Pulsifer, P.L.; Van de Putte, A.; Robinson, E.; Schaap, D.; Smirnov, A.; Smith, N.; Snowden, D.; Spears, T.; Stall, S.; Tacoma, T.; Thijssen, P.; Tronstad, S.; Vandenberghe, T.; Wengren, M.; Wyborn, L.; Zhao, Z.",WOS:000479073100001,"Hausman, Jessica, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00440,,Lifewatch acknowledged,,,Data management,,FAIR; ocean; Data management; data services; ocean observing; standardization; interoperability,Journal article,,,"GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",Germany,FAIR; ocean; data management; data services; ocean observing; standardization; interoperability,OBSERVING SYSTEM; GLOBAL OCEAN,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel,x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

To test this, family‐level data were tabulated from the literature on the post‐Palaeozoic diversity of motile marine arthropod basibionts and sessile marine bryozoan epibionts. We found strong temporal correlation from general to more specific basibiont‐epibiont relationships (i.e. arthropods and bryozoans in general to decapods and encrusting gymnolaemates to robust decapods and encrusting cheilostomes in particular). We compared the diversification of bryozoans to another common group of basibionts (i.e. molluscs) and found weaker correlations. This suggests that the diversification of motile arthropods with hard carapaces (e.g. brachyuran crabs) may have played a role in the diversification of sessile bryozoans (e.g. encrusting cheilostomes) in the post‐Palaeozoic.","Key, M.M.; Schweitzer, C.E.",WOS:000481037600001,"Schweitzer, Carrie, C.E.","Kent State Univ Stark, Dept Geol, N Canton, OH 44720 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/let.12350,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Dickinson Coll, Dept Earth Sci, POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",USA,Arthropoda; Bryozoa; Cheilostomata; Chelicerata; coevolution; epibiosis,ANOMURAN DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS; RECENTLY PUBLISHED TAXA; ANNOTATED CHECKLIST; FAMILIES CHIROSTYLIDAE; PORTUNOIDEA RAFINESQUE; CRABS CRUSTACEA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS; CHEILOSTOME BRYOZOANS; LEVEL CLASSIFICATION; SPECIES SYNONYMIES,Paleontology,Paleontology,,,,,,

Here, we summarize the contribution of this recent methodology to the investigation of both terrestrial and aquatic taxa diet, and compare the level of novelty uncovered through the use of this technique regarding species' ecology. From a total of 150 studies analyzed, focusing on more than 250 vertebrate wild species, seven domesticated taxa, and humans, we suggest that barcoding has led to more significant findings for aquatic taxa and ecosystems, where direct observations of feeding events and consequent trophic niche understanding are typically limited. Finally, we introduce the term dietary DNA (dDNA) to describe environmental approaches that use DNA extracted from gut, stomach, or fecal contents, aiming to assess both species dietary habits and describe local biodiversity. Particularly, we highlight the complementarity of environmental DNA (eDNA) and dDNA as a new tool for biodiversity assessments in remote areas, including most of the aquatic realm.","Sousa, L.L.; Silva, S.M.; Xavier, R.",,"Xavier, Raquel, R.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/edn3.27,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"dietary DNA, dietary sampling, environmental DNA, food webs, high-throughput sequencing, trophic niche",Journal article,,,,,,,,,Cardiff University - School of Biological Science,,UK,,University,Science

Here, we provide the first systematic assessment of macrofaunal and megafaunal biodiversity at hydrothermal vents normalized against research effort. Cruise reports from scientific expeditions as well as other literature were used to characterize the extent of exploration, determine the relative biodiversity of different biogeographic provinces, identify knowledge gaps related to the distribution of research effort, and prioritize targets for additional sampling to establish biodiversity baselines ahead of potential commercial exploitation. The Northwest Pacific, Southwest Pacific, and Southern Ocean biogeographic provinces were identified as high biodiversity using rarefaction of family-level incidence data, whereas the North East Pacific Rise, Northern East Pacific, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Indian Ocean provinces had medium biodiversity, and the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center was identified as a province of relatively low biodiversity.

In this study, we applied a trait-based approach to assess the variation in the functional diversity of intertidal macrobenthic assemblages from Guaratuba Bay, a subtropical estuarine system in Southern Brazil. We expected that changes in sediment characteristics across and within estuarine zones would be followed by detectable changes in the trait diversity of infaunal assemblages. The estuarine gradient strongly affected overall functional diversity, especially on the largest spatial scale, which corresponded to 3 distinct salinity sectors. This was also the case for the variables grain size and depth of the redox discontinuity layer. We identified 3 assemblages with distinct functional trait composition among the sectors. Although the number of species remained relatively constant across sectors, the functional diversity increased from the inner, less saline to the outer, more saline sectors.

However, the chemical aspects of shell pigments have not been well understood. We studied the chemical basis of molluscan shell colors via resonance Raman microspectroscopy using a 514.5‐nm laser on six gastropod, 15 bivalve, and one cephalopod species. Polyene specific signals for C═C (ν<sup>1</sup>) or C─C (ν<sup>2</sup>) stretching bands were detected principally from the pigmented regions, and those peak positions correlated with the pigment colors. Because Raman shifts of those bands depend on the conjugation length of polyene backbones, which in turn, affect the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap, our observations suggest that the conjugation length of polyene is a determinant factor of shell color. Further, our observations and data from previous studies seemed to reveal a quantitative relationship between polyene backbone length and shell color. From an analysis of 89 polyene‐based pigments in 45 molluscan species, we found that yellow, orange/red, and purple/brown/black pigments originate from polyenes with conjugation lengths of 7–9, 9–10, and 10–12, respectively. The shell color shifts from yellow, orange, and red to purple as the polyene chain length increases as reported for free carotenoids. The biological mechanisms underlying the spatial regulations of polyene conjugation systems in molluscan shells will be the most important and intriguing issue to be addressed in the future.","Ishikawa, M.; Kagi, H.; Sasaki, T.; Endo, K.",WOS:000481107100001,"Ishikawa, Makiko, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/jrs.5708,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",Japan,biomolecules; polyenes; shell pigment; Mollusca; Raman spectroscopy,CONSTRICTA LAMARCK PROSOBRANCHIA; LINEAR POLYENES; PIGMENTS; CAROTENOIDS; SPECTRA; SCATTERING; BIOLOGY; MODEL; FOOD,Spectroscopy,Spectroscopy,University of Tokyo - Department of Earth and Planetary Science,x,Japan,,University,Science

This review focuses on the anticancer drug discovery potential of marine invertebrates from the North-West Pacific. The issues of biodiversity, chemodiversity, and the anticancer pharmacophore diversity this region hides are consecutively discussed. These three levels of diversity are analyzed from the point of view of the already discovered compounds, as well as from the assessment of the overall, still undiscovered and enormous potential. We further go into the predictions of the economic and societal benefits the full-scale exploration of this potential offers, and suggest strategic measures to be taken on the national level in order to unleash such full-scale exploration.

Recent efforts have clarified phylogenetic relationships in many different parts of the barnacle tree, but the outcomes of these phylogenetic studies have not yet been combined into a single hypothesis for all barnacles. In the present study, we applied a new “synthesis” tree approach to estimate the first working Barnacle Tree of Life. Using this approach, we integrated phylogenetic hypotheses from 27 studies, which did not necessarily include the same taxa or used the same characters, with hierarchical taxonomic information for all recognized species. This first synthesis tree contains 2,070 barnacle species and subspecies, including 239 barnacle species with phylogenetic information and 198 undescribed or unidentified species. The tree had 442 bifurcating nodes, indicating that 79.3% of all nodes are still unresolved. We found that the acorn and stalked barnacles, the Thoracica, and the parasitic Rhizocephala have the largest amount of published phylogenetic information. About half of the thecostracan families for which phylogenetic information was available were polyphyletic. We queried publicly available geographic occurrence databases for the group, gaining a sense of geographic gaps and hotspots in our phylogenetic knowledge.

The efficiency of selective device is mainly estimated by comparing species composition, the biomass and length spectrum of caught individuals and escapees while the functional traits of species are rarely accounted for. Using an innovative technical device to reduce catches of undersized individuals in a multispecific bottom trawl fishery in the Bay of Biscay, namely a T90 mesh cylinder, we measured functional traits on both caught and escaped individuals of 18 species. Using a Principal Component Analysis and K-means partitioning, we clustered species into 6 groups illustrating 6 different locomotion strategies. We identified functional traits related to body size, visual ability and locomotion, differing between caught individuals and escapees using Linear Mixed-effects Models. As expected, escapees were smaller on average but also tended to be more streamlined, with a high position of the eyes and fin features characteristic of manoeuvrability and propulsion. Here, we present how a trait-based approach can shed light on the biological characteristics influencing the efficiency of selective devices.","Mouchet, M.; Poirson, M.; Morandeau, F.; Vogel, C.; Méhault, S.; Kopp, D.",WOS:000482886700043,"Mouchet, Maud, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-47117-4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat, CNRS, SU, UMR 7204,MNHN, CP135,43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,,SIZE-SELECTIVITY; IMPROVE SELECTIVITY; TRAWL FISHERY; MAXIMUM GIRTH; TOTAL LENGTH; MESH CODEND; HABITAT USE; BEHAVIOR; FLATFISH; LOCOMOTION,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

Thus, calcifying organisms that record growth history can provide insight into both the ancient environments in which they lived and their own physiology and life history. However, interpreting them requires understanding which environmental factors have the greatest influence on growth rate and the extent to which evolutionary history constrains growth rates across lineages. We integrated satellite measurements of sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration with a database of growth coefficients, body sizes, and life spans for 692 populations of living marine bivalves in 195 species, set within the context of a new maximum-likelihood phylogeny of bivalves. We find that environmental predictors overall explain only a small proportion of variation in growth coefficient across all species; temperature is a better predictor of growth coefficient than food supply, and growth coefficient is somewhat more variable at higher summer temperatures. Growth coefficients exhibit moderate phylogenetic signal, and taxonomic membership is a stronger predictor of growth coefficient than any environmental predictor, but phylogenetic inertia cannot fully explain the disjunction between our findings and the extensive body of work demonstrating strong environmental control on growth rates within taxa. Accounting for evolutionary history is critical when considering shells as historical archives. The weak relationship between variation in food supply and variation in growth coefficient in our data set is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the increase in mean body size through the Phanerozoic was driven by increasing productivity enabling faster growth rates.","Saulsbury, J.; Moss, D.K.; Ivany, L.C.; Kowalewski, M.; Lindberg, D.R.; Gillooly, J.F.; Heim, N.A.; McClain, C.R.; Payne, J.L.; Roopnarine, P.D.; Schöne, B.R.; Goodwin, D.; Finnegan, S.",WOS:000482047300002,"Saulsbury, James, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/pab.2019.20,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",USA,,DEEP-SEA; METABOLISM; RESPONSES; BIOMASS; SIZE; TIME; LIFE; ENERGETICS; DIVERSITY; MOLLUSKS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,,,,,,

Departures from Linnaean nomenclature are sometimes intentional, but there are also other, less obvious but widespread forms of not Code-compliant grey nomenclature. A first problem is due to the circumstance that the Codes are intended to rule over the way names are applied to species and other taxonomic units, whereas users of taxonomy need names to be applied to specimens. For different reasons, it is often impossible to refer a specimen with certainty to a named species, and in those cases an open nomenclature is employed. Second, molecular taxonomy leads to the discovery of clusters of gene sequence diversity not necessarily equivalent to the species recognized and named by taxonomists. Those clusters are mostly indicated with informal names or formulas that challenge comparison between different publications or databases. In several instances, it is not even clear if a formula refers to an individual voucher specimen, or is a provisional species name. The use of non-Linnaean names and formulas must be revised and strengthened by fixing standard formats for the different kinds of objects or hypotheses and providing permanent association of ‘grey names’ with standardized source information such as author and year. In the context of a broad-scope revisitation of aims and scope of scientific nomenclature, it may be worth rethinking if natural objects like plant galls and lichens, although other than the ‘single-entity’ objects traditionally covered by biological classifications, may nevertheless deserve taxonomic names.","Minelli, A.",WOS:000482227200001,"Minelli, Alessandro, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s40656-019-0271-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Open nomenclature; Grey nomenclature; Data aggregation; Taxonomic concept; Rules for non-Linnaean nomenclature;  Lichen names; Plant gall names   ,Journal article,,,"Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via Ugo Bassi 58 B, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",Italy,Open nomenclature; Grey nomenclature; Data aggregation; Taxonomic concept; Rules for non-Linnaean nomenclature; Lichen names; Plant gall names,TABACI GENNADIUS HEMIPTERA; INCLUSIVE TAXONOMIC UNIT; CIONA-INTESTINALIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; IDENTIFICATIONS; GLOSSIPHONIIDAE; PHYLOGENY; BARCODE; CASSAVA; SYSTEM,History & Philosophy Of Science,History & Philosophy of Science,,,,,,

Sediment fine fraction, organic matter content, and trace element concentrations were found to increase with depth, independently from the mussel farm. Moreover, the structure and composition of the macrobenthic communities were likewise structured by depth. Turnover was the dominant temporal and spatial pattern of beta diversity for all communities. Furthermore, the functional diversity of these communities was unaffected by the mussel farm.

Ischnomesids were sampled during two expeditions (SokhoBio & KuramBio II) in depths between 3299 – 9584 m. Subsequent to morphological identifications, mitochondrial COI was successfully sequenced for 208 of the 298 sampled specimens. Based on two computational approaches (ABGD and GMYC) 24–45 putative species (lineages) could be delimited. The initially 21 defined morphospecies matched poorly with these COI lineages, in particularly females and juveniles were differently assigned. Fortimesus Kavanagh and Wilson, 2007 was found to be the most abundant and diverse genus, in particular in the hadal. The hadal of the KKT had a higher species diversity (6–9 species) than the adjacent Sea of Okhotsk (1 species), but lower diversity than the abyssal northwest Pacific Basin (15–24 species). Most species were restricted to a single studied area, wider distributions of ∼300 km were mainly observed for hadal species within the KKT and only to a lesser degree for abyssal species. Species distributions across the KKT were rare and again predominately observed for hadal species. The abyssal species were either restricted to one side of the KKT or the genetic distances between populations on the opposite sides of the KKT were very high. This implies that the KKT serves as an isolation barrier for poorly dispersing benthic species like the herein studied Ischnomesidae.","Bober, J.; Brandt, A.; Frutos, I.; Schwentner, M.",WOS:000496861900012,"Bober, Johanna, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102174,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Ischnomesidae,Deep sea,,COI; abyssal; hadal; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench; Sea of Okhotsk; NW Pacific,Journal article,,,"Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Martin Luther King Pl, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",Germany,Ischnomesidae; COI; Deep sea; Abyssal; Hadal; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench; Sea of Okhotsk; NW Pacific,MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; OXIDASE SUBUNIT-I; SPECIES DELIMITATION; EPIBENTHIC SLEDGE; NORTHWEST PACIFIC; ABYSSAL-PLAIN; 1ST INSIGHTS; DEEP; SEA; BIODIVERSITY,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Hamburg - Center for Natural History - Zoological Museum Hamburg,x,New Zealand,,Museum,Science

However, the mechanisms that enable these interactions, and how actiniarian diversity and abundance mediates associate assemblages, remains poorly understood. Here, we compared sea anemone species richness and abundance with that of their associated decapod crustaceans and teleost fishes across adjacent coral reef and seagrass habitats at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize. At least 16 decapod and seven fish species were associated with anemones across both habitats, including several previously undocumented associations. While overall anemone-associate richness did not differ between habitats, seagrass anemones had the greatest mean abundance and diversity of both decapod and fish associates. This suggests that the importance of anemones as microhabitat reflected broader benthic complexity and shelter availability, with species aggregating on sea anemones when access to alternative shelter, such as corals, was limited. Patterns of associate distributions on anemones were also highly structured, in terms of both associate and anemone species, with these patterns likely reflecting a combination of associate specialization, intraspecific competition, and anemone morphology and toxicity. The diverse multi-species associate complexes observed suggest that sea anemones provide an important refuge for both specialized and generalist species and so have the potential to increase faunal diversity and abundance within tropical coastal habitats.","Brooker, R.M.; Feeney, W.E.; Sih, T.L.; Ferrari, M.C.O.; Chivers, D.P.",WOS:000501242900011,"Feeney, William, W.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-019-00993-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Caribbean,Actiniaria,,,Sea anemone; Habitat complexity; Predation risk ,Journal article,,,"Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",Canada,Actiniaria; Sea anemone; Caribbean; Habitat complexity; Predation risk,CARIBBEAN SEA-ANEMONES; BARTHOLOMEA-ANNULATA; HOST-SELECTION; CLEANING INTERACTIONS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SNAPPING SHRIMPS; HABITAT; GROWTH; COEXISTENCE; ACTINIARIA,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Historically, scientists have pointed out the importance of accurate trade statistics to monitor this trade. Today, there remains no global systems in place to monitor it. Europe is a major importer of coral reef fishes, and uses the Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) to monitor trade in live animals for disease prevention. This database is not intended to record strict species-specific information on marine ornamental fishes, rather numbers of traded specimens and information on species to at least family level. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the volume of trade into Europe, which amounted to approximately 4 million marine ornamental fishes per year during 2014 and 2017. Susceptible species were identified using the number of traded specimens, trends in the trade volume, IUCN Red List conservation status, as well as vulnerability according to FishBase. After normalization of this data a score was created to produce a watchlist that establishes susceptibility to overexploitation of the species traded considering all parameters combined. Unfortunately, almost one third of all species is listed as data deficient or not evaluated by the IUCN Red List and could not be included in this calculation. Species on the watchlist should be given priority for further monitoring through the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). This study suggests that TRACES, subject to several modifications, could be used as a tool to monitor trade in marine ornamental fishes.","Biondo, M.V.; Burki, R.P.",WOS:000495518700031,"Biondo, Monica, M.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103620,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Coral reef fishes; European and international trade; Trade monitoring; Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species CITES; IUCN; Watchlist,Journal article,,,"Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Baltzerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",Switzerland,Coral reef fishes; European and international trade; Trade monitoring; Convention on International Trade of; Endangered Species CITES; IUCN; Watchlist,CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; AQUARIUM TRADE; OPPORTUNITIES; CONSERVATION; IMPORTS; WELFARE,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,,,,,,

If native and introduced taxa remain reproductively semi‐isolated, human‐mediated secondary contact may promote genetic exchange across newly created hybrid zones, potentially impacting native genetic diversity and invasive species spread. Here, we investigate the contributions of recent divergence histories and ongoing (post‐introduction) gene flow between the invasive marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis and a morphologically indistinguishable and taxonomically contentious native Australian taxon, <i>Mytilus planulatus</i>. Using transcriptome‐wide markers, we demonstrate that two contemporary <i>M. galloprovincialis</i> introductions into southeastern Australia originate from genetically divergent lineages from its native range in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Europe, where both introductions have led to repeated instances of admixture between introduced and endemic populations. Through increased genome‐wide resolution of species relationships, combined with demographic modelling, we validate that mussels sampled in Tasmania are representative of the endemic Australian taxon (<i>M. planulatus</i>), but share strong genetic affinities to <i>M. galloprovincialis</i>. Demographic inferences indicate late‐Pleistocene divergence times and historical gene flow between the Tasmanian endemic lineage and northern <i>M. galloprovincialis</i>, suggesting that native and introduced taxa have experienced a period of historical isolation of at least 100,000 years. Our results demonstrate that many genomic loci and sufficient sampling of closely related lineages in both sympatric (e.g., Australian populations) and allopatric (e.g., northern‐hemisphere <i>Mytilus</i> taxa) ranges are necessary to accurately (i) interpret patterns of intraspecific differentiation and to (ii) distinguish contemporary invasive introgression from signatures left by recent divergence histories in high dispersal marine species.

This paper reports upon new data from IUP occupations at Wadi Aghar, a rock shelter site in the southern Levant. In combining the results of radiometric dates and lithic analyses, we clarify the chronological and cultural position of Wadi Aghar assemblages in the Levantine IUP. As for the records about mobility, on-site activities, and resource procurement behaviors, we present analyses of lithic use-wear, tool-type composition, soil micromorphology, and marine shells. The lithic analyses and the optically stimulated luminescence (and subsidiary radiocarbon) dating of the Wadi Aghar materials suggest their chronocultural position in the IUP (45–40 ka for Layers C–D1; 39–36 ka for Layer B; possibly 50 ka for Layer D2), providing the southernmost location for the IUP in Eurasia. In the Levant, Wadi Aghar represents one of the few IUP sites in the inland areas. The results also indicate that the timing and technological sequences from the IUP to the following bladelet industries differed between the inland and coastal zones, likely reflecting geographically variable adaptive behaviors and/or cultural transmissions. One of the behavioral characteristics of IUP foragers at Wadi Aghar is the procurement of remote resources, represented by the transportation of marine shells from the Red Sea: Canarium fusiforme and Canarium cf. mutabile. Whether it was a direct procurement with increased mobility or a result of intergroup exchanges, it was not part of behavioral repertoires during the late MP in the same area. This can be understood as the expansion of resource procurement range, functioning as additional buffers from risk in the semiarid environments in the inland Levant.","Kadowaki, S.; Tamura, T.; Sano, K.; Kurozumi, T.; Maher, L.A.; Wakano, J.Y.; Omori, T.; Kida, R.; Hirose, M.; Massadeh, S.; Henry, D.O.",WOS:000490048000005,"Kadowaki, Seiji, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.102646,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Initial Upper Paleolithic; Levant; Lithic technology; OSL dating; Lithic use-wear; Marine shell,Journal article,,,"Nagoya Univ, Nagoya Univ Museum, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",Japan,Initial Upper Paleolithic; Levant; Lithic technology; OSL dating; Lithic use-wear; Marine shell,ISSUE PERSONAL ORNAMENTS; HOMINID BURIAL SITE; U-SERIES; BLADELET PRODUCTION; NEANDERTHAL SITE; UCAGIZLI CAVE; KEBARA CAVE; AMUD-CAVE; ESR DATES; MIDDLE,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology,Anthropology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,

Increased ocean temperatures are speculated to be a driving factor in controlling jellyfish populations worldwide; warmer temperatures increase asexual budding of benthic polyps, and many species strobilate in the spring as water temperatures begin to warm following cold winters. As ocean temperatures rise, it is important to determine thermal triggers in reproduction in jellyfish populations. This study investigated the effects of temperature on 1) asexual (budding) reproductive rates, 2) timing of strobilation, and 3) strobilation success (number of polyps strobilating and number of ephyrae per polyp), for Aurelia aurita, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, and Chrysaora fuscescens polyps exposed to constant temperatures of 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C. Asexual reproduction rates were similar for all species and increased with increasing temperature. Strobilation occurred at 10 °C for all species and all three species began strobilation at the same time (21–23 days). Aurelia aurita and C. fuscescens also strobilated at 15 °C, but strobilated later, had less polyps strobilating, and produced less ephyrae per polyp than the same species at 10 °C. If temperature contributes to instigation of strobilation, ocean temperatures and the timing of warming will be a primary control of the size and distribution of adult populations. Slight warming may benefit temperate species such as A. aurita that can strobilate successfully at increased temperatures, but other species may be restricted by warming waters. Further, if warming is such that proper overwintering temperatures do not occur, polyps may not be exposed to conditions enabling strobilation. While it has been speculated that jellyfish will be favored under warmer ocean conditions, future climate change may prohibit species that require specific conditions to strobilate.","Treible, L.M.; Condon, R.H.",WOS:000490045300004,"Treible, Laura, L.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151204,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Jellyfish; Scyphozoan; Polyp; Ephyra; Asexual reproduction; Climate change,Journal article,,,"Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",USA,Jellyfish; Scyphozoan; Polyp; Ephyra; Asexual reproduction; Climate change,NETTLE CHRYSAORA-QUINQUECIRRHA; CTENOPHORE MNEMIOPSIS-LEIDYI; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; AURELIA-AURITA; NARRAGANSETT BAY; COMMON JELLYFISH; RIVER ESTUARY; CNIDARIA; SALINITY; BLOOMS,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

In addition, the relationship of degree of variation in macrobenthic abundance across unit area, 'patchiness', to this macroecological picture was investigated. Across the group of 30 dominant faunal components as a whole, the most widely and abundantly distributed species had (a) the highest mean abundances and (b) the least spatially-patchy densities in each of Knysna's diverse regions and at all spatial scales from landscape to local; however no significant relationship was observed between mean abundance and degree of patchiness. Individual dominant species displayed considerable variation; some showing positive occupancy/patchiness correlations, and several displaying significant positive and others negative abundance/patchiness ones. As expected along the estuarine gradient, positive and negative correlations of both abundance and occupancy with distance upstream were found in different species (both metrics in a given species always responding in the same manner), although significant upstream relationships with patchiness were found in only two. Local patchiness clearly contributes macroecological information additional to that provided by abundance or occupancy.","Barnes, R.S.K.",WOS:000496611500002,"Barnes, R.S.K.","Knysna Basin Project, ZA-6570 Knysna, Western Cape, South Africa.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106360,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Density, ""Macrobenthos"", ""Occurrence"", ""Patchiness"", ""Seagrass""",,Estuary; Knysna,Journal article,,,"Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Makhanda, Eastern Cape, South Africa.",South Africa,Density; Estuary; Knysna; Macrobenthos; Occurrence; Patchiness; Seagrass,ABUNDANCE-OCCUPANCY RELATIONSHIPS; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; INTERTIDAL SEAGRASS; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; COMMUNITY; MACROINVERTEBRATES; HOMOGENEITY; PATCHINESS,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Knysna Basin Project,,,,,

There are unknowns in the wild harvest so that the sustainability of marine ornamental fish trade can therefore be questioned with aquaculture being perceived as a responsible alternative for the procurement of these ornamental marine fish. However, there are still many technical constraints that hinder its development. These blocks require additional coordination with the outcome being an accelerated development of ornamental marine fish production. The main objective of this review was to better identify, understand and discuss the role and the impacts of academic research in the production of marine ornamental fish through qualitative and quantitative approaches. To do so, 222 selected scientific publications (including peer‐reviewed articles, conferences articles, thesis and reports) from the literature available to date were analysed and outcomes were framed in perspective of the total number of captive‐bred species. Results of the meta‐analyses indicate that academic research has led to significant advances in the breeding of some of the more difficult to breed species. While it has a leading role in conservation, its advance of techniques still lags behind private companies and hobbyists. Partnerships promoting synergistic activities between academic research institutes and the private sector (aquaculture farms and public aquariums) are important to optimize future ornamental marine fish production.","Pouil, S.; Tlusty, M.F.; Rhyne, A.L.; Metian, M.",WOS:000531069200035,"Pouil, Simon, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/raq.12381,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Aquaculture,,academic research; captive breeding; fishkeeping; research and development; sustainable production,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, Inst Rech Dev IRD, ISEM, Pl Eugene Bataillon, Montpellier 05, France.",France,academic research; aquaculture; captive breeding; fishkeeping; research and development; sustainable production,ANGELFISH POMACANTHUS-SEMICIRCULATUS; PUBLIC AQUARIUMS; GROWTH; TRADE; CONSERVATION; PERSPECTIVES; CULTURE; IMPORTS; LARVAL; ISSUES,Fisheries,Fisheries,,,,,,

The places where science is performed and the places where science is published are still regarded as different realms. Publishing is still a post-experimental, tedious, manual process, too often limited to articles, in some contexts semantically linked to datasets, rarely to software, generally disregarding digital representations of experiments.    In this work we present the OpenAIRE Research Community Dashboard (RCD), designed to overcome some of these barriers for a given research community, minimizing the technical efforts and without renouncing any of the community services or practices. The RCD flanks digital laboratories of research communities with scholarly communication tools for discovering and publishing interlinked scientific products such as literature, datasets, and software.

Turtles exhibited a combination of coastal and oceanic migrations pathways that ranged from 957 km to 1,131 km. Of the six turtles, five completed their migration and maintained residency at the same foraging ground near the coastal waters of Accra, Ghana until transmission was lost.

To achieve this, the study relied on both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected from direct observation, informal group discussions and semi-structured interviews involving state officials, coastal community groups and other civil society organisations in the west maritime district of Southwest Cameroon. The article reveals a plethora of fisheries-related crimes encompassing corruption (i.e. bribery and abuse of office), document and identity fraud, illegal exploitation of fish maws and endangered marine mammals. Other crimes associated to the fisheries sector included: smuggling of contraband goods, arms smuggling, illegal migration, illegal recruitment and abuse of workers' rights. Through these examples, this research empirically demonstrates the interrelationship of the different criminal practices and their organised and transnational dimension. The study also paints a complex picture of criminality perpetuated by a sophisticated network of both local and foreign industrial fisheries stakeholders. Consequently, addressing illicit activities in the maritime fisheries sector requires cooperation from a wide range of both state and non-state actors in investigating and analysing the nature of fisheries crime practices, the agents involved and their modes of operation. This approach is necessary to gain a better understanding of the problem and enable actors design appropriate and targeted management responses.","Beseng, M.",WOS:000495518700040,"Beseng, Maurice, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103669,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Illegal fishing; Fisheries crime; Transnational organized crime; Security; Cameroon,Journal article,,,"Coventry Univ, Ctr Trust Peace & Social Relat, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",England,illegal fishing; Fisheries crime; Transnational organized crime; Security; Cameroon,ILLEGAL; AFRICA,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,,,,,,

Technological advancements and fishery subsidies have granted ever-increasing access to populations of sharks, tunas, billfishes, and other predators. Wilderness refuges, defined here as areas beyond the detectable range of human influence, are therefore increasingly rare. In order to achieve marine resources sustainability, large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) with pelagic components are being implemented. However, such conservation efforts require knowledge of the critical habitats for predators, both across shallow reefs and the deeper ocean. Here, we fill this gap in knowledge across the Indo-Pacific by using 1,041 midwater baited videos to survey sharks and other pelagic predators such as rainbow runner (<em>Elagatis bipinnulata</em>), mahi-mahi (<em>Coryphaena hippurus)</em>, and black marlin (<em>Istiompax indica)</em>. We modeled three key predator community attributes: vertebrate species richness, mean maximum body size, and shark abundance as a function of geomorphology, environmental conditions, and human pressures. All attributes were primarily driven by geomorphology (35%−62% variance explained) and environmental conditions (14%−49%). While human pressures had no influence on species richness, both body size and shark abundance responded strongly to distance to human markets (12%−20%). Refuges were identified at more than 1,250 km from human markets for body size and for shark abundance. These refuges were identified as remote and shallow seabed features, such as seamounts, submerged banks, and reefs. Worryingly, hotpots of large individuals and of shark abundance are presently under-represented within no-take MPAs that aim to effectively protect marine predators, such as the British Indian Ocean Territory. Population recovery of predators is unlikely to occur without strategic placement and effective enforcement of large no-take MPAs in both coastal and remote locations.","Letessier, T.B.; Mouillot, D.; Bouchet, P.J.; Vigliola, L.; Fernandes, M.C.; Thompson, C.; Boussarie, G.; Turner, J.; Juhel, J.-B.; Maire, E.; Caley, M.J.; Koldewey, H.J.; Friedlander, A.; Sala, E.; Meeuwig, J.J.",WOS:000483408500011,"Letessier, Tom, T.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000366,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, M092, Crawley, Australia.",Australia,,PROTECTED AREAS; SHARK SANCTUARY; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; TRACKING; OCEAN; CONSEQUENCES; MORTALITY; HOTSPOTS; COASTAL,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,,,,

This is crucial to provide scientists and stakeholders with the support and knowledge necessary to quantify environmental change and its impact on the sustainable use of the seas and coasts. In this paper, we explore the potential for the coastal and marine components of the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network (ILTER) to fill this need for integrated global observation, and highlight how ecological observations are necessary to address the challenges posed by climate change and evolving human needs and stressors within the coastal zone. The ILTER is a global network encompassing 44 countries and 700 research sites in a variety of ecosystems across the planet, more than 100 of which are located in coastal and marine environments (ILTER-CMS). While most of the ILTER-CMS were established after the year 2000, in some cases they date back to the early 1900s. At ILTER sites, a broad variety of abiotic and biotic variables are measured, which may feed into other global initiatives. The ILTER community has produced tools to harmonize and compare measurements and methods, allowing for data integration workflows and analyses between and within individual ILTER sites. After a brief historical overview of ILTER, with emphasis on the marine component, we analyze the potential contribution of the ILTER-CMS to global coastal and ocean observation, adopting the “Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT)” approach. We also identify ways in which the <i>in situ</i> parameters collected at ILTER sites currently fit within the Essential Ocean Variables framework (as proposed by the Framework for Ocean Observation recommendations) and provide insights on the use of new technology in long-term studies. Final recommendations point at the need to further develop observational activities at LTER sites and improve coordination among them and with external related initiatives in order to maximize their exploitation and address present and future challenges in ocean observations.","Muelbert, J.H.; Nidzieko, N.J.; Acosta, A.T.R.; Beaulieu, S.E.; Bernardino, A.F.; Boikova, E.; Bornman, T.G.; Cataletto, B.; Deneudt, K.; Eliason, E.; Kraberg, A.; Nakaoka, M.; Pugnetti, A.; Ragueneau, O.; Scharfe, M.; Soltwedel, T.; Sosik, H.M.; Stanisci, A.; Stefanova, K.; Stéphan, P.; Stier, A.; Wikner, J.; Zingone, A.",WOS:000482977400001,"Zingone, Adriana, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00527,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,climate change; marine ecosystems; ecology; EOVs; SWOT; DEIMS,Journal article,,,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine Sci & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",Australia,climate change; marine ecosystems; ecology; EOVs; SWOT; DEIMS,IN-SITU; ECOSYSTEM; SENSOR,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Tasmania - Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS),x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

However, variability in VRE outputs poses challenges in power system operation in terms of increased demand for backup and reserve capacity. These challenges can be effectively mitigated by “geographical smoothing”, because spreading VRE deployment over a large area largely reduces the variability associated with the collective output of VRE. Based on meteorological reanalysis data, this study characterised the return and volatility (i.e. mean and standard deviation of hourly capacity factor) per VRE asset in China at a high-resolution grid cell level. This enabled to identify the efficient frontier of optimal VRE portfolios that capture the geographical smoothing effect for China’s future power system, using modern portfolio theory. The portfolio volatility is minimized for each attainable return. We analysed key statistics of optimal portfolios, including technology shares, levelized cost of electricity and capacity factor at-risk values. Our results show complementarity between wind and solar in China, reflected in more optimal return-volatility performance of wind & solar portfolios, as compared to wind-only and solar-only portfolios. In addition, our results show that portfolios with unconstrained technology shares perform much better in return-volatility performance than portfolios with constrained technology shares. This suggests existing scenarios in literature with pre-defined shares of different VRE technologies might be sub-optimal. This study also shows that for optimal wind & solar portfolios a “firm” non-zero minimum portfolio capacity factor (1.4–5.5%) can exist with 100% availability.","Hu, J.; Harmsen, R.; Crijns-Graus, W.; Worrell, E.",WOS:000497971400111,"Hu, Jing, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113614,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Variable renewable electricity; Efficient frontier; Portfolio; Geographical smoothing; Capacity factor; Geographical potentials,Journal article,,,"Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Variable renewable electricity; Efficient frontier; Portfolio; Geographical smoothing; Capacity factor; Geographical potentials,WIND POWER; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; REANALYSIS; RESOURCES; SCALE,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,,,,,,

In order to study cost-optimal and reliable zero and negative carbon power systems, a power system model of Western Europe for 2050 is developed. Realistic future technology costs, demand levels and generator flexibility constraints are considered. The optimised portfolios are tested for both favourable and unfavourable future weather conditions using results from a global climate model, accounting for the potential impacts of climate change on Europe’s weather. The cost optimal mix for zero or negative carbon power systems consists of firm low-carbon capacity, intermittent renewable energy sources and flexibility capacity. In most scenarios, the amount of low-carbon firm capacity is around 75% of peak load, providing roughly 65% of the electricity demand. Furthermore, it is found that with a high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, a high dependence on cross border transmission, batteries and a shift to new types of ancillary services is required to maintain a reliable power system. Despite relatively small changes in the total generation from intermittent renewable energy sources between favourable and unfavourable weather years of 6%, emissions differ up to 70 MtCO2 yr−1 and variable systems costs up to 25%. In a highly interconnected power system with significant flexible capacity in the portfolio and minimal curtailment of intermittent renewables, the potential role of green hydrogen as a means of electricity storage appears to be limited.","van Zuijlen, B.; Zappa, W.; Turkenburg, W.; van der Schrier, G.; van den Broek, M.",WOS:000497971400094,"van Zuijlen, Bas, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113587,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Power system modelling; Carbon neutral power systems; CCS; Intermittent renewable energy sources; Negative emissions,Journal article,,,"Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Power system modelling; Carbon neutral power systems; CCS; Intermittent renewable energy sources; Negative emissions,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; ENERGY SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; WIND; UK; FLEXIBILITY; GERMANY; STORAGE; SHARES; PLANTS,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,,,,,,

In addition to these systems, the understanding of maritime activities and their impact on the environment also requires contextual maritime data capturing additional features to ships' kinematic from complementary data sources (environmental, contextual, geographical, …). The dataset described in this paper contains ship information collected through the AIS, prepared together with spatially and temporally correlated data characterising the vessels, the area where they navigate and the situation at sea.

The NW Pacific includes several shallow-water oceanic islands and deep-sea basins differing in depths, hydrology and isolation. The adjacent Arctic Ocean includes the northern Bering and southern Chukchi Sea, areas of high productivity characterized by short food chains and shallow depths. Despite the NW Pacifićs high species richness, characterization of species diversity and species composition in this region remains poorly explored and/or unknown. Here we attempt to discover how geographic boundaries and depth shape current community assemblages in this area by limiting species richness and geographic distribution ranges. All geographic distribution records were extracted from Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Distribution data were then cleaned, resulting in a final dataset including 324,916 distribution records of 17,414 species ranging from 0 to 10,900 m depth. We calculated the rate of endemicity and alpha species richness per ecoregion. We also showed how species composition and community structure varies between the tropical and temperate NW Pacific and adjacent Arctic Ocean when sampling bias is accounted for using rarefaction. After accounting for sampling bias, the Eastern Philippines had the greatest species richness (for both pelagic and benthic species) in the NW Pacific and its adjacent Arctic Ocean, and the lowest species richness was observed in Papua. Despite the high species richness in the Eastern Philippines, the Yellow Sea and Gulf of Tonkin had the highest benthic species endemicity rates (ca. 70%) and Aleutian Islands had the highest pelagic endemicity rate (ca. 45%) among all other ecoregions. In the NW Pacific, Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca contributed more than 50% to the species composition of the community. In the Arctic Ocean, Arthropoda, Annelida, and Mollusca were the dominant taxa comprising ca. 82% of the species community. Two significantly distinguished clusters (North and South clusters) were identified based on species similarity analysis including ecoregions of the (1) polar Arctic Ocean and temperate North NW Pacific, and (2) tropical and sub-tropical NW Pacific. We also calculated marine species richness hotspots (actual and expected ES50) and centers of endemism in the NW Pacific and adjacent Arctic Ocean. These analyses reveal an opportunity for marine conservation planning effort as reporting species richness and endemicity hotspots could be highly effective in pinpointing and preventing biodiversity loss.","Saeedi, H.; Simões, M.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000496861900024,"Simões, Marianna, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102199,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Deep Sea Node, Frankfurt, Germany.",Germany,,LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENTS; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; PATTERNS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; CONSERVATION; SEAMOUNTS; CENTERS,Oceanography,Oceanography,,,,,,

Access to marine genetic resources (MGR) for the biodiversity research community is essential to allow these environments to be better characterised. Negotiations have commenced under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to develop a new treaty to further the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in ABNJ. It is timely to consider the relevant issues with the development of the treaty underway. Currently uncertainties surround the legal definition of MGR and scope of related benefit-sharing, against a background of regional and global governance gaps in ABNJ. These complications are mirrored in science, with recent major advances in the field of genomics, but variability in handling of the resulting increasing volumes of data. Here, we attempt to define the concept of MGR from a scientific perspective, review current practices for the generation of and access to MGR from ABNJ in the context of relevant regulations, and illustrate the utility of best-practice with a case study. We contribute recommendations with a view to strengthen best-practice in accessibility of MGR, including: funder recognition of the central importance of taxonomy/biodiversity research; support of museums/collections for long-term sample curation; open access to data; usage and further development of globally recognised data standards and platforms; publishing of datasets via open-access, quality controlled and standardised data systems and open access journals; commitment to best-practice workflows; a global registry of cruises; and lastly development of a clearing house to further centralised access to the above. We argue that commitment to best-practice would allow greater sharing of MGR for research and extensive secondary use including conservation and environmental monitoring, and provide an exemplar for access and benefit-sharing (ABS) to inform the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) process.","Rabone, M.; Harden-Davies, H.; Collins, J.E.; Zajderman, S.; Appeltans, W.; Droege, G.; Brandt, A.; Pardo-Lopez, L.; Dahlgren, T.G.; Glover, A.G.; Horton, T.",WOS:000485256000002,"Harden-Davies, Harriet, H.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2019.00520,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,marine genetic resources (MGR); data standards; open access; taxonomy;biodiversity; access and benefit-sharing (ABS); conservation; areasbeyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ),Journal article,,,"Free Univ Berlin, Bot Garden & Bot Museum Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",Germany,marine genetic resources (MGR); data standards; open access; taxonomy; biodiversity; access and benefit-sharing (ABS); conservation; areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ),DEEP; AREAS; CONSERVATION; COLLECTIONS; INFORMATION; SPECIMENS; SCIENCE; REGIME; WORLD,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Determining the impact of pile-driving activity on the spatio-temporal distribution of Harbour Porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) in the Belgian Part of the North Sea. MSc Thesis. Ghent University: Gent.  46 pp.","Over the past few years the increase in human population worldwide has changed the underwater soundscape. Loud, new, unfamiliar noises are being introduced to the environment, impacting many species of animals. This has particularly harmful effects on marine organisms that rely heavily on their sense of hearing, such as harbour porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>). Harbour porpoises use echolocation to navigate, to orient themselves in the water column, to communicate with one another, and to detect prey. The introduction of impulsive noises into their habitats can be detrimental to this sensitive species, as it may cause them to undergo adverse behavioural reactions, stress, physical injury and sometimes death. The aim of this study is to assess how impulsive pile-driving noise has an impact on the harbour porpoise distribution in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) through passive acoustic monitoring.","Piesinger, N.",,"Piesinger, Nikola, N.",Ghent University,,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,,MSc,,,,,,,Ghent University,,Belgium,x,University,Science

It comprises three different management areas: the central one (“core”, strict protection, only control and monitoring activities), surrounded by a “buffer” area (authorized activities, e.g. scientific research) and an external “transition” area (productive and extractive activities contemplated in the Management Plan). Beyond the transition area, only the southern shelf-break is protected, after the creation of the “Namuncurá II” MPA in December 2018.<strong> Objective:</strong> provide the inventory of polychaetes collected during 2016 and 2017 at the core (98 m depth), buffer (128 m depth), transition (133 m-189 m depth) areas of the Namuncurá I MPA, together with slope areas (220 m-798 m depth). <strong>Methods:</strong> taken with a trawl net used to characterize the faunal assemblages and to compare results with other Magellan areas. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were applied to a Bray-Curtis similarity index to assess polychaete assemblages in the NMPA - BB slope and Magellan region respectively; SIMPER (Similarity Percentage Analyses) and ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) were performed. <strong>Results:</strong> A total of 918 individuals, which correspond to 39 taxa distributed in 22 families, were recorded in samples from NMPA and BB slope, mainly epibenthic or associated with the large corals collected. <em>Ampharete kerguelensis </em>McIntosh, 1885; <em>Hyalinoecia artifex</em> Verrill, 1880; <em>Idanthyrsus macropaleus</em> (Schmarda, 1861); <em>Laetmonice producta </em>Grube, 1877; <em>Onuphis pseudoiridescens</em> Averincev, 1972; <em>Pista mirabilis </em>McIntosh 1885 and <em>Terebellides malvinensis</em> Bremec & Elias, 1999 constitute new records for Burdwood Bank. A similar polychaete assemblage characterized the three areas of NMPA and slope locations, while <em>H</em>.<em> artifex</em> characterized locations at the NW deepest slope of the bank. <strong>Conclusions:</strong> These results indicate strong connections between the fauna collected at NMPA and the polychaetes assemblage in other Magellan areas dominated by soft bottoms.

The relationship between interannual variability in atmospheric circulation, dictated by the climatic oscillation indices, and the benthic macrofauna composition was assessed at four sampling sites located in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer (NW Mediterranean Sea). Between 2004 and 2013, these sites were sampled annually during autumn/winter and analyzed for sediment grain‐size and benthic macrofauna composition (species richness, abundance, and biomass). Temporal changes in these descriptors were correlated with two climatic indices (NAO and WeMO indices) and a set of environmental parameters integrated over three different time periods (i.e., whole year, springtime, and wintertime). Our results confirm the occurrence of major temporal changes in the composition of macrobenthic communities within the Gulf of Lions. More specifically, the results indicate that (a) the WeMO appears to be more closely related to benthic macrofauna composition in the Bay of Banyuls‐sur‐Mer than the NAO, (b) winter is a better integration period than spring or the whole year as a proxy for community composition changes, and (c) Rhône River water flow is likely involved in the control of benthic macrofauna composition in the whole Gulf of Lions.

Most of them originated from the Mediterranean Sea. The Sea of Marmara, formed as a result of the paleogeographic evolution of the region, is an isolated sea between the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea with different oceanographic characteristics because of the density differences of both connected seas. This feature makes the Sea of Marmara important among the world's seas. The different and sudden deep basins, which reach a depth of more than 1000 meters depending on the geological history of the Sea of Marmara, show different physical and chemical properties. Numerous species that adapt to these varying conditions also form the biological diversity of these environments. Of these, an important group is the foraminiferal community. This group is extremely diverse and is represented by different taxa distributed in the shelf and deep environments of the Sea of Marmara. The surveys that have been made up to date show that every new study has brought the addition of new taxa to the known biological diversity of the Sea of Marmara.

Here we performed a spatiotemporally‐broad 16S rRNA gene analysis using 109 samples from sea cucumber feces and habitat sediments to explore potential contribution of their gut microbiota to the ecological roles. Most operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed in the fecal samples were shared with the sediment samples, nevertheless fecal and sediment microbiota differed from each other in UniFrac analysis. Lower bacterial diversity and increased relative abundance of specific OTUs in the fecal microbiota strongly suggest selective enrichment of ingested sediment microbiota in their guts. Interestingly, representative fecal OTUs were more abundant in sea cucumber‐populated sediments than in un‐inhabited sediments, indicating bacteria selectively enriched in the guts were spread on ambient sediments via feces. Moreover, the predicted microbial community metabolic potential showed a higher abundance of genes related to carbohydrate and xenobiotics metabolisms in feces than in sediments. Our study suggests the repeated selective enrichment transforms ambient sediment microbial communities and maintains the host's ecological roles by promoting organic matter mineralization.","Yamazaki, Y.; Sakai, Y.; Mino, S.; Suda, W.; Hattori, M.; Meirelles, P.M.; Thompson, F.L.; Sawabe, T.",WOS:000488377000001,"Yamazaki, Yohei, Y.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1758-2229.12791,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Hokkaido Univ, Fac Fisheries Sci, Lab Microbiol, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan.",Japan,,APOSTICHOPUS-JAPONICUS; EARTHWORM GUT; STICHOPUS-CHLORONOTUS; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; DISEASE RESISTANCE; HOLOTHURIA-SCABRA; FEEDING-ACTIVITY; GROWTH; BIOTURBATION; COMMUNITIES,Environmental Sciences; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology,,,,,,

Universitat de Girona: Girona.  41 pp.","Heterobranchs are a taxonomy subclass with scientific interest for its adaptations, its feeding and for metabolic compounds that synthesize or can storage. Useful compounds for cancer studies have been discovered. Habitat plays an important role in the ecology of heterobranch, but little is known in the Mediterranean. In this study, evaluation two different habitats where heterobranch inhabitat, seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica and rocky littoral, will be evaluated. Will also be studied the effect of depth factor on population abundance and species richness of heterobranch in posidonia seagrass meadows. Heterobranch distribution is linked with its feeding and consequently with its habitat. Posidonia seagrass meadows are recognized in several scientific studies because they can offer habitat to many benthic and nektonic fauna and flora. Posidonia meadows are included in the Habitats Directive as a habitat of interest and they are protected. Rocky littoral is a habitat with high availability of nutrients and light that is idoneal for sponge colonies, cnidaria colonies, algae and tunicate. In my study I found that despite light intensity in marine ecology is linked with depth, this factor is not linked to heterobranch abundance and richness in posidonia seagrass meadows. Habitat factor is significative: higher abundance and richness have been found on rocky littoral than posidonia meadows. Identification of heterobranch species is difficult due to its size, therefore photographic support can be helpful. My study shows a photography of all species inventory to facilitate its identification, as well as its habitat and the feeding of heterobranch in order to create a technical sheet that facilitate its location in future studies. The methodology used in this study for heterobranch inventory is innovative and can be useful for further studies in the future.","Altimiras, M.B.",,"Altimiras, Margot Bosch, M.B.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,BA,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predator invasion success may be attributed to prey naïveté, or the absence of anti-predator behavior between native and non-native species. An understanding of the effects of naïveté at different timescales since introduction and across multiple trophic levels is lacking, however, particularly in marine systems. Given the central role of trophic interactions in invasion dynamics, this knowledge gap limits the ability to predict high impact predator invasions. Naïveté was examined across three trophic levels of marine invertebrates: a native basal prey (hard clam), two non-native intermediate predators (the recently-introduced Asian shore crab and the long-established European green crab), a native intermediate predator (juvenile blue crabs), and a native top predator (adult blue crab). We hypothesized that naïveté would be more pronounced in trophic interactions involving the recently-introduced non-native predator in comparison to the long-established non-native and native intermediate predators. We further hypothesized that the recently-introduced intermediate predator would both benefit from naïveté of the native basal prey and be hindered by higher mortality through its own naïveté to the native top predator. To test these hypotheses, three laboratory experiments and a field experiment were used. Consistent with our hypotheses, basal prey naïveté was most pronounced with the recently-introduced intermediate predator, and this increased the predator’s foraging success. This recently-introduced intermediate predator, however, exhibited an ineffective anti-predator response to the native top predator, and was also preyed upon more in the field than its long-established and native counterparts. Therefore, despite direct benefits from basal prey naïveté, the recently-introduced intermediate predator’s naïveté to its own predators may limit its invasion success. These results highlight the importance of a multi-trophic perspective on predator-prey dynamics to more fully understand the consequences of naïveté in invasion biology.","Papacostas, K.J.; Freestone, A.L.",WOS:000532119700052,"Freestone, Amy, A.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0221969,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Natl Atmospher & Ocean Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",USA,,CRAB HEMIGRAPSUS-SANGUINEUS; ASIAN SHORE CRAB; CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS RATHBUN; CARCINUS-MAENAS; GREEN CRAB; BLUE-CRAB; INTRODUCED PREDATOR; ATLANTIC COAST; HARD CLAM; BEHAVIOR,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

The intertidal ecosystem is continually under pressure from both humans and the natural elements of waves and tidal shifts. The organisms that reside here must be able to tolerate extreme changes to physicochemical factors such as light, temperature, water movement, salinity and oxygen. Gastropods from phylum Mollusca are highly resistant and adaptable to extreme changes in the environment. This study investigates the diversity, abundance, and distribution of tropical intertidal gastropods in different areas. Also, it examines how shell morphometrics and biomass affect these factors. Sampling was done in Pantai Pasir Cina (PPC) and Pantai Pasir Pengkalan (PPP) at Pulau Bidong, Malaysia in August 2018. Transect lines of 60 m × 10 m were laid out perpendicular to the shore. Six quadrats of 1 m<sup>2</sup> were placed at three tidal zonation’s: high, mid, and low tide. A total of 1326 individual gastropods represented by eight families (Littorinidae, Muricidae, Planaxidae, Siphonariidae, Neritidae, Nacillidae, Patellidae and Trochidae) were recorded, along with five subclasses namely Ceanogastropoda, Heterobranchia, Neritimorpha, Patellogastropoda and Vetigastropoda. A total number of 19 species were recorded from both study sites. The Shannon diversity index, H’ showed that at the intertidal zones at both locations the diversity was less than two, indicating low diversity. In contrast, Simpson’s index, D at all intertidal zones at both sites had values of almost one, indicating a high level of dominance. This pattern is also seen for evenness indices such as J’ and Ep’ where all values are close to one, which indicates complete evenness for all tidal zones. The diversity t-test revealed significant differences between the sites of PPC and PPP, t (1192.5) = -4.9652, p < 0.05. The SHE analysis of the two sites showed a lognormal pattern. Community structures of intertidal zones at PPC and PPP are between ‘more equally’ and ‘very equally’ and fall under the ‘good’ or the ‘very good’ categories.

The relationships of marginelliform gastropods within the order Neogastropoda are controversial, and the monophyly of the two marginelliform families the Marginellidae J. Fleming, 1828 and the Cystiscidae Stimpson, 1865, remains unconfirmed. DNA sequence data have never been used to assess the relationships of the marginelliform gastropods, making this group the only major branch missing in our current understanding of the neogastropod tree of life. Here we report results of the first multilocus phylogenetic analysis of marginelliform gastropods, which is based on a dataset comprising 63 species (20 genera) of Marginellidae and Cystiscidae, and a wide range of neogastropod lineages. The Marginellidae and Cystiscidae form a moderately supported clade that is sister to the family Volutidae. <em>Marginellona gigas</em> appears to be sister to all other marginelliforms. The subfamily Marginellinae was recovered as a well-supported clade, and good resolution of this part of the tree makes it possible to propose amendments to the family-level classification of the group. The relationship between <em>Granulina</em> and other marginelliforms could not be resolved and requires further study. Due to poor resolution of basal relationships within the Marginellidae–Cystiscidae clade, the monophyly of the Cystiscidae was neither confirmed nor convincingly rejected. The shell morphology of most marginellid and cystiscid genera is taxonomically not very informative but, nevertheless, of the traditionally recognized genera only <em>Gibberula</em> and <em>Dentimargo</em> were shown to be polyphyletic. Although a comprehensive systematic revision of the group requires more extensive taxonomic sampling (e.g. with better representation of the type species of nominal genus-group names), our results support the superfamily Volutoidea, comprising four families (Volutidae, Cystiscidae, Marginellidae and Marginellonidae), with the placement of the Granulinidae uncertain for the time being.","Fedosov, A.E.; Gutierrez, M.C.; Buge, B.; Sorokin, P.V.; Puillandre, N.; Bouchet, P.",WOS:000515118500007,"Gutierrez, Manuel, M.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyz028,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversiti ISYEB, UMR 7205,CNRS,UPMC,EPHE, 55 Rue Buffon,CP26, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,,SYSTEMATICS; CLASSIFICATION; MOLLUSCA; MORPHOLOGY; GENUS,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,"Joint Research Unit: Institue of Systematics, Evolution, Biodiversity (ISYEB) (UMR 7205)",x,France,,Research network,Science

Some multivariate analyses using BD samples indicated the presence of three assemblages, but these seem to represent different facies of a single benthic community due to the absence of acute sediment changes and significant differences in the fauna. OT samples only displayed differences related to seasons but not to sediment types or depth. These seasonal differences seem to be linked to biological and ecological features of both dominant and/or commercial species. Mud and organic matter contents (%OM) in sediment, as well as the temperature, were the main variables linked to the spatial distribution of the benthic community identified with BD, whereas medium and coarse sand as well as gravel contents were the main variables linked to the changes of the epibenthic and demersal assemblage resulting from OT samples.

Development of the western Limfjord, Denmark, after the last deglaciation: a review with new data. <i>Bull. Geol. Soc. Denmark 67</i>: 53-73","This paper presents new marine evidence of Lateglacial and Holocene environmental changes in the western part of Limfjorden, and provides a review of the geological history/development of this part of northern Jylland, Denmark. Lateglacial clay without fossils is widespread in the region and is probably a glaciolacustrine deposit. Limfjorden began to form as a strait in the Early Holocene due to rising relative sea level and the oldest marine shells are dated to c. 9300 cal. years BP. We propose a new relative sealevel curve for the region based on new and published data, which appear to confirm that the relative sea-level change was not extremely rapid, which was suggested earlier. During the Mid-Holocene a wide connection existed from the western part of Limfjorden to the North Sea in the west and more narrow connections existed between Limfjorden and Skagerrak in the north. The marine fauna included several species that indicate warmer and more salty waters than at present. Gradually, the connections to the North Sea and Skagerrak closed due to long-shore sediment transport and deposition of aeolian sand combined with a fall in the relative sea level during the Middle- to Late Holocene. During the Viking Age, 800–1050 CE (Common Era), the western connection to the North Sea was still open, but around 1200 CE it was closed by a coastal sandy barrier and the western part of Limfjorden became brackish. The coastal barrier was flooded on several occasions but soon formed again. After 1825 CE the western connection from Limfjorden to the North Sea has been maintained artificially.","Bennike, O.; Nørgaard-Pedersen, N.; Jensen, J.B.; Andresen, K.J.; Seidenkrantz, M.-S.",WOS:000487269700001,"Nørgaard-Pedersen, Niels, N.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Holocene, Lateglacial, relative sea-level changes, salinity changes, Limfjorden, Denmark",Journal article,,,"Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, CF Mellers Alle 8, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",Denmark,Holocene; Lateglacial; relative sea-level changes; salinity changes; Limfjorden,SHORE-LEVEL CHANGES; SEA-LEVEL; NORTHERN DENMARK; PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION; HOLOCENE TEMPERATURE; RESERVOIR AGES; BALTIC SEA; DEPOSITS; REGION; FORAMINIFERA,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,,,,,,

Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade‐off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long‐term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, ‘node‐weighted’ food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node‐weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.","Olivier, P.; Frelat, R.; Bonsdorff, E.; Kortsch, S.; Kröncke, I.; Möllmann, C.; Neumann, H.; Sell, A.F.; Nordström, M.C.",WOS:000501362200011,"Olivier, Pierre, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.04461,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland.",Finland,food web structure; temporal variability; topology,NORTH-SEA; REGIME SHIFT; MACROFAUNA COMMUNITIES; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; TROPHIC LEVELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STEADY-STATE; FISH; ECOSYSTEM,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Åbo Akademi University - Department of Bioscience Environment and Marine Biology,x,Finland,,University,Science

We collected environmental and larval trait data for 170 species from the literature, and utilized a complete thoracican synthesis tree to account for phylogenetic nonindependence. In accordance with Thorson's rule, the fraction of species with planktonic‐feeding larvae declined with water depth and increased with water temperature, while the fraction of brooding species exhibited the reverse pattern. Species with planktonic‐nonfeeding larvae were overall rare, following no apparent trend. In agreement with the “size advantage” hypothesis proposed by Strathmann in 1977, egg and larval size were closely correlated. Settlement‐competent cypris larvae were larger in cold water, indicative of advantages for large juveniles when growth is slowed. Planktonic larval duration, on the other hand, was uncorrelated to environmental variables.

These systems lack abiotic three-dimensional structures but host biogenic structures that play critical roles in controlling abiotic conditions and resources. Here I review how reef-building polychaetes (RBP) engineer their environment and affect habitat quality, thus regulating community structure, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services in shallow waters. The analysis focuses on different engineering mechanisms, such as hard substrate production, effects on hydrodynamics, and sediment transport, and impacts mediated by filter feeding and biodeposition. Finally, I deal with landscape-level topographic alteration by RBP. In conclusion, RBP have positive impacts on diversity and abundance of many species mediated by the structure of the reef. Additionally, by feeding on phytoplankton and decreasing water turbidity, RBP can control primary production, increase light penetration, and might alleviate the effects of eutrophication affecting supporting ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. They can also modulate cultural ecosystem services by affecting recreational activities (e.g., negative impacts on boating and angling, increased value of sites as birdwatching sites). Acknowledging the multiplicity of synergistic and antagonistic effects of RBP on ecosystems and linking changes in habitat structure, filter-feeding activities, and biodeposition to ecosystem services are essential for effective decision-making regarding their management and restoration.","Bruschetti, M.",WOS:000487944500011,"Bruschetti, Martín, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d11090168,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,polychaetes; ecosystem engineers; reef-building; filter-feeding; ecosystem services,Journal article,,,"Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Lab Ecol, FCEyN, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina.",Argentina,polychaetes; ecosystem engineers; reef-building; filter-feeding; ecosystem services,LANICE-CONCHILEGA PALLAS; CHIQUITA COASTAL LAGOON; SABELLARIA-ALVEOLATA POLYCHAETA; FICOPOMATUS-ENIGMATICUS FAUVEL; BIOGENIC REEFS; BOCCARDIA-PROBOSCIDEA; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; PARTICLE RETENTION,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Stocks of <i>Stolothrissa tanganicae</i> and <i>Limnothrissa miodon</i> have been declining over the years due to overfishing, climate change and other anthropogenic factors. It is important to have ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) to avoid overfishing in the lake. To establish EBFM, it is vital to assess the biology and ecological interactions of the fish. The Lake Tanganyika sardines are an important link between zooplankton and larger fish within the pelagic food web. This study conducted a metabarcoding technique on the stomach content of the sardines to examine their prey item composition. It investigated whether the prey composition in the stomach varied between sardine species, location, season, sex and length. The results showed significant differences in prey composition between species. Limnothrissa miodon had a more diverse diet compared to S. tanganicae. A significant difference was also found between locations and seasons, probably due to the limnology of the lake and the spatial and temporal variability of both biotic and abiotic factors. The diet composition varied with varying standard length for S. tanganicae but not for L. miodon. Genetic material from multiple phyla was found in the stomachs of the sardines, including cnidarian DNA. Future changes in population dynamics of both the sardines and their prey due to overfishing, climate change or other anthropogenic factors could impact the whole pelagic ecosystem. It is important to identify these dynamics and establish international EBFM plans.","Huyghe, C.E.T.",,"Huyghe, Charlotte, C.E.T.",KU Leuven: Laboratorium voor Biodiversiteit en Evolutionaire Genomica (KULeuven-LBEG),,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Limnothrissa miodon, ""Stolothrissa tanganicae""",,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Catholique University of Louvain - Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Genomics (LBEG),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Given that prospective mining operations are likely to have profound impacts on deep seafloor communities, industrial investment has been accompanied by scientific involvement for the assessment of baseline conditions and provision of guidelines for environmentally sustainable mining practices. Benthic meiofaunal communities were studied in four prospective mining areas of the Clarion–Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific Ocean, arranged in a southeast–northwest fashion coinciding with the productivity gradient in the area. Additionally, samples were collected from the Area of Particular Environmental Interest no. 3 (APEI-3) in the northwest of the CCZ, where mining will be prohibited and which should serve as a “source area” for the biota within the larger CCZ. Total densities in the 0–5 cm upper layer of the sediment were influenced by sedimentary characteristics, water depth and nodule density at the various sampling locations, indicating the importance of nodules for meiofaunal standing stock. Nematodes were the most abundant meiobenthic taxon, and their assemblages were typically dominated by a few genera (generally 2–6) accounting for 40 %–70 % of all individuals, which were also widely spread along the CCZ and shared among all sampled license areas. However, almost half of the communities consisted of rare genera, each contributing less than 5 % to the overall abundances and displaying a distribution which was usually restricted to a single license area.

To address this, we conducted two oceanographic campaigns throughout the maximum (April) and minimum (November) rainfall period of 2015. A total of 24 stations were delimited around the archipelago, in the proximities of the 50 and 500 m isobaths (closer and farther areas). Water samples were collected between 1 and 100 m with a 10 L Niskin bottle and fixed with lugol. A CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth profiler) was used to obtain temperature and salinity profiles. Surface temperature and salinity presented minor variation and the depth of the onset of thermocline varied between 16 and 63 m. An increase in polycystine radiolarians density was observed with the proximity to the archipelago, with higher values during the minimum rainfall period (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). This increase may be associated with a higher concentration of food items in closer areas. The structure of the assemblage was also influenced by distance and rainfall regime (PERMANOVA, P < 0.001), and shifts in the proportion of the relative abundance of rare species were the main cause. A total of 78 taxa were identified and a large portion of the assemblage was composed by juveniles, especially in closer areas, limiting proper identification. Thus, higher densities and a higher proportion of juveniles were observed closer to the archipelago in relation to farther areas.","da Costa, A.E.S.F.; de Santana, J.R.; de Castro Melo, P.A.M.; Neumann-Leitão, S.",WOS:000485906300009,"de Santana, Jana Ribeiro, J.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s42965-019-00030-3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; Equatorial Atlantic; Microzooplankton ecology; Protist plankton ecology; Spatial distribution; Tropical microzooplankton,Journal article,,,"Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, Ave Arquitetura S-N, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.",Brazil,Biodiversity; Equatorial Atlantic; Microzooplankton ecology; Protist plankton ecology; Spatial distribution; Tropical microzooplankton,VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; TROPHIC ACTIVITY; MICROZOOPLANKTON; PRODUCTIVITY; ECOLOGY; COLUMN; SEA,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

However, the anatomical disparity found throughput the Terebridae provides a unique perspective for investigating diversification patterns in venomous predators. Here a new dated molecular phylogeny of the Terebridae is used as a framework for investigating diversification of the family through time, and for testing the putative role of intrinsic and extrinsic traits, such as shell size, larval ecology, bathymetric distribution, and anatomical features of the venom apparatus, as drivers of terebrid species diversification. Macroevolutionary analysis revealed that while diversification rates do not vary across Terebridae clades, the whole family has been increasing its global diversification rate since 25 Ma. We recovered evidence for a concurrent increase in diversification of depth ranges, while shell size appeared to have undergone a fast divergence early in terebrid evolutionary history. Our data also confirms that planktotrophy is the ancestral larval ecology in terebrids, and evolutionary modeling highlighted that shell size is linked to larval ecology of the Terebridae, with species with long-living pelagic larvae tending to be larger and have a broader size range than lecithotrophic species. While we recovered patterns of size and depth trait diversification through time and across clades, the presence or absence of a venom gland did not appear to have impacted Terebridae diversification. Terebrids have lost their venom apparatus several times and we confirm that the loss of a venom gland happened in phylogenetically clustered terminal taxa and that reversal is extremely unlikely. Our findings suggest environmental factors, and not venom, has had more influence on terebrid evolution.","Modica, M.V.; Gorson, J.; Fedosov, A.E.; Malcolm, G.; Terryn, Y.; Puillandre, N.; Holford, M.",WOS:000537435800001,"Malcolm, Gavin, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/sysbio/syz059,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Terebridae,,,"Macroevolution, Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCM), venom, Conidae, diversification",Journal article,,,"Hunter Coll, Belfer Res Ctr, Dept Chem, 413 E 69th St,BRB 424, New York, NY 10021 USA.",USA,Terebridae; macroevolution; phylogenetic comparative methods; venom; Conidae; diversification,SPECIES-RICHNESS; ECOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY; BODY-SIZE; REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES; BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES; STABILIZING SELECTION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; EXTINCTION RISK,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,

Although many studies are available for the region, there is a need for a general overview of the best available information. Here, we assembled a comprehensive collection of environmental data and briefly described the ocean climatology and its variability in the Azores. Data sources used in this study included remote sensing oceanographic data for 2003–2013 (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon), derived oceanographic data (primary productivity and North Atlantic oscillation index) for 2003–2013, and in situ data (temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate) obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. We have produced 78 geographic datasets of environmental data for the Azores region that were deposited at the World Data Center Pangaea and also made available at the SIGMAR Azores website. As with previous studies, our results confirmed a high spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the marine environment in the Azores region, typical of mid-latitudes. For example, lower sea surface temperature was found in the northern part of the study area coinciding with higher values for chlorophyll-a concentration, net primary production (NPP), and particulate organic and inorganic carbon. Higher values for some of these parameters were also found on island slopes and some seamounts. Compiled data on the environmental conditions at near-seabed revealed some notable variations across the study area (e.g., oxygen and nutrients) and with depth (e.g., temperature, salinity, and oxygen). Knowledge of these patterns will help improve our understanding of the distribution of many deep-sea organisms such as fish, cold-water corals, and sponges, thereby supporting the implementation of marine spatial planning and other management measures. It should be noted that the assembled datasets suffer from a number of limitations related to the accuracy of remote sensing and global bathymetry data, or to the limited and unevenly distributed collection of environmental observations. Accordingly, an effective observing system for detecting oceanic change with adequate accuracy and precision is still required.","Amorim, P.; Peran, A.D.; Pham, C.K.; Juliano, M.; Cardigos, F.; Tempera, F.; Morato, T.",WOS:000457690600056,"Peran, Antonio, A.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2017.00056,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction: From a global point of view, polychaetes that inhabit in the pelagic community have been little studied, although they are an important link in the food chains of marine ecosystems. Objective: to analyze the local richness and density of polychaetes. Methods: Plankton samples were taken in 17 localities during May and December 2013, through surface trawls in a barge with an outboard motor. We used a net with 0.3 m mouth diameter, 1.30 m long and a 0.3 mm aperture mesh. From each collected sample, polychaetes were separated and determined at the lowest possible taxonomic level. Results: We collected a total of 1 873 individuals, with an important variation in relative density, since in May 7 952.0 ind/100m3 were recorded, while in December there were only 882.1 ind/100m3. The differences in the composition and density of the determined polychaetes, were analyzed, of which the highest proportion belongs to the larval forms of the benthic (meroplankton) populations, and the lowest proportion to holoplankton organisms. During the two periods of study were observed thirteen families, from which Sabellariidae, Spionidae, Chaetopteridae, Magelonidae, Iospilidae and Typhloscolecidae were common in both periods, while Aphroditidae, Syllidae, Phyllodocidae and Alciopidae were observed only in May, and Serpulidae, Sabellidae and Lopadorhynchidae were observed only in December.

We hereby highlight and summarize Raffaello Bellini’s biography and malacological work, and revise the status of recent molluscan taxa described by him. Our bibliographic research revealed that from 1897 to 1929 Bellini published 41 papers dealing with malacology and altogether instituted 46 molluscan nominal taxa, 17 of which are based on fossil samples and 29 on recent samples. Within the latter group, 24 (13 marine, nine terrestrial, and two freshwater) taxa are potentially available, whilst five (two marine and three terrestrial) are nomina nuda. Among these 24 taxa, 13 are available, ten have infrasubspecific rank and thus are not available, and one is permanently invalid. Among available binomial names, seven are junior synonyms of valid taxa and six are nomina dubia. <i>Gibbula umbilicaris</i> var. acherusiae Bellini, 1903 is here considered a junior synonym of <i>Gibbula ardens</i> (Salis Marschlins, 1793) for the first time. Finally, three recent marine molluscan taxa were named after Raffaello Bellini. However, none of these species proved to be valid. The present paper sheds light on the work done by the latest of the “early” authors of the Neapolitan Malacological School and contributes to nomenclature and taxonomy of Recent European molluscan taxa.","Fasulo, G.; Duraccio, S.; Federico, A.; Crocetta, F.",WOS:000485217500003,"Duraccio, Sergio, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.11646/zootaxa.4668.3.3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"history of malacology, biography, bibliography, alpha taxonomy, nomenclature",Journal article,,,"Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Villa Comunale, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",Italy,history of malacology; biography; bibliography; alpha taxonomy; nomenclature,CRYPTIC LINEAGES; GASTROPODA,Zoology,Zoology,Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli (SZN),x,Italy,,Research institute,Science

Three species were identified based on GenBank sequences and the external morphology of the externa. In addition, this study proposes four new candidate species. This is the first report on the family Peltogastridae from Korea. Six hermit crab species were found to be new hosts to peltogastrids. Korean peltogastrids are less prevalent on their host hermit crabs than those from Japan are, especially in the west coast of Korea. Peltogasterella gracilis is widely distributed throughout Korea, Peltogaster lineata is located on the east coast, and Peltogaster postica is only located on Jeju Island.","Jung, J.; Yoshida, R.; Kim, W.",WOS:000496562800001,"Yoshida, Ryuta, R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Paguroidea, ""Peltogaster lineata""",Ecology,,"Parasitic barnacle; Morphology, DNA barcode; Biogeography",Journal article,,,"Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",South Korea,Parasitic barnacle; Paguroidea; Morphology; DNA barcode; Ecology; Biogeography,ISLAND RYUKYU ARCHIPELAGO; DNA; DECAPODA; GENUS; PAGURIDAE; HISTORY; JAPAN; COAST,Zoology,Zoology,Seoul National University - School of Biological Science,x,South Korea,,University,Science

In this study, spatial patterns and drivers of nematode density and genus composition were investigated at two different spatial scales (i.e. meso- and microscale), with drivers including sediment granulometry, inundation period and food availability as indicated by various phytopigments. Our study has shown that specific food sources, as represented by different pigments and measures of freshness, are important drivers of nematode genus composition and densities at both scales, especially for the surface layers of the sediments. These food sources mainly comprise microphytobenthos, but also deposited phytodetritus and zooplankton faecal pellets, a resource which had hitherto been largely overlooked in intertidal flats. Tidal level and grain size also had a more pronounced structuring effect in the surface layer of the sediment, while their assumed larger importance at the mesoscale was not outspoken. At both scales, vertical heterogeneity in nematode assemblages was larger than horizontal variability, which has repercussions for future studies into the spatial variability of nematode assemblages of tidal flats.","Wu, X.; Vanreusel, A.; Hauquier, F.; Moens, T.",WOS:000489940900001,"Wu, Xiuqin, X.","Marine Biological Laboratory, Biology Department, Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-019-04064-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Microphytobenthos; Sediment granulometry; Mesoscale; Microscale ,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Biol Dept, Marine Biol Lab, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Microphytobenthos; Sediment granulometry; Mesoscale; Microscale,LIVING MARINE NEMATODES; SANDY-BEACH; TIDAL FLAT; ORGANIC-MATTER; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; TROPHIC POSITION; FEEDING ECOLOGY; FINE-SCALE; NORTH-SEA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Understanding how this provisioning will change in the Anthropocene requires knowledge of marine biodiversity patterns. Here, we review the status of marine species diversity in space and time. Knowledge of marine species diversity is incomplete, with only 11% of species described. Nonetheless, marine biodiversity is clearly under threat, and habitat destruction and overexploitation represent the greatest stressors to threatened marine species. Claims that global marine extinction rates are within historical backgrounds and lower than on land may be inaccurate, as fewer marine species have been assessed for extinction risk. Moreover, extinctions and declines in species richness at any spatial scale may inadequately reflect marine diversity trends. Marine local-scale species richness is seemingly not decreasing through time. There are, however, directional changes in species composition at local scales. These changes are non-random, as resident species are replaced by invaders, which may reduce diversity in space and, thus, reduce regional species richness. However, this is infrequently quantified in the marine realm and the consequences for ecosystem processes are poorly known. While these changes in species richness are important, they do not fully reflect humanity’s impact on the marine realm. Marine population declines are ubiquitous, yet the consequences for the functioning of marine ecosystems are understudied. We call for increased emphasis on trends in abundance, population sizes and biomass of marine species to fully characterize the pervasiveness of anthropogenic impacts on the marine realm.","Luypaert, T.; Hagan, J.G.; McCarthy, M.L.; Poti, M.",WOS:000582468900004,"Luypaert, Thomas, T.","Faculty of Sciences and Bioengineering Sciences, Department of Biology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_4,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Extinction; Defaunation; Biotic homogenization; Conservation; Anthropogenic stressors; Ecosystem function;; Ecosystem service; Marine threats ,Book chapters,Conference paper,,"Univ Firenze UniFi, Fac Maths Phys & Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",Italy,Extinction; Defaunation; Biotic homogenization; Conservation; Anthropogenic stressors; Ecosystem function; Ecosystem service; Marine threats,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; SPECIES RICHNESS; EXTINCTION RISK; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TROPHIC CASCADES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; POSITIVE FEEDBACKS; RESERVES ENHANCE,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Free University of Brussels (VUB) - Faculty of Sciences and Bioengineering Sciences - Biology Department,,Belgium,o,University,Science

Based on collections from these new localities, we delineated a minimum of eight and up to 24 putative new species using a consensus from a range of molecular delineation methods and additional evidence. When we placed our new putative species into the broader phylogenetic framework of Australian Parabathynellidae, they grouped with two known genera and also within one new and distinct Pilbara-only clade. These new species significantly expand the known diversity of Parabathynellidae in that they represent a 22% increase to the 109 currently recognised species globally.

Although earlier authors recognized their diverse and heterochronic character, Redonian assemblages continued to be monographed as if they were homogeneous, hindering understanding. Here we critically review the lower Pliocene (Zanclean) Assemblage III gastropod faunas of the Nantes region (241 species within 145 genera) and consider their palaeoenvironmental and palaeobiogeographic implications. They occur in the wider context of a post-Miocene decrease in faunal diversity along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. This decline has been linked to the loss of thermophilic faunal elements due to a cooling in Mean Monthly Sea Surface Temperature (MMSST). Based on Assemblage III gastropods, MMSSTs in the Ligerian Gulf of northwestern France was characterized by subtropical temperatures in Zanclean times (not cooler than approximately 16ºC in February to 22ºC in August and September, compared to present day values of 9.5ºC to 18.5ºC for this latitude). At generic level, the Assemblage III fauna lies at the northern limit of the subtropical French-Iberian molluscan province, which also included the Pliocene faunas of the Mondego Basin of Portugal. However, at species level, it is unlike other Redonian or French-Iberian assemblages of Pliocene age and justifies the creation of a distinct Ligerian molluscan subprovince. The origin and evolution of the assemblage were strongly dependent on the geography of northwestern France during the Pliocene; once the Ligerian Gulf vanished, so did the subprovince.","Landau, B.M.; Marques da Silva, C.; Van Dingenen, F.; Ceulemans, L.",WOS:000508751800019,"Marques da Silva, Carlos, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109387,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Paleozoology; Mollusca; Zanclean; Loire-Atlantique; Biodiversity; Paleogeography,Journal article,,,"Nat Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Paleozoology; Molluscs; Zanclean; Loire-Atlantique; Biodiversity; Palaeogeography,PIGEON BLANC (LOIRE-ATLANTIQUE; ATLANTO-MEDITERRANEAN BIOGEOGRAPHY; UPPER MIOCENE GASTROPODS; MIO-PLIOCENE; LOIRE-ATLANTIQUE; NEOGENE; NEOGASTROPODA; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; EVOLUTION,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Paleontology",Physical Geography; Geology; Paleontology,Naturalis Biodiversity Center,x,Netherlands,,Museum,Science

Although pigment and lipid derivatives are the major groups of bioactive compounds found in crinoids and ophiuroids, saponins represent the most abundant and diverse marine natural products (MNPs) in the phylum Echinodermata. This review is for researchers that are interested in MNPs derived from echinoderms, but with a particular focus on the structural diversity and biological function of saponins. Among the echinoderms, these steroidal compounds are mostly known for and structurally most diverse within sea cucumbers. Through compilation of extensive tables, this review provides a reference book, summarizing not only the major chemical classes of well-known secondary metabolites in the phylum Echinodermata but also further focusing on the presence of bioactive saponins in echinoderms in general and within different sea cucumber species in particular. The final compilation aims to correlate the vast structural diversity of saponins with known biological functions. The here presented data revealed that holothurians, holotoxins, cucumariosides, and echinosids are not only the most abundant saponin compounds in various genera of sea cucumbers but that these saponins can also be used as potential chemotaxonomic markers for different sea cucumber species. By studying the structure-function relationships of triterpene glycosides in echinoderms in general, or in particular within holothurians, the vast structural diversity, taxonomic distribution, and bioactivity of the molecules can be deciphered, which provides an opportunity to focus future research efforts on target species that contain MNPs with novel pharmacological activities.","Kamyab, E.; Kellermann, M.Y.; Kunzmann, A.; Schupp, P.J.",WOS:000582468900007,"Kellermann, Matthias, M.Y.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Secondary metabolites; Chemical diversity; Taxonomic markers; Structure-function analysis; Saponins; Echinoderms; Sea cucumber ,Journal article,,,"Univ Oldenburg HIFMB, Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, Oldenburg, Germany.",Germany,Secondary metabolites; Chemical diversity; Taxonomic markers; Structure-function analysis; Saponins; Echinoderms; Sea cucumber,STEROIDAL GLYCOSIDE SULFATES; CYTOTOXIC TRITERPENE GLYCOSIDES; FUCOSYLATED CHONDROITIN SULFATE; STARFISH CULCITA-NOVAEGUINEAE; MARINE NATURAL-PRODUCTS; NF-KAPPA-B; EUPENTACTA FRAUDATRIX.

The sedimentologic analysis carried on four cross-sections exhibits a complete Quaternary series that begin with basal erosive surface and marine deposits attributed to the last interglacial period. The Pleistocene deposits represent a 3rd-order sequence that is divided into 2 (4th–5th order) shallowing-upward sequences that are interpreted as a response to glacio-eustatic events. The lower sequence consists mainly of shoreface facies which evolve to foreshore and continental facies. The upper sequence shows a dune facies with cross-stratification and continental gastropods (eolian deposit interbedded with red to gray paleosoils).

Despite growing interest in a trait‐based approach to the biodiversity of the deep sea, where the impacts of human activities (including seabed mining) accelerate, there is no single repository for species traits for deep‐sea chemosynthesis‐based ecosystems, including hydrothermal vents. Using an international, collaborative approach, we have compiled the first global‐scale trait database for deep‐sea hydrothermal‐vent fauna – sFDvent (sDiv‐funded trait database for the Functional Diversity of vents). We formed a funded working group to select traits appropriate to: (a) capture the performance of vent species and their influence on ecosystem processes, and (b) compare trait‐based diversity in different ecosystems. Forty contributors, representing expertise across most known hydrothermal‐vent systems and taxa, scored species traits using online collaborative tools and shared workspaces. Here, we characterise the sFDvent database, describe our approach, and evaluate its scope. Finally, we compare the sFDvent database to similar databases from shallow‐marine and terrestrial ecosystems to highlight how the sFDvent database can inform cross‐ecosystem comparisons. We also make the sFDvent database publicly available online by assigning a persistent, unique DOI. Main types of variable contained: Six hundred and forty‐six vent species names, associated location information (33 regions), and scores for 13 traits (in categories: community structure, generalist/specialist, geographic distribution, habitat use, life history, mobility, species associations, symbiont, and trophic structure). Contributor IDs, certainty scores, and references are also provided. Spatial location and grain: Global coverage (grain size: ocean basin), spanning eight ocean basins, including vents on 12 mid‐ocean ridges and 6 back‐arc spreading centres.

These are embedded in a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a cascade of events following perturbations such as species extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the inferred global metaweb of marine fish—that is, all possible potential feeding links between co-occurring species—is highly connected geographically with a low degree of spatial modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations because of high robustness at most locations.","Albouy, C.; Archambault, P.; Appeltans, W.; Araujo, M.B.; Beauchesne, D.; Cazelles, K.; Cirtwill, A.R.; Fortin, M.-J.; Galiana, N.; Leroux, S.J.; Pellissier, L.; Poisot, T.; Stouffer, D.B.; Wood, S.A.; Gravel, D.",WOS:000477903700009,"Beauchesne, David, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41559-019-0950-y,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"IFREMER, Unite Ecol & Modeles Halieut, Nantes, France.",France,,BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; COMMUNITIES; PREDICTORS; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; ROBUSTNESS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,IFREMER - Department of Ecology and Models for Fisheries,x,France,,Governmental body,Policy

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) are important infrastructures facilitating free and open access to classical biological data from several sources in both temporal and spatial scales. Over the last ten years, high throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcoding data have become available, which constitute a great source of detailed occurrence data. Among the global sampling projects that have contributed to such data are Tara Oceans and the Ocean Sampling Day (OSD). Integration of classical and metabarcoding data may aid a more comprehensive assessment of the geographic range of species, especially of microscopic ones such as protists. Rare, small and cryptic species are often ignored in surveys or mis-assigned with the classical approaches. Here we show how integration of data from various sources can contribute to insight in the biogeography and diversity at the genus- and species-level using Chaetoceros as study system, one of the most diverse and abundant genera among marine planktonic diatoms. Chaetoceros records were extracted from GBIF and OBIS and literature data were collected by means of a Google Scholar search. Chaetoceros references barcodes where mapped against the metabarcode datasets of Tara Oceans (210 sites) and OSD (144 sites). We compared the resolution of different data sources in determining the global distribution of the genus and provided examples, at the species level, of detection of cryptic species, endemism and cosmopolitan or restricted distributions. Our results highlighted at genus level a comparable picture from the different sources but a more complete assessment when data were integrated.

The combined pressures of fishing activity and climate change have also made it a hotspot of global change amidst increasing concern about the worsening status of exploited marine species. To anticipate the impacts of global changes in the Mediterranean Sea, more integrated modelling approaches are needed, which can then help policymakers prioritize management actions and formulate strategies to mitigate impacts and adapt to changes. The aim of this study was to develop a holistic model of marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea with an explicit representation of the spatial, multispecies dynamics of exploited resources subject to the combined influence of climate variability and fishing pressure. To this end, we used the individual-based OSMOSE model (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystEms), including 100 marine species (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) representing about 95% of the total declared catch, at a high spatial resolution (400 km2) and a large spatial scale (the entire Mediterranean basin) – the first time such a resolution and scale have been modelled. We then combined OSMOSE with the NEMOMED 12 physical model and the Eco3M-S biogeochemical low trophic level model to build the end-to-end model, OSMOSE-MED. We fitted OSMOSE-MED model with observed or estimated biomass and commercial catch data using a likelihood approach and an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The outputs of OSMOSE-MED were then verified against observed biomass and catch data, and compared with independent datasets (MEDITS data, diet composition and trophic levels). The model results – at different hierarchical levels, from individuals to the scale of the ecosystem – were consistent with current knowledge of the structure, functioning and dynamics of the ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. While the model could be further improved in future iterations, all the modelling steps – the comprehensive representation of key ecological processes and feedback, the selective parameterization of the model, and the comparison with observed data in the validation process – strengthened the predictive performance of OSMOSE-MED and thus its relevance as an impact model to explore the future of marine biodiversity under scenarios of global change. It is a promising tool to support ecosystem-based fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea.","Moullec, F.; Velez, L.; Verley, P.; Barrier, N.; Ulses, C.; Carbonara, P.; Esteban, A.; Follesa, C.; Gristina, M.; Jadaud, A.; Ligas, A.; Díaz, E.L.; Maiorano, P.; Peristeraki, P.; Spedicato, M.T.; Thasitis, I.; Valls, M.; Guilhaumon, F.; Shin, Y.-J.",WOS:000496861900020,"Moullec, Fabien, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102179,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,Ecosystem model; Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management; OSMOSE model; NEMOMED model; Eco3M-S model; Global change,Journal article,,,"Univ Montpellier, Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat MARBEC, IFREMER, IRD,CNRS, Montpellier, France.",France,Ecosystem model; Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management; OSMOSE model; NEMOMED model; Eco3M-S model; Global change,ANCHOVY ENGRAULIS-ENCRASICOLUS; INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODEL; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM MODEL; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; FISHERIES CATCHES; PARAPENAEUS-LONGIROSTRIS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SARDINA-PILCHARDUS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS,Oceanography,Oceanography,,,,,,

Particularly, global warming is driving range contractions and expansions of tropical species, such as corals. The use of climatic projections, via species distribution models to predict species distributional shifts, can identify threaten species and help to set priority areas of conservation. In this study, we assessed if distributional shifts of 45 Atlantic reef-forming corals (scleractinian), and the main environmental variables driving their distributions, correlated with their phylogeny and/or their functional traits; i.e. whether expected contractions and expansions affected specific clades, or specific coral traits. We also estimated the potential loss and/or gain of species richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD) and phylogenetic species variability (PSV), as well as the phylogenetic structure of Atlantic reef communities (‘clustering’, ‘overdispersion’ or ‘randomness’), under a future climate scenario (A2-IPCC-2100). The potential loss of Atlantic corals in the future will be randomly distributed across their phylogeny, i.e. potential extinctions will not only affect one section of the phylogeny, therefore alleviating an inordinate loss of evolutionary history. Nearly all current and future communities presented a ‘random’ phylogenetic structure. No correlation was found between distributional shifts and coral traits. Environmental variables did not show a significant correlation with the phylogeny neither with coral traits.

Species belonging to isolated clades (high evolutionary distinctiveness) contribute to quantitative increases, or decreases, of PD and PSV, becoming crucial species for conservation.

It is a highly productive area, and it maintains a high diversity and abundance of seabird species. At the same time, the Patagonian Shelf experiences pressues, such as fisheries that have been identified as a main stressor for marine ecosystems worldwide, including being a principal cause of seabird population declines. Using the telecoupling framework - which incorporates natural and socioeconomic interactions over large distances - we present here a holistic look at the dynamics of threatened seabird- fisheries interactions for the Patagonian Shelf over space and time. Based on the best-available public data for seabird presence, we used machine learning and geographic information systems to model-predict the at-sea distribution of seabirds. Then, maps were overlaid with fisheries distributions to show spatial correlation and hotspots for co-occurrence between seabirds and fisheries. We found that even this remote corner of the Atlantic Ocean is globally connected to XXX nations and XXX other outside-stakeholders through fisheries. By identifying and characterizing the systems, flows, agents, causes and effects involved in this telecoupling process, we highlighted specific complexities, bottlenecks and sensitivities that must still be addressed to achieve both biodiversity conservation and management as well as fisheries sustainability not only in this study area, but worldwide.","Rey, A.R.; Huettmann, F.",WOS:000507643800004,"Huettmann, Falk, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jnc.2019.125748,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,biodiversity conservation; coupled human and nature systems; CHANS; fisheries bycatch; fisheries governance; Patagonia; seabird conservation,Journal article,,,"Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CADIC, Ctr Austral Invest Cient & Tecn, Ushuaia, Tierra Fuego, Argentina.",Argentina,Biodiversity conservation; Coupled human and nature systems; CHANS; Fisheries bycatch; Fisheries governance; Patagonia; Seabird conservation,BLACK-BROWED ALBATROSSES; FALKLAND ISLAND WATERS; STORM-PETRELS; DIET; FRAMEWORK; FOOD; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; DISCARDS; IMPACTS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

It comprises daily phytoplankton counts accompanied by physico-chemical measurements. As such, it provides valuable long-term record of changes and their underlying causes in the phytoplankton community around Helgoland. This work provides an updated check-list of the phytoplankton species encountered at the Helgoland Roads LTER station with additional taxonomic assessments from live net samples and scanning electron microscope surveys. Since the last check-list was published 11 additional taxa have been recorded for the first time comprising 9 diatom and 2 dinoflagellate species. Of the 9 diatom species 3 were Chaetoceros species: Chaetoceros anastomosans, C. pseudocurvisetus and C. lorenzianus (the latter identified by their resting cysts) which were all first recognised in September 2009. The toxic dinoflagellate Dinophysis tripos, and the bipolar centric diatom Odontella longicruris both were first observed in September 2015. The latest new record is the potentially toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii, first recorded in August 2017. All of the first records (with the exception of Dinophysis tripos) were first observed in semi-quantitative surveys based on live samples and SEM demonstrating that adding less frequent but very detailed assessments can complement high frequency counts of fixed samples as long as these data of different origin are linked efficiently to the individual sampling event and all metadata including representative pictorial metadata are recorded in a consistent manner. In this manner the enhanced checklist serves as a baseline against which long-term changes in phytoplankton potentially related to ecosystem state can be addressed.","Kraberg, A.; Kieb, U.; Peters, S.; Wiltshire, K.H.",WOS:000498582700001,"Kraberg, Alexandra, A.","Biol Anstalt Helgoland AWI, D-20127498 Helgoland, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1186/s10152-019-0528-8,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",North Sea,,"Biodiversity, ""Climate change"", ""New records""",,"Helgoland transects, Helgoland Roads, Long-term monitoring",Journal article,,,"Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Kurpromenade 201, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany.",Germany,Biodiversity; Helgoland transects; Helgoland Roads; New records; North Sea; Climate change; Long-term monitoring,ALEXANDRIUM-OSTENFELDII DINOPHYCEAE; PSEUDO-NITZSCHIA PERAGALLO; NORTH-SEA; PLANKTONIC DIATOMS; MARINE DIATOM; QUODDY REGION; GERMAN BIGHT; BACILLARIOPHYCEAE; DIVERSITY; BAY,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,,,,,,

They originated during the Eocene in the American region and then spread eastward, reaching a worldwide distribution in the Oligocene. This paper investigates the southernmost population of lepidocyclinids ever found along the Pacific coast of South America, located in the lower part of the Paracas Formation (Los Choros Member) of the East Pisco Basin of Peru. The examined Los Choros strata are composed of mixed siliciclastic-bioclastic coarse-grained deposits. The skeletal assemblage is dominated by large benthic foraminifera and mollusks with subordinate echinoids and barnacles, suggesting a deposition in a shallow, tropical, shelf environment with a moderate nutrient supply. The large benthic foraminiferal assemblage is largely dominated by <i>Lepidocyclina rdouvillei</i>. This species is extremely primitive, exhibiting ancestral characters such as a straight wall separating the protoconch and deuteroconch, very large principal auxiliary chambers and a poorly organized equatorial plane. The presence of common and primitive L. rdouvillei, supported by the associated occurrence of Polylepidina, suggests an age comprised between 43.6 Ma and 40.5 Ma for the Los Choros Member in the study area. This range is confirmed by nannofossil assemblages that indicate an age between 42.37 Ma and 40.34 Ma for the base of the overlying Yumaque Member of the Paracas Formation. These results highlight the potential of lepidocyclinids for biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in South America.","Coletti, G.; Bosio, G.; Collareta, A.; Malinverno, E.; Bracchi, V.C.; Di Celma, C.; Basso, D.; Stainbank, S.; Spezzaferri, S.; Cannings, T.; Bianucci, G.",WOS:000506715400040,"Bosio, Giulia, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jsames.2019.102372,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Lepidocyclina; Large benthic foraminifera; Eocene; Nepionic acceleration; Paracas Formation; Los Choros Member,Journal article,,,"Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sci Ambiente & Terr & Sci Terra, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",Italy,Lepidocyclina; Large benthic foraminifera; Eocene; Nepionic acceleration; Paracas Formation; Los Choros Member,MARINE VERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGE; LARGER BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; MIOCENE CHILCATAY FORMATION; LATE EOCENE; NAZCA RIDGE; CETACEA; WESTERN; NEPHROLEPIDINA; ODONTOCETI; MAMMALIA,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,,,,,,

Thanks to the scientific synergy generated by the flagship project of the artificial reefs (ARs) of Prado Bay, located off the coast of Marseille (France), a multi-annual biodiversity survey was performed by a team of recreational divers certified by the French Federation for Submarine Sports and Education (FFESSM). The analysis of their observations with other citizen science data showed a good taxonomic coverage for fishes and mollusks. These observations also allowed (1) to follow AR colonization over the study period, with the increasing number of taxa and the growing occurrence of large fishes, and (2) to characterize taxa distribution between the different AR types, revealing the inefficiency of one type of AR which failed to provide the results expected from its design. This example demonstrates that the transition from species identification to ecologically relevant observation is perfectly feasible using volunteer naturalist SCUBA divers, on condition that both the protocols and the data are validated by professional scientists.","Changeux, T.; Blazy, C.; Ruitton, S.",WOS:000489575900001,"Changeux, Thomas, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10750-019-04070-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,,,,Citizen science; SCUBA divers; Underwater monitoring; Artificial reef; Fish; Macro-benthos  ,Journal article,,,"Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, Oceanomed, Case 901,Campus Luminy, F-13228 Marseille 9, France.",France,Citizen science; SCUBA divers; Underwater monitoring; Artificial reef; Fish; Macro-benthos; Mediterranean,ARTIFICIAL REEFS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; VOLUNTEER; GULF; SEA; COLONIZATION; CONSERVATION; VARIABILITY; SCIENTISTS; MANAGEMENT,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The North Sea Open Science Conference organised by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform in 2016 aimed to take stock of the present-day scientific knowledge on the North Sea ecosystem, its interactions with human activities and its management. The conference was structured along three themes: (1) ‘the scientific backbone of the North Sea ecosystem: adequacy of the knowledge base?’, (2) ‘A new era in environmental monitoring and assessment: what is at stake?’, and (3) ‘Sustainability: one for all, all for one?’. Focusing on ‘open science’, we welcomed about 200 participants from around the North Sea with different backgrounds and interests in environmental sciences. The participants were challenged to reflect on current and future challenges for the North Sea management and, in particular, to explore possible nature-friendly solutions for addressing these challenges during a series of introductory oral (69) and poster (59) presentations, and World Café and Fish Bowl participatory sessions. The participants agreed on six main actions to (1) provide a solid scientific base for marine management decisions; (2) develop society-driven research; (3) increase interdisciplinary science; (4) recognise the need for system knowledge; (5) improve communication, knowledge exchange, and collective implementation of scientific knowledge; and (6) build integrated knowledge bases.

In combination with increasing ocean temperatures, these changes have been identified as a major sustainability threat to future marine life. Interactions between marine organisms are known to depend on biomolecules, although the influence of oceanic pH on their bioavailability and functionality remains unexplored. Here we show that global change substantially impacts two ecological keystone molecules in the ocean, the paralytic neurotoxins saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin. Increasing temperatures and declining pH increase the abundance of their toxic forms in the water. Our geospatial global model predicts where this increased toxicity could intensify the devastating impact of harmful algal blooms, for example through an increased incidence of paralytic shellfish poisoning. Calculations of future saxitoxin toxicity levels in Alaskan clams, <i>Saxidomus gigantea</i>, show critical exceedance of limits safe for consumption. Our findings for saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin exemplify potential consequences of changing pH and temperature on chemicals dissolved in the sea. This reveals major implications not only for ecotoxicology, but also for chemical signals that mediate species interactions such as foraging, reproduction or predation in the ocean, with unexplored consequences for ecosystem stability and ecosystem services.","Roggatz, C.C.; Fletcher, N.; Benoit, D.M.; Algar, A.C.; Doroff, A.; Wright, B.; Wollenberg Valero, K.C.; Hardege, J.D.",WOS:000493735100016,"Hardege, Jörg, J.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41558-019-0589-3,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Saxidomus gigantea,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, recreational vessels are currently unaccounted for in vessel noise models using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Here we conduct a case study investigating noise contributions from vessels with and without AIS (non-AIS) in a shallow coastal area within the Inner Danish waters. By tracking vessels with theodolite and AIS, while recording ambient noise levels, we find that non-AIS vessels have a higher occurrence (83%) than AIS vessels, and that motorised recreational vessels can elevate third-octave band noise centred at 0.125, 2 and 16 kHz by 47–51 dB. Accordingly, these vessels dominated the soundscape in the study site due to their high numbers, high speeds and proximity to the coast. Furthermore, recreational vessels caused 49–85% of noise events potentially eliciting behavioural responses in harbour porpoises (AIS vessels caused 5–24%). We therefore conclude that AIS data would poorly predict vessel noise pollution and its impacts in this and other similar marine environments. We suggest to improve vessel noise models and impact assessments by requiring that faster and more powerful recreational vessels carry AIS-transmitters.","Hermannsen, L.; Mikkelsen, L.; Tougaard, J.; Beedholm, K.; Johnson, M.; Madsen, P.T.",WOS:000493048400030,"Beedholm, Kristian, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-51222-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Marine Mammal Res, Aarhus, Denmark.",Denmark,,BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; PORPOISE PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; FREQUENCY NOISE; COASTAL WATERS; RADIATED NOISE; SARASOTA BAY; SHIP NOISE; IMPACTS; UNDERWATER,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

To reduce costs, molecular methods have been proposed as alternatives to morphology-based monitoring. Metatranscriptomics can contribute to promote both cost-effectiveness and accuracy of biological assessments of aquatic ecosystems. Here, we describe and evaluate the construction of a metatranscriptome dataset from a pelagic crustacean zooplankton community. We sampled zooplankton in one marine station, named LW02, in the North Sea, in both winter and summer, and generated transcripts using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), a third-generation nanopore-based sequencing technology. ONT is, uniquely, capable of sequencing RNA directly, rather than depending on reverse transcription and PCR, and applicable to be used directly in the field. We found that metatranscriptomics is capable of species detection, including screening for the presence of endoparasites, hence competing with morphological identification. Taxonomic analysis based on ribosomal 18S transcripts identified calanoid copepods, particularly <i>Temora longicornis</i> and <i>Acartia clausi</i>, as the most abundant community members. Moreover, up to 40.4% and 50.5% of all sequences could be assigned to predicted genes in the winter and summer sample, respectively. The most abundant mRNA transcripts with known function coded for essential metabolic processes. GO term annotation revealed that genes involved in glycolytic and translation-related processes were most expressed in the community. Although small in scale, our study provides the basis for future efforts to characterize the metatranscriptome of marine zooplankton communities and its application in biomonitoring programs.","Semmouri, I.; De Schamphelaere, K.A.C.; Mees, J.; Janssen, C.R.; Asselman, J.",WOS:000508769700011,"Asselman, Jana, J.","Ghent University, Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Aquatic Ecology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104836,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",North Sea,Temora longicornis,,,Community transcriptomics; Metabarcoding; Copepods; MinIon,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Lab Environm Toxicol & Aquat Ecol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Community transcriptomics; Metabarcoding; North sea; Copepods; Temora longicornis; MinIon,NORTH-SEA; PLANKTON COMMUNITIES; BIODIVERSITY; DNA; TRANSCRIPTION; ANNOTATION; BLAST2GO; POSITION; ECOLOGY; DEFENSE,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Ghent University - Faculty of Bioscience Engineering - Department of Animal sciences and aquatic ecology - Environmental Toxicology Unit (GhEnToxLab),x,,,,

Tuna are characterized by dynamic distribution patterns that respond to climate variability and long‐term change. Here, we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on the worldwide distribution and relative abundance of six tuna species between 1958 and 2004 and estimated the expected end‐of‐the‐century changes based on a high‐greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). We created species distribution models using a long‐term Japanese longline fishery dataset and two‐step generalized additive models. Over the historical period, suitable habitats shifted poleward for 20 out of 22 tuna stocks, based on their gravity centre (GC) and/or one of their distribution limits. On average, tuna habitat distribution limits have shifted poleward 6.5 km per decade in the northern hemisphere and 5.5 km per decade in the southern hemisphere. Larger tuna distribution shifts and changes in abundance are expected in the future, especially by the end‐of‐the‐century (2080–2099). Temperate tunas (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, and southern bluefin) and the tropical bigeye tuna are expected to decline in the tropics and shift poleward. In contrast, skipjack and yellowfin tunas are projected to become more abundant in tropical areas as well as in most coastal countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ). These results provide global information on the potential effects of climate change in tuna populations and can assist countries seeking to minimize these effects via adaptive management.","Erauskin-Extramiana, M.; Arrizabalaga, H.; Hobday, A.J.; Cabré, A.; Ibaibarriaga, L.; Arregui, I.; Murua, H.; Chust, G.",WOS:000467441900015,"Erauskin-Extramiana, Maite, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.14630,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"AZTI, Marine Res Div, Sukarrieta, Basque Country, Spain.",Spain,climate change; exclusive economic zone; future projections; poleward shift; species distribution model; tuna,CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; PACIFIC-OCEAN; TOP PREDATORS; BLUEFIN TUNA; GLOBAL OCEAN; NORTH-SEA; FISHERIES; IMPACTS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Tecnalia - AZTI - Marine Research Division,x,,,,

However, a comprehensive regional and global network should be designed to be representative of all aspects of biodiversity, including populations, species, and biogenic habitats. A good exemplar would be the Coral Triangle (CT) because it is the most species rich area in the ocean but only 2% of its area is in any kind of MPA. Our analysis consisted of five different groups of layers of biodiversity features: biogenic habitat, species richness, species of special conservation concern, restricted range species, and areas of importance for sea turtles. We utilized the systematic conservation planning software <i>Zonation</i> as a decision-support tool to ensure representation of biodiversity features while balancing selection of protected areas based on the likelihood of threats. Our results indicated that the average representation of biodiversity features within the existing MPA system is currently about 5%. By systematically increasing MPA coverage to 10% of the total area of the CT, the average representation of biodiversity features within the MPA system would increase to over 37%. Marine areas in the Halmahera Sea, the outer island arc of the Banda Sea, the Sulu Archipelago, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Malaita Islands were identified as priority areas for the designation of new MPAs. Moreover, we recommended that several existing MPAs be expanded to cover additional biodiversity features within their adjacent areas, including MPAs in Indonesia (e.g., in the Birds Head of Papua), the Philippines (e.g., in the northwestern part of the Sibuyan Sea), Malaysia (e.g., in the northern part of Sabah), Papua New Guinea (e.g., in the Milne Bay Province), and the Solomon Islands (e.g., around Santa Isabel Island). An MPA system that covered 30% of the CT would include 65% of the biodiversity features. That just two-thirds of biodiversity was represented by one-third of the study area supports calls for at least 30% of the ocean to be in no-fishing MPA. This assessment provides a blueprint for efficient gains in marine conservation through the extension of the current MPA system in the CT region. Moreover, similar data could be compiled for other regions, and globally, to design ecologically representative MPAs.","Asaad, I.; Lundquist, C.J.; Erdmann, M.V.; van Hooidonk, R.; Costello, M.J.",,"Asaad, Irawan, I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2018.00400,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial research efforts are often required to estimate vital rates, with results of unknown applicability to other locations or larger areas within the species range. We investigated whether a rate variable, growth, can be estimated across the entire range of a species. We used data from the commercial range of the American lobster <i>Homarus americanus</i> to develop a model to calculate von Bertalanffy growth parameters at any location in that range. Fixing the maximum size parameter (<i>L</i><sub>∞</sub>) to a biologically reasonable value resulted in more realistic estimates of growth than estimating this parameter from data at any one location. The growth parameter <i>k</i> decreased with latitude at a rate of 0.51% per year per degree of latitude for males and 0.40% for females. The von Bertalanffy parameters apply to individual growth; the bias in using these parameters to estimate population growth was minor. The underlying mechanism for the latitude model was investigated by GIS mapping of candidate environmental factors: depth, temperature, and salinity. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the growth parameter <i>k</i> and temperature. Growth rates of American lobster can now be estimated on a site-specific basis without having to undertake resource-intensive tag-recapture field studies or adopting an estimate from a distant location. Similar approaches with other vital rates allow calculations at any spatial scale, from local scales to those of populations and ecosystems.","Raper, J.L.D.; Schneider, D.C.",WOS:000319680700017,"Schneider, David, D.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps10282,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Growth modeling · American lobster · von Bertalanffy · Tag-recapture ,Journal article,,,"Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",Canada,Growth modeling; American lobster; von Bertalanffy; Tag-recapture,MODEL; SIZE; AGE,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Memorial University of Newfoundland - Department of Biology,x,Canada,,University,Science

Species living in shallower waters (characterized by a narrower bathymetric range) had the most specialized diets. All species appeared to be mesopredators, feeding mainly on Crustacea, Actinopterygii, Mollusca and Polychaeta. Despite shared common morphological features, from the high ecological diversity of prey items, we hypothesized the presence of different predatory behavior among the species studied: some species were able to feed on endobenthic and/or epibenthic organisms, while others had made limited movements in the water column. Non-parametric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis highlighted the presence of five predator groups, confirming strong resource partitioning, as also demonstrated by low levels of interspecific niche overlap. The observed variations in feeding habits could be ascribed only to size and not to sex or season. Generally, diet changed from small Crustacean prey, to larger prey, like Actinopterygii and Mollusca. Some species became more generalist during development, others restricted their prey range. Shifts in feeding habits affected species’ roles in the food web, with different species occupying different functional trophic groups over the course of their life cycles.","Mulas, A.; Bellodi, A.; Cannas, R.; Carbonara, P.; Cau, A.; Marongiu, M.F.; Pesci, P.; Porcu, C.; Follesa, M.C.",WOS:000496464000001,"Mulas, Antonello, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00227-019-3607-0,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Consorzio Interuniv Sci Mare, CoNISMa, Piazzale Flaminio 9, I-00196 Rome, Italy.",Italy,,STINGRAY DASYATIS-PASTINACA; RAY RAJA-CLAVATA; COMPARATIVE FEEDING ECOLOGY; STANDARDIZED DIET COMPOSITIONS; SMALL-SPOTTED CATSHARK; THORNBACK RAY; COMMON STINGRAY; SCYLIORHINUS-CANICULA; STABLE-ISOTOPES; MIRALETUS CHONDRICHTHYES,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

At the same time, to date it remains poorly studied in many types of water bodies, for example, in highly mineralised rivers. In 2009–2017 a study of meiobenthos was conducted for the first time in the saline tributaries of the hypergalin Lake Elton, located in the protected area of the Eltonsky Nature Park (Volgograd Region, Russia). This current paper provides information on the overall taxonomic composition of the community in rivers, as well as an annotated checklist of identified species. The data on the structure and abundance of the species populations, their occurrence, ecology, global and local distribution are given in the checklist along with taxonomic and other comments. In total 73 taxa of 12 systematic groups of hydrobionts have been recorded. There are 38 representatives identified to species level. Among them, there are three species (nematodes Diplolaimelloides delyi, Ethmolaimus multipapillatus, and Monhystrella parvella) that had not been recorded previously from Russia and five species (nematodes Allodiplogaster media, Calodorylaimus salinus, Daptonema salinae, Mesodorylaimus rivalis, and Oncholaimus rivalis) which have been collected here for the first time and described as new to science. The presence of rare and new species shows a certain uniqueness of the ecosystems of the tributaries of Lake Elton and indicates the need for their further study and conservation.","Gusakov, V.A.",WOS:000463877100004,"Gusakov, Vladimir, V.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.24189/ncr.2019.004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"distribution, meiobenthos, population abundance, population structure, saline rivers, taxonomic composition",Journal article,,,"RAS, Papanin Inst Biol Inland Waters, Moscow, Russia.",Russia,distribution; meiobenthos; population abundance; population structure; saline rivers; taxonomic composition,APOCYCLOPS-DENGIZICUS LEPESCHKIN; BASIN VOLGOGRAD REGION; SALINE RIVERS; LAKE BASIN; WULP DIPTERA; NEMATODA; COPEPODA; CHIRONOMIDAE; REDESCRIPTION; GENUS,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,,,,,,

This paper examines how undiscovered Arctic oil and gas resources are distributed within the territories of the eight Arctic nations and within the territories claimed by these nations. Knowing how resources are distributed will help determine whether it is worth having disputes over the claimed territories as well as determining the importance of the U.S. ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).    This paper utilized geo-processing and areal estimation from United States Geological Survey (USGS), Arctic resource data, and territorial border data for probing the above issues. The analysis suggests that most of the resources are distributed within existing rather than claimed territories. The key conclusions are: (1) extended continental shelf claims should not be a major point of contention; (2) the U.S. and Russia are overwhelmingly the largest holders of undiscovered Arctic oil and gas; (3) the U.S. has little reason to ratify the UNCLOS for the purpose of securing energy resources; and (4) Greenland may be unexpectedly important in future Arctic discussions. These findings alter the geopolitics of undiscovered Arctic resources and shift the importance onto energy resources within existing territories.","Wong, E.",,"Wong, Ernest, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.13021/nvpp.v7i1.132,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tracking a small seabird: first records of foraging movements in the Sooty Tern <i>Onychoprion fuscatus</i>. <i>Mar. Ornithol. 43</i>: 235-239","Over the last 12 years, the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology to track the movements of seabirds has revealed important information on their behaviour and ecology that has greatly aided in their conservation. To date, the main limiting factor in the tracking of seabirds has been the size of loggers, restricting their use to medium-sized or larger seabird species only. This study reports on the GPS tracking of a small seabird, the Sooty Tern <i>Onychoprion fuscatus</i>, from the globally important population breeding on Dog Island, Anguilla. The eight Sooty Terns tracked in this preliminary study foraged a mean maximum distance of 94 (SE 12) km from the breeding colony, with a mean trip duration of 12 h 35 min, and mean travel speed of 14.8 (SE 1.2) km/h. While our study was limited in scope, it showed that small loggers such as the ones used present new opportunities for accurately tracking the short-term movements of small seabird species, thus providing huge potential to advance our understanding of seabird behaviour and conservation. Indeed, all study birds foraged in waters outside of Anguilla’s Exclusive Economic Zone near the neighbouring islands of Saint Martin, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Eustatius, and St Kitts and Nevis, with 50% of birds commuting along the same route, thus demonstrating that the conservation of this population, with further study, will have geopolitical complexities.","Soanes, L.M.; Bright, J.A.; Brodin, G.; Mukhida, F.; Green, J.A.",,"Green, Jonathan, J.A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"Anguilla, Caribbean, GPS tracking, Lesser Antilles, tropical seabird, Sooty Tern",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of open source software and data for establishment of GIS services throughout the network in a mapping organization at national or international level. PhD Thesis. Politecnico di Torino: Torino.  v, 166 pp.","Federal agencies and their partners collect and manage large amounts of geospatial data but it is often not easily found when needed, and sometimes data is collected or purchased multiple times. In short, the best government data is not always organized and managed efficiently to support decision making in a timely and cost effective manner.  National mapping agencies, various Departments responsible for collection of different types of Geospatial data and their authorities cannot, for very long, continue to operate, as they did a few years ago like people living in an island. Leaders need to look at what is now possible that was not possible before, considering capabilities such as cloud computing, crowd sourced data collection, available Open source remotely sensed data and multi source information vital in decision-making as well as new Web-accessible services that provide, sometimes at no cost. Many of these services previously could be obtained only from local GIS experts. These authorities need to consider the available solution and gather information about new capabilities, reconsider agency missions and goals, review and revise policies, make budget and human resource for decisions, and evaluate new products, cloud services, and cloud service providers.  To do so, we need, choosing the right tools to rich the above-mentioned goals. As we know, Data collection is the most cost effective part of the mapping and establishment of a Geographic Information system. However, it is not only because of the cost for the data collection task but also because of the damages caused by the delay and the time that takes to provide the user with proper information necessary for making decision from the field up to the user’s hand. In fact, the time consumption of a project for data collection, processing, and presentation of geospatial information has more effect on the cost of a bigger project such as disaster management, construction, city planning, environment, etc. Of course, with such a pre-assumption that we provide all the necessary information from the existing sources directed to user’s computer.  The best description for a good GIS project optimization or improvement is finding a methodology to reduce the time and cost, and increase data and service quality (meaning; Accuracy, updateness, completeness, consistency, suitability, information content, integrity, integration capability, and fitness for use as well as user’s specific needs and conditions that must be addressed with a special attention).  Every one of the above-mentioned issues must be addressed individually and at the same time, the whole solution must be provided in a global manner considering all the criteria.  In this thesis at first, we will discuss about the problem we are facing and what is needed to be done as establishment of National Spatial Data Infra-Structure (NSDI), the definition and related components. Then after, we will be looking for available Open Source Software solutions to cover the whole process to manage; Data collection, Data base management system, data processing and finally data services and presentation. The first distinction among Software is whether they are, Open source and free or commercial and proprietary. It is important to note that in order to make distinction among softwares it is necessary to define a clear specification for this categorization. It is somehow very difficult to distinguish what software belongs to which class from legal point of view and therefore, makes it necessary to clarify what is meant by various terms. With reference to this concept there are 2 global distinctions then, inside each group, we distinguish another classification regarding their functionalities and applications they are made for in GIScience.  According to the outcome of the second chapter, which is the technical process for selection of suitable and reliable software according to the characteristics of the users need and required components, we will come to next chapter. In chapter 3, we elaborate in to the details of the GeoNode software as our best candidate tools to take responsibilities of those issues stated before.  In Chapter 4, we will discuss the existing Open Source Data globally available with the predefined data quality criteria (Such as theme, data content, scale, licensing, and coverage) according to the metadata statement inside the datasets by mean of bibliographic review, technical documentation and web search engines. We will discuss in chapter 5 further data quality concepts and consequently define sets of protocol for evaluation of all datasets according to the tasks that a mapping organization in general, needed to be responsible to the probable users in different disciplines such as; Reconnaissance, City Planning, Topographic mapping, Transportation, Environment control, disaster management and etc…  In Chapter 6, all the data quality assessment and protocols will be implemented into the pre-filtered, proposed datasets. In the final scores and ranking result, each datasets will have a value corresponding to their quality according to the sets of rules that are defined in previous chapter.  In last steps, there will be a vector of weight that is derived from the questions that has to be answered by user with reference to the project in hand in order to finalize the most appropriate selection of Free and Open Source Data. This Data quality preference has to be defined by identifying a set of weight vector, and then they have to be applied to the quality matrix in order to get a final quality scores and ranking. At the end of this chapter there will be a section presenting data sets utilization in various projects such as “ Early Impact Analysis” as well as “Extreme Rainfall Detection System (ERDS)- version 2” performed by ITHACA.  Finally, in conclusion, the important criteria, as well as future trend in GIS software are discussed and at the end recommendations will be presented.","Jafari Salim, M.",,"Jafari Salim, Mehrdad, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shipping corridors as a framework for advancing marine law and policy in the Canadian Arctic. <i>Ocean and Coastal Law Jounal 22(1)</i>: 63-84","This article describes how a new policy – Arctic shipping corridors – can provide an adaptable framework for advancing marine law and policy in the Canadian Arctic. As the polar ice pack recedes due to climate change, vessel traffic in the region is increasing. As an initial response, the Canadian federal government has proposed a system of voluntary marine transportation corridors. Shipping corridors are a pragmatic policy solution that could be used to advance a number of priority maritime issues including: responsible economic development, human and vessel safety, environmental protection, and Inuit rights. Effective designation and management of shipping corridors requires a more integrated approach than exists now to account for the complexity of the Arctic marine environment. This paper explores how corridor design can create a national arctic shipping policy that advances (1) marine safety, (2) Inuit land claims agreements, (3) environmental protection, and (4) international cooperation.","Porta, L.; Abou-Abssi, E.; Dawson, J.; Mussells, O.",,"Porta, Louie, L.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"Arctic Corridors, Arctic Shipping, Northwest Passage, Marine Conservation, Marine Safety, Canada",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ocean wave energy is the least developed renewable energy source, despite having the highest energy per unit area. While many hurdles remain in developing wave energy, assessing potential conflicts and evaluating tradeoffs with the existing uses is essential. Marine planning encompasses a broad array of activities that take place in and affect large marine ecosystems, making it an ideal tool for evaluating wave energy resource use conflicts. In this study, we used a spatially explicit, open source decision support tool to evaluate wave energy facility development off the U.S. west coast. We then used this output to identify potential conflicts between wave energy facilities and the existing marine uses in the context of marine planning. We found that regions with the highest wave energy potential were distant from major cities and that infrastructure limitations (cable landing sites) restrict integration with the existing power grids. We also identified multiple potential conflicts, including commercial fishing, shipping and transportation, and marine conservation areas. While wave energy generation facilities may be economically viable, we must also incorporate costs associated with conflicts that arise with the existing marine uses.","Plummer, M.L.; Feist, B.E.",WOS:000386337200009,"Plummer, Mark, M.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/08920753.2016.1208877,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"conservation areas, economics, marine planning, renewable energy, resource conflicts, wave energy",Journal article,,,"NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",USA,conservation areas; economics; marine planning; renewable energy; resource conflicts; wave energy,WAVE ENERGY; OFFSHORE WIND; MANAGEMENT; COASTAL; UNCERTAINTY,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Despite the availability of fisheries statistics at the national level, reported catch amounts account only for a portion of total fisheries removals. This study aims to provide an estimate of 1) catches for all marine fishing sectors; 2) fishing effort in the major Italian fishing fleets; and 3) catch per unit of effort from 1950 to 2010. Catches were estimated using a catch-reconstruction approach that looked at all types of fisheries removals: from reported and unreported landings (from both industrial and artisanal fisheries) to recreational landings and discards. The reconstructed total catch for the 1950–2010 time period was 2.6 times the amount reported by the FAO on behalf of Italy. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) landings constituted 53.9% of the reconstructed total catch, followed by reported catches (38.8%) and unreported discards (7.3%). Industrial fisheries were dominant, with 79.1% of the reconstructed total removals, followed by the artisanal catch (16.8%), with recreational (3.2%) and subsistence (0.9%) fisheries making very small contributions. Catch per unit of effort declined since the early 1950s. Our study is the first that estimated total Italian fisheries removals and fishing capacity using a holistic approach; such approach is particularly important in areas like the Mediterranean Sea, where the multi-species and multi-gear nature of fisheries make the assessment of single-species fisheries resources and their management difficult.","Piroddi, C.; Gristina, M.; Zylich, K.; Greer, K.; Ulman, A.; Zeller, D.; Pauly, D.",WOS:000362138700017,"Zeller, Dirk, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2015.06.028,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Catches; Recreational; Unreported; Discards; Industrial; Artisanal,Journal article,,,"Spanish Res Council, Inst Marine Sci, Barcelona, Spain.",Spain,Catches; Recreational; Unreported; Discards; Industrial; Artisanal,CATCH COMPOSITION; ADRIATIC SEA; PACIFIC,Fisheries,Fisheries,,,,,,
