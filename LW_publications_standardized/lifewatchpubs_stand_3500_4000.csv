Congressional Research Service: Washington.  73 pp.","This report provides background information and issues for Congress on maritime territorial and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) disputes in the East China (ECS) and South China Sea (SCS) involving China, with a focus on how these disputes may affect U.S. strategic and policy interests. Other CRS reports focus on other aspects of these disputes. China's actions for asserting and defending its maritime territorial and EEZ claims in the ECS and SCS raise several potential policy and oversight issues for Congress. Decisions that Congress makes on these issues could substantially affect U.S. strategic, political, and economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere. This report uses the term China's near-seas region to mean the Yellow Sea, the ECS, and the SCS. This report uses the term EEZ dispute to refer to a dispute principally between China and the United States over whether coastal states have a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating in their EEZs. There are also other kinds of EEZ disputes, including disputes between neighboring countries regarding the extents of their adjacent EEZs.","O'Rourke, R.",,"O'Rourke, Ronald, R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A supply-side story of oil and gas: how fear of the future dictates behaviour today. PhD Thesis. London School of Economics and Political Science: London.  177 pp.","The aim of this dissertation is to determine the spatial and dynamic mechanisms that govern the supply of oil and natural gas. Specifically, the research evaluates how fear of the future affects behavior today and thereby it tests whether non-renewable resource owners behave in the forward-looking manner described by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s. Understanding what governs the supply of oil and natural gas is vital, as these fuels have significant economic and environmental implications for the planet. Integrating original research papers, the dissertation unfolds in seven chapters. The first and second chapters provide the foundation for the following research, by introducing the existing literature on oil and gas management. The subsequent three chapters discuss common pool problems as a method of identifying forward-looking behavior. Retaining this focus on weak property rights, chapter six evaluates the short-term relationship between government stability and oil extraction in authoritarian petro-states. The final chapter summarizes the main findings and outlines key implications. Drawing on new datasets and novel methodological tools, this dissertation demonstrates how fear of common pool problems governs exploration and extraction in the oil and gas industry today. However, contrary to conventional theory, this dissertation does not find that political instability motivates authoritarian regimes to accelerate their extraction.","Bligaard Nielsen, T.",,"Bligaard Nielsen, Thomas, T.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatially explicit conservation measures such as the creation of representative networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a critical step towards the conservation and management of marine ecosystems, as well as to improve public awareness. Conservation efforts in ecologically rich and threatened ecosystems are specially needed. This is particularly urgent for the Mediterranean marine biodiversity, which includes highly mobile marine vertebrates. Here, we studied the at sea distribution of one of the most endangered Mediterranean seabird, the critically endangered Balearic shearwater <em>Puffinus mauretanicus</em>. Present knowledge, from vessel-based surveys, suggests that this species has a coastal distribution over the productive Iberian shelf in relation to the distribution of their main prey, small pelagic fish. We used miniaturised satellite transmitters to determine the key marine areas of the southern population of Balearic shearwaters breeding on Eivissa and spot the spatial connections between breeding and key marine areas. Our tracking study indicates that Balearic shearwaters do not only forage along the Iberian continental shelf but also in more distant marine areas along the North African coast, in particular W of Algeria, but also NE coast of Morocco. Birds recurrently visit these shelf areas at the end of the breeding season. Species distribution modelling identified chlorophyll <em>a</em> as the most important environmental variable in defining those oceanographic features characterizing their key habitats in the western Mediterranean. We identified persistent oceanographic features across time series available in the study area and discuss our results within the current conservation scenario in relation to the ecology of the species.","Louzao, M.; Delord, K.; García, D.; Boué, A.; Weimerskirch, H.",WOS:000305336400006,"García, David, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0035728,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Ctr Natl Rech Sci UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France.",France,,ANCHOVY ENGRAULIS-ENCRASICOLUS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SEABIRD; FISHERIES; HABITAT; PHYTOPLANKTON; POPULATIONS; PERFORMANCE,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

Mismatches in scale between the occurrence of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, and the size and nature of the human footprint, and the different levels and scope of governance, are a significant challenge in conservation planning. These scale mismatches are further confounded by data resolution disparities across and amongst the different scales. To address this challenge, we developed a multi-resolution scale-linked marine spatial planning method. We tested this approach in the development of a Conservation Plan for a significant portion of South Africa’s exclusive economic zone, adjacent to the east coast province of KwaZulu-Natal (the SeaPlan project). The study’s dataset integrated the geographic distribution of 390 biodiversity elements (species, habitats, and oceanographic processes) and 38 human activities. A multi-resolution system of planning unit layers (PUL), with individual PUs ranging in resolution from 0.2 to 10 km, was designed to arrange and analyse these data. Spatial priorities for conservation were selected incrementally at different scales, contributing conservation targets from the fine-, medium- and large-scale analyses, and from the coast to the offshore. Compared to a basic single-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our multi-resolution scale-linked method selects 6% less conservation area to achieve the same targets. Compared to a multi-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our method requires only an additional 5% area. Overall, this method reflects the multi-scale nature of marine social-ecological systems more realistically, is relatively simple and replicable, and serves to better connect fine-scale and large-scale spatial management policies. We discuss the impacts of this study on protected area expansion planning processes in South Africa. This study showcases a methodological advance that has the potential to impact marine spatial planning practices and policies.","Lagabrielle, E.; Lombard, A.T.; Harris, J.M.; Livingstone, T.-C.",WOS:000437246700001,"Harris, Jean, J.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0192582,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ La Reunion, UMR ESPACE DEV 228, IRD, St Denis, La Reunion, France.",France,,ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; COMMERCIAL PRAWN TRAWLERS; PROTECTED AREAS; INCIDENTAL CAPTURE; SCALE MISMATCHES; SHARK NETS; COASTAL; IMPACT; MODEL; CHALLENGES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

The continental waters of North America contain remarkable biodiversity, but many species face increasing pressure from overexploitation, climate change, and other anthropogenic impacts. Canada, Mexico, and the USA have pledged to protect at least 10% of their marine and coastal waters by 2020 as signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and have made efforts to establish MPAs. These MPAs vary widely in terms of levels of protection and designation processes; information that is not reflected in official statistics. To this end, we critically examined progress toward the CBD target for marine protection in continental North American waters to determine how well ocean ecosystems are protected by MPAs. We reviewed government data to determine whether MPAs met four criteria: legal designation, permanence, presence of an administrative structure, and a completed management plan. Sites that met all four criteria were categorized as “implemented.” Any sites that failed to meet one or more criterion were considered “incompletely implemented” and excluded from the analysis. We also calculated the amount of “fully-protected” MPAs in which all extractive uses are prohibited. We found that <1% of North America's continental ocean is protected, and only 0.04% is fully-protected. Canada has the least area protected with just 0.11% in implemented MPAs, and 0.01% in fully-protected MPAs. Mexico and the USA have 1.62 and 1.29% in implemented MPAs, and 0.11 and 0.03% in fully-protected MPAs, respectively. Results show that many North American MPAs are incompletely implemented and therefore currently fail to provide adequate protection. The inclusion of such sites in official government statistics can inflate the perception of how much, and how well, the ocean is protected. We outline some of the major challenges to MPA establishment in each country and offer recommendations to increase the number and effectiveness of MPAs in North America.","Jessen, S.; Morgan, L.E.; Bezaury-Creel, J.E.; Barron, A.; Govender, R.; Pike, E.P.; Saccomanno, V.R.; Moffitt, R.A.",WOS:000457690600277,"Jessen, Sabine, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3389/fmars.2017.00279,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Canadian Pk & Wilderness Soc, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",Canada,marine protected areas; MPAs; aichi target 11; North America; Canada; Mexico; USA,MARINE RESERVES; AREAS; NETWORK; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; LESSONS; IMPLEMENTATION; VULNERABILITY; INSIGHTS,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

This region also exhibits the highest global rates of mangrove loss. Remotely sensed data provides timely and accurate information on mangrove distribution and dynamics critical for targeting loss hotspots and guiding intervention. This report inventories, describes and compares all known single- and multi-date remotely sensed datasets with regional coverage and provides areal mangrove extents by country. Multi-date datasets were used to estimate dynamics and identify loss hotspots (i.e., countries that exhibit greatest proportional loss). Results indicate Myanmar is the primary mangrove loss hotspot, exhibiting 35% loss from 1975–2005 and 28% between 2000–2014. Rates of loss in Myanmar were four times the global average from 2000–2012.

We outline a method to construct country-level wind resource supply curves, delineated by resource quality and other parameters. Using mesoscale reanalysis data, we generate estimates for wind quality, both terrestrial and offshore, across the globe. Because not all land or water area is suitable for development, appropriate database layers provide exclusions to reduce the total resource to its technical potential. We expand upon estimates from related studies by: using a globally consistent data source of uniquely detailed wind speed characterizations; assuming a non-constant coefficient of performance for adjusting power curves for altitude; categorizing the distance from resource sites to the electric power grid; and characterizing offshore exclusions on the basis of sea ice concentrations. The product, then, is technical potential by country, classified by resource quality as determined by net capacity factor. Additional classifications dimensions are available, including distance to transmission networks for terrestrial wind and distance to shore and water depth for offshore. We estimate the total global wind generation potential of 560 PWh for terrestrial wind with 90% of resource classified as low-to-mid quality, and 315 PWh for offshore wind with 67% classified as mid-to-high quality. These estimates are based on 3.5 MW composite wind turbines with 90 m hub heights, 0.95 availability, 90% array efficiency, and 5 MW/km<sup>2</sup> deployment density in non-excluded areas.

Further reductions are expected as the industry matures. For most African coastal states, specific information about their offshore wind potential is not available. This study aims to address this shortcoming by evaluating the technical offshore wind potential of the entire continent using spatially explicit models and long-term satellite data. Two different scenarios were developed to reflect different levels of technological maturity in the wind industry: The shallow-water, near-coast scenario 1 represented the conservative assumption that technology will not improve beyond what is available already now. The deep-water, full-exclusive economic zone (EEZ) scenario 2 assumes the operational availability of floating platforms that would allow it to access wind resources at much deeper water depths across the entire EEZ. It is emphasized that the model results are subject to a number of uncertainties and therefore should be treated as first order estimates only. Both scenarios indicate very good technical offshore wind energy potential for one third of the African coastal states, with Mozambique, South Africa, Somalia, Madagascar and Morocco exhibiting particularly good resources. More than 90% of the offshore wind resources are concentrated in coastal zones associated to three African Power Pools. These are the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), the Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP), and the Comité Maghrébin de l′Electricité (COMELEC). A joint and integrated development within these power pools could offer a promising approach to utilising offshore wind energy in Africa.","Elsner, P.",WOS:000458294500029,"Elsner, Paul, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.034,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Offshore wind energy; Resource potential analysis; Africa; Energy and development; Energy poverty,Journal article,,,"Birkbeck Univ London, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",England,Offshore wind energy; Resource potential analysis; Africa; Energy and development; Energy poverty,POWER; MODEL,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,

We find that long-term combined potentials range between 730 and 3700 EJ/a worldwide, depending crucially on the acceptable share of land—up to 3.5% of total (non-ice covered) land on earth. Realistic potentials account for limitations such as land-use competition and acceptance, together with resource quality and remoteness as proxies for cost.

LRPs can support consistent management evaluation among species and regions, and can advance ecosystem-based fisheries management. For transboundary species, LRPs prorated by local abundance can inform local management decisions when international coordination is lacking. We estimated LRPs for western Pacific leatherbacks in the U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (WCEEZ) using three approaches with different types of information on local abundance. For the current application, the best-informed LRP used a local abundance estimate derived from nest counts, vital rate information, satellite tag data, and fishery observer data, and was calculated with a Potential Biological Removal estimator. Management strategy evaluation was used to set tuning parameters of the LRP estimators to satisfy risk tolerances for falling below population thresholds, and to evaluate sensitivity of population outcomes to bias in key inputs. We estimated local LRPs consistent with three hypothetical management objectives: allowing the population to rebuild to its maximum net productivity level (4.7 turtles per five years), limiting delay of population rebuilding (0.8 turtles per five years), or only preventing further decline (7.7 turtles per five years). These LRPs pertain to all human-caused removals and represent the WCEEZ contribution to meeting population management objectives within a broader international cooperative framework. We present multi-year estimates, because at low LRP values, annual assessments are prone to substantial error that can lead to volatile and costly management without providing further conservation benefit. The novel approach and the performance criteria used here are not a direct expression of the “jeopardy” standard of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but they provide useful assessment information and could help guide international management frameworks. Given the range of abundance data scenarios addressed, LRPs should be estimable for many other areas, populations, and taxa.","Curtis, K.A.; Moore, J.E.; Benson, S.R.",WOS:000361601100017,"Curtis, K.

Marine traffic and potential impacts towards cetaceans within the Madeira EEZ. <i>J. Cetacean Res. Manage. 16</i>: 17-28","Human population growth has resulted in an increase of marine traffic. This has been associated with wildlife disturbance and the effects are expected to increase with continued traffic expansion. A particularly impacted group is cetaceans, known to play an important role in the sustainability and regulation of marine ecosystems. An assessment of marine traffic can therefore contribute towards wildlife conservation measures, especially when evaluated in the context of important areas for cetaceans. The present study took place in Madeira’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), an area hosting a high diversity of cetacean species as well as island-associated groups. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data were collected from a land station between 2008 and 2011 and marine traffic and cetacean visual data collected during shipboard surveys between 2001 and 2011. Results show that Madeira’s offshore traffic (up to 12 n.miles from the shore) corresponds to approximately 12% and 22% of the traffic observed in the Baltic and North Sea, respectively. It is mostly composed of cargo ships navigating over fixed routes and using the area as a passage towards different destinations. Cruise ships intersect the area mainly to reach Funchal’s port. The number of recreational boats in the area was found to be underestimated since many of them are not equipped with AIS devices. The level of Madeira inshore traffic is harder to evaluate since it is a small area encompassing a shipping route, yet it may represent 0.8% of the traffic recorded in the Strait of Gibraltar. According to the inshore shipboard survey data, coastal marine traffic is mainly composed of fishing boats (47%), recreational boats (24%), ships (17%), whalewatching boats (10%) and big game fishing boats (2%). Most inshore and offshore vessels were found to be navigating at over 10 knots. An inshore ‘higher use corridor’ common to both vessels and cetaceans was identified as a potential danger zone.","Cunha, I.; Freitas, L.; Alves, F.; Dinis, A.; Ribeiro, C.; Nicolau, C.; Ferreira, R.; Goncalves, J.A.; Formigo, N.",,"Cunha, Inês, I.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,ATLANTIC OCEAN; SUSTAINABILITY; SURVEY – VESSEL; DISTRIBUTION; NORTHERN HEMISPHERE; FIN WHALE; SHORT-FINNED PILOT WHALE; BEAKED WHALES; SPERM WHALE; BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN; ATLANTIC SPOTTED DOLPHIN; COMMON DOLPHIN,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better represent the costs and other implications of such a transition, it is important that ESMs can realistically characterise the technical and economic potential of renewable energy resources. This paper presents a Geospatial Information System methodology for estimating the global offshore wind energy potential, i.e. the terawatt hour per year (TWh/yr) production potential of wind farms, assuming capacity could be built across the viable offshore area of each country. A bottom-up approach characterises the capacity factors of offshore wind farms by estimating the available wind power from high resolution global wind speed data sets. Temporal phenomena are retained by binning hourly wind speeds into 32 time slices per year considering the wind resource across several decades. For 157 countries with a viable offshore wind potential, electricity generation potential is produced in tranches according to the distance to grid connection, water depth and average annual capacity factor. These data can be used as inputs to ESMs and to assess the economically viable offshore wind energy potential, on a global or per-country basis.","Bosch, J.; Staffell, I.; Hawkes, A.D.",WOS:000448097800055,"Bosch, Jonathan, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.153,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Offshore wind energy; Wind energy potentials; GIS; Intermittency; Energy systems models; Renewables modelling,Journal article,,,"Grantham Inst, Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, England.",England,Offshore wind energy; Wind energy potentials; GIS; Intermittency; Energy systems models; Renewables modelling,RENEWABLE ENERGY; SYSTEM,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,

Active submarine vent fields are now known along the boundaries of 46 out of 52 recognized tectonic plates. Hydrothermal survey efforts over the most recent decade were sparked by national and commercial interests in the mineral resource potential of seafloor hydrothermal deposits, as well as by academic research. Here we incorporate recent data for back-arc spreading centers and ultraslow- and slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges (MORs) to revise a linear equation relating the frequency of vent fields along oceanic spreading ridges to spreading rate. We apply this equation globally to predict a total number of vent fields on spreading ridges, which suggests that ~900 vent fields remain to be discovered. Almost half of these undiscovered vent fields (comparable to the total of all vent fields discovered during 35 years of research) are likely to occur at MORs with full spreading rates less than 60 mm/yr. We then apply the equation regionally to predict where these hydrothermal vents may be discovered with respect to plate boundaries and national jurisdiction, with the majority expected to occur outside of states' exclusive economic zones. We hope that these predictions will prove useful to the community in the future, in helping to shape continuing ridge-crest exploration.","Beaulieu, S.E.; Baker, E.T.; German, C.R.",WOS:000365379500019,"Baker, Edward, E.T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2015.05.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Hydrothermal springs; Hydrothermal activity; Mid-ocean ridges; Spreading centers; Plate boundaries,Journal article,,,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",USA,Hydrothermal springs; Hydrothermal activity; Mid-ocean ridges; Spreading centers; Plate boundaries,MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; MASSIVE SULFIDES; CARLSBERG RIDGE; FIELD; DISCOVERY; PLUME; GAKKEL,Oceanography,Oceanography,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI),x,USA,,Research institute,Science

Average, global PIC standing stock in the top 100 m is estimated to be 27.04 ± 4.33 Tg PIC, with turnover times of ~7 days, which suggests PIC is likely removed by active processes such as grazing or rapid sinking, mediated through biogenic packaging (i.e., fecal pellets).

A global grid-cell methodology was adopted to assess the available global solar energy potential taking into account four constraints: land-use, solar irradiation, solar-to-electric technology, and net energy. Net energy is the amount of energy that is delivered to end-users, after subtraction of the energy inputs needed for capital infrastructure and operation. Both photovoltaic and concentrated solar power technologies are considered. The resulting constrained solar potential worldwide was estimated at 1098 exajoules per year, of which 98%, 75%, and only 15% can be extracted if the system needs to deliver an energy return on energy invested set at 5, 7.5, and 9, respectively. The resulting global solar potential is substantially lower than most previous estimates. Depending on how high the energy return needs to be relative to the energy investment needed to maintain a sustainable society, the achievable potential will be significantly constrained.

A terminal clade groups the peristerniine genera <em>Peristernia</em> and <em>Fusolatirus</em>, fasciolariines and the remaining peristerniines. Although none of these clades correspond to currently accepted taxonomic groups, the latter two clades are corroborated in the most recent multilocus molecular phylogeny.

Over the past decade, this goal has driven the establishment of many large marine protected areas (MPAs), several of which surround overseas island territories with current or historical military involvement, ranging from World War 2 battle sites to testing areas for the “ABCs” of atomic, biological, and chemical weapons during the cold war. For countries with significant overseas territories, such as the USA, France, and the UK, these remote possessions provide an opportunity to achieve biodiversity conservation objectives over large spatial scales. They also provide a strategic footprint for regional maritime spheres of influence, as well as possible future energy and mineral resources.

In this study, the annual gametogenesis and early larval development of <i>O. circumpicta</i> was examined, using histology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Histology indicated that the females and males initiated gonial mitosis in September, shortly after sexual resting in August. In December, ripe eggs first appeared in the follicles, and most of the females exhibited fully mature oocytes in May, as the water temperature reached 17 to 18°C. Spawning females were dominant in June and July, when the trochophore and strait-hinged veliger larvae were also identified in the branchial chambers, their size ranging from 111 to 130 μm and 135–205 μm in diameter, respectively. The veliger larvae in the brooding chamber exhibited a well developed velum and digestive tract, suggesting that the larvae are engaged in feeding in the branchial chamber. Unlike other marine bivalves in temperate coastal ecosystems, <i>O. circumpicta</i> has a long period of gonad maturation and a short resting phase. It has been believed that such a long period of reproductive maturation is associated with a low level of food in the environment and the comparatively large size of the oocytes, which may require a relatively longer time to accumulate necessary nutrients to produce large eggs in a food-poor environment.","Lim, N.-L.; Lee, H.-M.; Jeung, H.-D.; Noseworthy, R.G.; Jung, S.; Choi, K.-S.",WOS:000489603600001,"Lim, Na-Lae, N.-L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.6620/ZS.2019.58-29,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Ostrea circumpicta, LarvOstrea circumpicta, Larval development, Gametogenesis, Microscopy, Jeju Island Koreaal development, Gametogenesis, Microscopy, Jeju Island Korea",Journal article,,,"Jeju Natl Univ, Marine Sci Inst, Jeju, Jeju Self Gover, South Korea.",South Korea,Ostrea circumpicta; Larval development; Gametogenesis; Microscopy; Jeju Island Korea,ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; CLAM RUDITAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; SACCOSTREA-KEGAKI TORIGOE; CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS; PACIFIC OYSTER; WEST-COAST; 1ST REPORT; BIVALVIA; FLAT; BAY,Zoology,Zoology,,,,,,

Our new record closes a distribution gap of <i>P. maenadis</i> between previous southern observations in Portugal and France and northern occurrences in Denmark and Sweden. The additional literature survey suggests that <i>P. maenadis</i> is not very common and only occurs at scattered localities with prevalence of infestations usually well below 10% in host crab populations. However, the 45% prevalence observed in our study in November 2018 in the southern Wadden Sea indicates that also higher prevalences can occur. As the adult parasites feed on their host’s hemolymph they are likely to have consequences for the host’s energy budgets. In addition, infestations lead to morphological changes in the form of feminisation of male crabs (i.e. broader pleon, slender claws, bulging carapace) which we observed in several individuals. With this new record and literature review, we hope to spark future research into the distribution of this intriguing parasite species as well as on the impacts of infestations on shore crab hosts.","Cornelius, A.; Waser, A.M.; Buschbaum, C.; Thieltges, D.W.",WOS:000501242900032,"Buschbaum, Christian, C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12526-019-01012-3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biogeography; <i>Carcinus maenas</i>; Parasitism ,Journal article,,,"Univ Utrecht, Den Burg, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Biogeography; Carcinus maenas; Parasitism,CARCINUS-MAENAS; PARASITES,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Most examined plots belong to young forests; in particular, three age classes were considered (class 1, <22 years; class 3, 38–56 years; class 5, >77 years). Twenty-seven species and 2433 individuals were recorded. Box plots showed that forest age did not seem to be a key factor for land snail species richness and abundance at least in the time range of examined forests. However, this may not be true, if real old-growth forests are considered. No differences between evergreen and deciduous forest were found too. With regard to species composition, Non-metric multidimensional scaling demonstrated an assemblage of species widespread in all forest age classes, while Indicator Species Analysis failed to identify any species as indicator for any age category. This shows that a process is underway but has had insufficient time to differentiate assemblages and to accumulate the majority of rare species, due to the young nature of examined forests. Habitat structure may affect communities more than forest age: suitable microhabitats (a few old/very old trees for shelter) are a sufficient prerequisite for land snail diversity, ensuring community survival and protection, irrespective of forest age class. These findings highlight the importance of habitat structural complexity at local scale for preserving invertebrate diversity in Mediterranean secondary forests.","Barbato, D.; Benocci, A.; Manganelli, G.",WOS:000501406000018,"Barbato, Debora, D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117693,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Molluscs; Soil fauna; Forest age; Mediterranean; Microhabitat,Journal article,,,"Dipartimento Sci Fis Terra & Ambiente, Via Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",Italy,Molluscs; Soil fauna; Forest age; Mediterranean; Microhabitat,PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOLOGICAL DATA; PATTERNS; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; SCALE; RAREFACTION; SUCCESSION; VEGETATION; IMPACT,Forestry,Forestry,,,,,,

The Indonesian archipelago sits at the center of the Coral Triangle, extending over several biogeographic regions with unique benthic communities, where the extent of non-native species presence is largely unknown. It is also at the center of maritime traffic between Australasia and Asia, and therefore at risk of introduction of species that are carried on the hulls and ballast water of vessels. In the present study, we aimed to raise awareness on marine biological invasions across the Indonesian archipelago by fostering discussions among scientists, educating science students, generating media articles for the public and actively involving island communities. We also aimed to test the suitability of a range of methods commonly used in bioinvasion research (settlement arrays, DNA barcoding and environmental DNA metabarcoding, vessel surveys) to establish a baseline for biofouling species and potential threats, while developing much needed capacity for monitoring and application to other areas. We recorded 66 different non-coral specimens in the fouling communities of a remote group of islands of the Indonesian archipelago, represented mainly by the taxa Porifera, Tunicata and Mollusca, which are known to include notorious invasive species. None of the identified species was known to be invasive in the region but several were cryptogenic and/or were considered to have a very broad global distribution range that can potentially include part, or all, of the Indonesian archipelago. One species, the ascidian <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Didemnum molle</em>, was found to quickly settle and spread on available blank substrates. While settlement plates (monitored every 5 months) proved suitable for early detection of potential incursions of these organisms, benthic surveys, DNA barcoding and eDNA metabarcoding provide valuable complementary baseline biodiversity information. A combination of sampling methods is therefore recommended for similar studies in understudied high biodiversity areas. Results from vessel surveys highlights the importance of civil society education in helping prevent bioinvasions. This study represents the first marine biological invasions baseline, awareness and capacity development training carried in the Indonesian archipelago. The lessons taken from the variety of methods explored in a simultaneously scientific and educational setting should prove useful and motivate similar work in other areas of the world.","Huhn, M.; Madduppa, H.H.; Khair, M.; Sabrian, A.; Irawati, Y.; Anggraini, N.P.; Wilkinson, S.P.; Simpson, T.; Iwasaki, K.; Setiamarga, D.H.E.; Dias, P.J.",WOS:000496257300003,"Khair, Miftahul, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10530-019-02126-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Marine education; Early warning; Invasive; Southeast Asia; Indonesia ,Journal article,,,"NOAA, NRC Res Associate, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",USA,Marine education; Early warning; Invasive; Southeast Asia; Indonesia,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DIVERSITY; COLONIZATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; THREAT; ISLAND; OCEAN; PESTS; RISK,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

In Vietnam, many karst habitats are threatened, while their rich biodiversity is still far from being thoroughly explored. Given that conservation of karst biota strongly relies on correct species identification, the presence of undetected cryptic species can pose severe problems. The present study focuses on cryptic diversity among karst-inhabiting land snails of the genus <em>Cyclophorus</em> in northern Vietnam, where specimens with a similar shell morphology have been reported from various regions. In order to examine the diversity and evolutionary history of this “widespread morphotype”, we generated a Bayesian phylogeny based on DNA sequence data. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson tree processes model (bPTP) contributed to species delimitation and analyses of shell shape and size aided the morphological characterisation of individual species. We found that the examined specimens of the widespread morphotype did not form a single monophyletic group in the phylogeny but clustered into several different clades. We delimited nine different species that develop the widespread morphotype and described four of them as new. Processes of convergent evolution were probably involved in the origin of the delimited species, while their generally allopatric distribution could result from interspecific competition. Our findings indicate ongoing processes of speciation and a potential case of morphological character displacement. The high degree of morphological overlap found among the species underlines the importance of DNA sequence data for species delimitation and description in the genus <em>Cyclophorus</em>. Given the findings of the present study and the high potential that as yet undiscovered cryptic taxa have also evolved in other groups of karst-inhabiting organisms, we argue for a systematic and efficient detection and description of Vietnam’s karst biodiversity to provide a solid basis for future conservation planning.","von Oheimb, K.C.M.; von Oheimb, P.V.; Hirano, T.; Do, T.V.; Ablett, J.; Luong, H.V.; Pham, S.V.; Naggs, F.",WOS:000532599700008,"von Oheimb, Katharina, K.C.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0222163,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Berlin, Germany.",Germany,,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; DNA; CONSERVATION; GENUS; MITOCHONDRIAL; DELIMITATION; COMMUNITIES; SPECIATION; GASTROPOD,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Museum of Natural Science - Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science (MfN),x,,,,

They display a huge diversity, which makes them excellent ecological indicators of aquatic ecosystems. Usually, diatoms are identified using characteristics of their exoskeleton morphology. DNA-barcoding is an alternative to this and the use of High-Throughput-Sequencing enables the rapid analysis of many environmental samples at a lower cost than analyses under microscope. However, to identify environmental sequences correctly, an expertly curated reference library is needed. Several curated libraries for protists exists; none, however are dedicated to diatoms. Diat.barcode is an open-access library dedicated to diatoms which has been maintained since 2012. Data come from two sources (1) the NCBI nucleotide database and (2) unpublished sequencing data of culture collections. Since 2017, several experts have collaborated to curate this library for rbcL, a chloroplast marker suitable for species-level identification of diatoms. For the latest version of the database (version 7), 605 of the 3482 taxonomical names originally assigned by the authors of the rbcL sequences were modified after curation.

Some important free-living marine and estuarine species overwinter or oversummer by arrested embryogenesis in dormancy. The present contribution discusses the complex mechanisms behind embryonic dormancy by compiling knowledge from the 42 calanoid copepods from the superfamily Centropagoidea with well-described embryonic dormancy, which has been of scientific interest for decades. However, the determination of categories of copepod resting eggs—that is, diapause and quiescence, transitions between categories, the mechanisms controlling arrested development by the embryos, and how they interact with their surroundings—is not fully understood. Moreover, a clear link between the presence of the free-swimming population and their resting eggs in sediments is still not convincingly demonstrated. Here I evaluate the relative significance of potential cues driving the production of and the phase shift between egg categories. Understanding the initiation and termination of embryonic dormancy is of great importance for fundamental science—that is, population and food web ecology as well as climate science, aquaculture live feed, and ballast water research. Molecular techniques are developing rapidly, especially within health sciences, thus providing relevant tools applicable for plankton research. Here I suggest that applying molecular methods in addition to traditional physiological approaches in future research will lead to greater understanding of copepod embryonic dormancy, one of nature’s wonders.","Winding Hansen, B.",WOS:000497772200006,"Winding Hansen, Benni, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1086/705546,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Roskilde Univ, Dept Sci & Environm, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",Denmark,,ACARTIA-TONSA DANA; TROPICAL CALANOID COPEPOD; CENTROPAGES-HAMATUS COPEPODA; LABIDOCERA-AESTIVA COPEPODA; ZOOPLANKTON RESTING EGGS; ADULT STOCKING DENSITY; DELAYED-HATCHING EGGS; BAHIA BLANCA ESTUARY; SEA-BOTTOM MUDS; DIAPAUSE EGGS,Biology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Roskilde University - Department of Science and Environment,x,Denmark,,University,Science

In the last forty years, there have been recorded increases in mercury concentrations in biota that have spurred a growing number of research activities to assess the impact of mercury pollution on human health and environment. Field investigations that quantify mercury concentrations in marine biota have led to a large amount of experimental data scattered in many peer-reviewed publications making it difficult for modelling applications and regional environmental assessments. This paper reviews existing peer-reviewed literature and datasets on mercury concentration in marine flora and fauna (Animal, Plants and Chromista Kingdoms) in the Mediterranean basin. A total of 24,465 records have been retrieved from 539 sources and included in Mercury in Mediterranean Biota (M2B).

Gastropods play an important role in coastal ecosystems. In Watukarung, the local people collect marine organisms, including gastropods during low tide to supplement their income. Baseline information on the presence and abundance of gastropods in Watukarung are not available. Our survey collected 173 individuals of gastropod in the intertidal area of Watukarung that represent 8 families, 9 genera, and 13 species. Gastropod diversity index (H') in the three beaches (Ngalorombo, Pasir Putih, and Kasap) show varying values from the categories of low and medium species diversity. Although the data suggest that there should be a dominant species in the ecosystem (E < 0.5), there are no strong dominance species in the community (C < 0.5). Watukarung coastal waters are still in good condition for marine organisms with salinity > 31‰, DO > 8.1 mg/L, and pH > 8. The substrate is dominated by coarse sand. The total organic matter is relatively low (< 2.6%) due to characteristics of the substrate that is dominated by a rocky and sandy substrate. Based on the results, we suggest that Kasap beach can be established as a core zone considering its high diversity and density of gastropods as well as being distant from any residential area, whereas Ngalorombo and Pasir Putih beaches are suitable as usage zones for surfing tourism. We highlight the need for the local community, government, and private sector need to work together to encourage sustainably tourism while reducing environmental impacts in Watukarung.","Setyono, D.W.D.; Kusuma, H.A.; Poeteri, N.A.; Bengen, D.G.; Kurniawan, F.",,"Setyono, Dwi Eny Djoko, D.W.D.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.14203/mri.v44i1.529,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Indonesia,Gastropoda,Diversity index,,"Gastropod, intertidal zone, Watukarung",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS markers as well as morphological comparisons were performed to clarify their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic positions.

These results indicate that <em>F. fungites</em> as presently recognized is actually a species complex including at least two species. After checking type specimens, we conclude that specimens in clade A represent true <em>F. fungites</em> with two morphs (unattached and attached) and that all of those in clade B represent an unknown species and genus comprising an unattached morph with only one exception.

SeviL forms a noncovalent dimer that binds strongly to ganglio‐series GM1b oligosaccharide (Neu5Acɑ2‐3Galβ1‐3GalNAcβ1‐4Galβ1‐4Glc) and its precursor, asialo‐GM1 (Galβ1‐3GalNAcβ1‐4Galβ1‐4Glc). SeviL also interacts weakly with the glycan moiety of SSEA‐4 hexaose (Neu5Acα2‐3Galβ1‐3GalNAcβ1‐3Galα1‐4Galβ1‐4Glc). A partial protein sequence of the lectin was determined by mass spectrometry, and the complete sequence was identified from transcriptomic analysis. SeviL, consisting of 129 amino acids, was classified as an R(icin B)‐type lectin, based on the presence of the QxW motif characteristic of this fold. SeviL mRNA is highly expressed in gills and, in particular, mantle rim tissues. Orthologues sequences were identified in other species of the family Mytilidae, including <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>, from which lectin MytiLec‐1 was isolated and characterized in our previous studies. Thus, mytilid species contain lectins belonging to at least two distinct families (R‐type lectins and mytilectins) that have a common β‐trefoil fold structure but differing glycan‐binding specificities. SeviL displayed notable cytotoxic (apoptotic) effects against various cultured cell lines (human breast, ovarian, and colonic cancer; dog kidney) that possess asialo‐GM1 oligosaccharide at the cell surface. This cytotoxic effect was inhibited by the presence of anti‐asialo‐GM1 oligosaccharide antibodies. With HeLa ovarian cancer cells, SeviL showed dose‐ and time‐dependent activation of kinase MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, and caspase‐3/9. The transduction pathways activated by SeviL via the glycosphingolipid oligosaccharide were triggered apoptosis.","Fujii, Y.; Gerdol, M.; Kawsar, S.M.A.; Hasan, I.; Spazzali, F.; Yoshida, T.; Ogawa, Y.; Rajia, S.; Kamata, K.; Koide, Y.; Sugawara, S.; Hosono, M.; Tame, J.R.H.; Fujita, H.; Pallavicini, A.; Ozeki, Y.",WOS:000504043900001,"Pallavicini, Alberto, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/febs.15154,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Yokohama City Univ, Sch Sci, Kanazawa Ku, 22-2 Seto, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360027, Japan.",Japan,bivalves; ganglioside; Mytilisepta virgata; purplish bifurcate mussels; R-type lectin,AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; CRENOMYTILUS-GRAYANUS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MOLECULAR-BASIS; SEA; PROTEINS; BIVALVE; EGGS; GLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS; IDENTIFICATION,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,,,,,,

Trait-based approaches may provide such understanding, because it is the traits and adaptations of species that determine which environments they can inhabit. It is therefore important to identify key traits that determine species distributions and investigate how these traits relate to the environment. Based on scientific bottom-trawl surveys of marine fish abundances and traits of >1,200 species, we investigate trait-environment relationships and project the trait composition of marine fish communities across the continental shelf seas of the Northern hemisphere. We show that traits related to growth, maturation and lifespan respond most strongly to the environment. This is reflected by a pronounced “fast-slow continuum” of fish life-histories, revealing that traits vary with temperature at large spatial scales, but also with depth and seasonality at more local scales. Our findings provide insight into the structure of marine fish communities and suggest that global warming will favour an expansion of fast-living species. Knowledge of the global and local drivers of trait distributions can thus be used to predict future responses of fish communities to environmental change.","Beukhof, E.; Frelat, R.; Pecuchet, L.; Maureaud, A.; Spaanheden Dencker, T.; Solmundsson, J.; Punzón, A.; Primicerio, R.; Hidalgo, M.; Möllmann, C.; Lindegren, M.",WOS:000499827300001,"Beukhof, Esther, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-53998-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Ctr Ocean Life, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark.",Denmark,,LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; SIZE; RESPONSES; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; 4TH-CORNER; INDICATORS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

Along with noncommercial species, bycatch also includes commercial species that are below minimum legal size (MLS) or less profitable fishes owing to market conditions. Advanced technologies in fishing methods and fleet infrastructure are being introduced and practiced. Such developments have ensued in heavy exploitation of juveniles of commercially important fishes. Mangaluru fisheries harbour witnessed an average 168 thousand tonnes (t) of trawl landings/year in 2012-14, of which 133 thousand t (79 %) was retained for edible purpose and 0.35 thousand t (21 %) was marked as “low value bycatch” (LVB) which mainly transported as raw material for fish meal production. To assess the sustainability of marine fisheries production, it is important to understand the species composition and the juvenile composition of the fishes in LVB. A total of 121 species of finfishes were recorded from LVB of multiday trawlers (MDT). Among that, commercially important juveniles formed 47.5 % of the finfish LVB by weight (56.1 % by number). An estimated 4,693.4 t (272.4 million by numbers) of <i>Decapterus russelli</i> juveniles, 1,395.7 t (144.9 million by numbers) of <i>Saurida tumbil</i>, 1,671.4 t (142.9 million by numbers) of <i>Rastrelliger kanagurta</i> and 338.3 t (90.1 million by numbers) of <i>Nemipterus randalli</i> were landed as LVB per year by multiday trawlers. From the results it is evident that marine fisheries will be in serious threat in successive years if the similar trend continues.

In this review, we assemble and compose the current knowledge on four central themes: (1) distribution of dormancy in animals, with an overview on the phylogenetic distribution of embryo dormancy in metazoans, and (2) physiological and cellular processes involved in dormancy, with a strong emphasis on the dormant embryos of cyclically parthenogenetic monogonont rotifers; and discussions of (3) the selective pressures and (4) the evolutionary and population implications of dormancy in these animals. Dormancy in metazoans is a widespread phenomenon with taxon-specific features, and rotifers are among the animals in which dormancy is an intrinsic feature of their life cycle. Our review shows that embryo dormancy in rotifers shares common functional pathways with other taxa at the molecular and cellular level, despite the independent evolution of dormancy across phyla. These pathways include the arrest of similar metabolic routes and the usage of common metabolites for the stabilization of cellular structures and to confer stress resistance. We conclude that specific features of recurrent harsh environmental conditions are a powerful selective pressure for the fine-tuning of dormancy patterns in rotifers. We hypothesize that similar mechanisms at the organism level will lead to similar adaptive consequences at the population level across taxa, among which the formation of egg banks, the coexistence of species, and the possibility of differentiation among populations and local adaptation stand out. Our review shows how studies of rotifers have contributed to improved knowledge of all of these aspects.","García-Roger, E.M.; Lubzens, E.; Fontaneto, D.; Serra, M.",WOS:000497772200005,"Serra, Manuel, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1086/705701,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Valencia, Inst Cavanilles Biodiversitat & Biol Evolut, Valencia, Spain.",Spain,,HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; RESTING EGG BANKS; INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED PROTEINS; CLADOCERAN CERCOPAGIS-PENGOI; MICTIC FEMALE PRODUCTION; FRESH-WATER ZOOPLANKTON; BRACHIONUS-PLICATILIS; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; LIFE-HISTORY; STRESS TOLERANCE,Biology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Area (HSQCS‐MPA) was designated in February 2017 to protect 2,410&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of reef habitat. Efforts to establish baseline information regarding reef‐associated taxa in the new MPA have documented the diversity of megafauna in detail, but little is understood of the cryptic epifauna inhabiting hidden crevices within the reefs, and even less is understood of larval recruitment, the key reproductive process maintaining long‐term reef health and stability. We collected specimens of a reef‐building glass sponge, <i>Farrea occa</i>, from the HSQCS‐MPA and described the diversity of their epifauna. Five hundred and two organisms from six phyla were documented, including 84 sponges from three classes. We found several glass sponges: known juvenile reef builders (two <i>Aphrocallistes vastus</i> and two <i>Heterochone calyx</i>); the lyssacine sponge <i>Leucopsacus scoliodocus</i>, previously known in Canadian waters only from Jervis Inlet; and an unidentified dictyonine sponge previously unknown to waters of British Columbia. Also present were the carnivorous sponge <i>Lycopodina occidentalis</i>, 11 individuals of <i>Desmacella austini</i>, evidence for a new species in the subgenus <i>Haliclona</i> (<i>Flagellia</i>), and a clathrinid calcareous sponge. The growth stages we observed suggest multiple settlement events by glass sponge larvae between February and early March. Of the 502 invertebrates, 460 were attached to dead sponge skeleton despite live tissue being much more available as substrate. This study highlights trends in recruitment at sponge reefs, explores factors that may affect larval settlement, describes new sponge associations, and provides the first description of the range of macrofauna found on glass sponges, acting as a baseline for continued monitoring of the MPA.","Guillas, K.C.; Kahn, A.S.; Grant, N.; Archer, S.K.; Dunham, A.; Leys, S.P.",WOS:000491911200001,"Leys, Sally, S.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ivb.12266,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",Canada,glass sponge reef; Hexactinellida; marine protected area; Porifera; recruitment,BRITISH-COLUMBIA; HEXACTINELLID SPONGE; PORIFERA; REPRODUCTION; RECRUITMENT; PATTERNS; PACIFIC,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,,,,,,

A rapid and accurate biosurveillance tool tailored to a particular biogeographic region is needed to detect NIS when they are first introduced into an area as traditional detection methods are expensive and require specialized expertise. Metabarcoding of environmental and community DNA meets those biosurveillance requirements; a novel tool tailored to the Northwest Pacific Ocean is presented here using an approach that could revolutionize early detection of NIS. Eight newly designed genetic markers for multiple gene regions were implemented to meet the stringent taxonomic requirements for the detection of NIS across four major marine phyla. The tool was considered highly successful because it identified 12 known NIS in the study area and a further seven species representing potential new records. Overall community composition detected here was statistically different between substrate types; zooplankton sampling accounted for significantly higher species richness than filtered sea water in most cases, but this was dominated by mollusk and arthropod species. Both substrate types sampled were required to identify the wide taxonomic breadth of known NIS in the study area. Intensive sampling is known to be paramount for the detection of rare species, including new incursions of NIS, thus it is recommended to include diverse DNA sampling protocols based on species’ life‐history characteristics for broad detection capacity.

This article summarises the outcome of a fiveday group discussion on how global marine biodiversity studies should be focused further to better understand the patterns of biodiversity. We discussed and reviewed seven fundamental biodiversity priorities related to nine Aichi Targets focusing on global biodiversity discovery and predictions to improve and enhance biodiversity data standards (quantity and quality), tools and techniques, spatial and temporal scale framing, and stewardship and dissemination. We discuss how identifying biodiversity knowledge gaps and promoting efforts have and will reduce such gaps, including via the use of new databases, tools and technology, and how these resources could be improved in the future.

In this respect, we used GPS tracking data of lesser black-backed gulls caught and tagged in two colonies along the Belgian North Sea coast (Ostend and Zeebrugge) to study spatial patterns in the species’ presence and behaviour in and around the Thornton Bank offshore wind farm (OWF). We found a significant decrease in the number of GPS fixes of flying birds from up to a distance of at least 2000m towards the middle of the wind farm. Non-flying birds showed a similar avoidance of the wind farm interior, yet presence strongly peaked right at the wind farm’s edge, demonstrated to represent gulls perching on the outer turbine jacket foundations. The findings of this study reveal a strong within wind farm variability in bird density, a most crucial parameter in collision risk modelling. The method presented here is straightforward and similar studies conducted at other wind farm sites on a range of large gull species (<i>Larus</i> sp.) would allow to assess the potential and species specific variation in meso-scale response patterns and to gain insight in the underlying ecological incentives, which in turn would provide widely applicable and much-needed input for (cumulative) collision impact assessments.","Vanermen, N.; Courtens, W.; Daelemans, R.; Lens, L.; Müller, W.; Van de walle, M.; Verstraete, H.; Stienen, E.",WOS:000536430100022,"Lens, Luc, L.","Terrestrial Ecological Unit (TEREC), Ghent University",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icesjms/fsz199,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,avoidance; collision risk; GPS telemetry; impact assessment; lesserblack-backed gull; offshore wind farm,Journal article,,,"Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Havenlaan 88 Box 73, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Belgium,avoidance; collision risk; GPS telemetry; impact assessment; lesser black-backed gull; offshore wind farm,MARINE BIRD POPULATIONS; HARNESS ATTACHMENT; LARUS-FUSCUS; MODELS; SEABIRDS; DISCARDS,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Terrestrial Ecology Unit (TEREC) ,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

This core was obtained from the northern part of the Sukumo Plain in southwestern Shikoku Island, which faces the warm Kuroshio Current. The drilling site is located in an area of subsidence associated with the convergence of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. On analyses of lithology, molluscan assemblages, and radiocarbon dating, we interpreted, from oldest to youngest, nine units: basement rock, a braided river channel, a meandering river channel, an estuary, a transgressive inner bay, Kikai-Akahoya volcanic ash, a deltaic inner bay, a tidal flat, and artificial soil. Changes in the depositional environment were mainly associated with sea-level rise after the end of the last glaciation. The reservoir ages of the eight pairs, 330 ± 70 yr, were obtained from a transgressive inner bay to deltaic inner bay sediments, formed during 4100–9200 cal BP. The chronological change in the reservoir effect allows us to correlate the Sukumo Core sediments with previous results from southwestern Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and Taiwan Island.","Nakanishi, T.; Tsuji, T.; Nanayama, F.; Yamaguchi, T.; Kondo, Y.; Ikeda, M.; Hong, W.",WOS:000504752800031,"Nakanishi, Toshimichi, T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1017/rdc.2019.129,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Kuroshio Current,,"Holocene, ""Radiocarbon dating""",,sedimentary facies,Journal article,,,"Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Tono Geosci Ctr, 959-31 Jorinji,Izumi Cho, Toki, Gifu 5095102, Japan.",Japan,Holocene; Kuroshio Current; marine reservoir; radiocarbon dating; sedimentary facies,MARINE RESERVOIR CORRECTION; EASTERN COAST; PACIFIC COAST; PAIRS; ERUPTION; ISLAND; RIVER; SEA; BAY,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Geochemistry & Geophysics,,,,,,

This study investigates the coherency and validity of Macaronesia as a biogeographic unit using six marine groups with very different dispersal abilities: coastal fishes, echinoderms, gastropod molluscs, brachyuran decapod crustaceans, polychaete annelids, and macroalgae. We found no support for the current concept of Macaronesia as a coherent marine biogeographic unit. All marine groups studied suggest the exclusion of Cabo Verde from the remaining Macaronesian archipelagos and thus, Cabo Verde should be given the status of a biogeographic subprovince within the West African Transition province. We propose to redefine the Lusitanian biogeographical province, in which we include four ecoregions: the South European Atlantic Shelf, the Saharan Upwelling, the Azores, and a new ecoregion herein named Webbnesia, which comprises the archipelagos of Madeira, Selvagens and the Canary Islands.","Freitas, Rui; Romeiras, Maria; Silva, Luís; Cordeiro, Ricardo; Madeira, Patrícia; González, José Antonio; Wirtz, Peter; Falcón, Jesús M.; Brito, Alberto; Floeter, Sergio R.; Afonso, Pedro; Porteiro, Filipe; Viera-Rodríguez, María Ascensión; Neto, Ana Isabel; Haroun, Ricardo; Farminhão, João N.

Starting in 1990, farmers and producers began the production of organic salmon. It was implemented with a heavy focus on environmental sustainability. There are currently two organically certified salmon producers in Norway who are subject to regulations which are intended to limit – or ideally to entirely avoid – environmental harm. In particular, organic certification requires that salmon have larger cages and are fed with organic fish trimmings. Additionally, organic farms must comply with different regulations for vaccination and water oxygen to conventional farms. The resulting organic product is natural in color and has a different structure of omega 3-fat compared to the conventional reference product. The value chain of organic salmon in Norway is highly regulated and is characterized by strong governance at farm level. Furthermore, the farming, processing, and retailing of this supply chain is well integrated as these three levels often overlap. Comparing organic and conventional salmon production across several indicators of economic, social, and environmental sustainability, this chapter offers some insight into both supply chains. Organic salmon performs slightly better in terms of economic sustainability (mostly driven by consumer prices and profitability) and environmental sustainability as a whole. Results for social sustainability are mixed although in absolute terms, both supply chains are fairly sustainable in terms of equal gender opportunities.","Steinnes, K.K.; Amilien, V.; Vittersø, G.",,"Steinnes, Kamilla Knutsen, K.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-27508-2_27,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their archaeological and ethnographic importance, these shells remain poorly and inconsistently reported in the archaeological literature. The absence of standardized data on species composition, size, and condition of cowrie assemblages, and whether and how the shells were modified, make it difficult to examine their significance in a regional and chronological framework. To address this problem, we propose a set of standardized criteria and coding system for recording cowrie assemblages—in particular, species, size, condition, and state of modification. We aim to enable nonshell specialists within the wider archaeological community to securely identify intact or modified specimens of <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">M. annulus</em> and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">M. moneta</em>, showing how these can be distinguished from four cowrie species native to West Africa—<em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Luria lurida</em> (Linnaeus, 1758), <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Zonaria zonaria</em> (Gmelin, 1791), <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Zonaria sanguinolenta</em> (Gmelin, 1791), and <em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic "">Trona stercoraria</em> (Linnaeus, 1758). We demonstrate how accurate species identification and the assessment of proportions of different sizes of shells within suitably large assemblages can provide insight into their provenance. This information can enhance our appreciation of the exchange networks within which these shells moved. We also identify five different strategies documented in the archaeological record that were used to modify cowries, detailing how these can be differentiated and classified. The aim here is to suggest a recording strategy that will enable comparisons of the use and value of cowries in West Africa and elsewhere.","Christie, A.C.; Grant, A.; Haour, A.",WOS:000500290300002,"Christie, Annalisa, A.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10437-019-09351-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Cowrie shells; Recording strategy; West Africa; Cowrie modification ,Journal article,,,"Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",Ireland,Cowrie shells; Recording strategy; West Africa; Cowrie modification,GASTROPODA; MORPHOLOGY; MOLLUSCA; ISLAND,Anthropology; Archaeology,Anthropology; Archaeology,,,,,,

In addition, we established a diatom-total phosphorus transfer (DTPT) function, of which component 5 of the weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WAPLS) was chosen to and compared with a series of weighted average regression (WA) models and WA-PLS models.

Here I review how molecular methods have aided the description of new species as well as the characterization of phylogenetic diversity within species, and also broadened our understanding of the biogeography of this family. Multiple regional analyses have shown that the coastal habitat appears to drive diversity and diversification in generally similar ways regardless of location, while a global perspective allows us to identify regions and questions that merit further study.

Such studies have been impeded by a largely formalistic taxonomy, because rhizocephalan morphology offers no characters for a robust phylogenetic analysis. We use DNA sequence data to estimate a new phylogeny for 43 species and use this to develop a revised taxonomy for all Rhizocephala. Our taxonomy accepts 13 new or redefined monophyletic families. The traditional subdivision into the suborders Kentrogonida and Akentrogonida is abandoned, because both are polyphyletic. The three ‘classical’ kentrogonid families are also polyphyletic, including the species-rich Sacculinidae, which is split into a redefined and a new family. Most species of large families remain to be studied based on molecular evidence and are therefore still assigned to their current genus and family by default. We caution against undue generalizations from studies on model species until a more stable species-level taxonomy is also available, which requires more extensive genus- and species-level sampling with molecular tools.

The data analysis points out that the quantity and quality of the seafloor's organic matter could be a crucial controlling factor for the faunal succession. During 550–1000 AD (within the Medieval Climate Anomaly), the relatively high benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates together with the predominance of meso-eutrophic taxa, such as <em>Bolivina dilatata</em>/<em>spathulata</em>, may be interpreted as the result of high precipitation. Consequently, increased riverine discharges into the North Aegean Sea and the associated warm climatic conditions appear to persist for a long time and are related to a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Later on, the establishment of an oligo-mesotrophic seafloor environment is documented by the diminishing benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates associated with an increment in the abundances of <em>Gyroidinoides altiformis</em>. During a colder phase of the Little Ice Age (17th century), the relative abundances of the opportunistic foraminiferal species <em>Bulimina inflata</em> and <em>Bulimina marginata</em> can be related to high marine productivity, most probably due to enhanced winter mixing conditions. Finally, during the last 100 years, a faunal shift to eutrophication preferent species, and the persistent occurrence of <em>Chilostomella mediterranensis</em>, reflects a pronounced change in trophic conditions, characterized by high amounts of potentially low-quality organic matter in the seafloor, which are the result of a gradual temperature increase accompanied with enhanced terrigenous inputs.","Dimiza, M.D.; Fatourou, M.; Arabas, A.; Panagiotopoulos, I.; Gogou, A.; Kouli, K.; Parinos, C.; Rousakis, G.; Triantaphyllou, M.V.",WOS:000518878000022,"Fatourou, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2019.104705,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Benthic foraminifera variation; Organic matter fluxes; Major climatic events,Journal article,,,"Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Fac Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens 15784, Greece.",Greece,Benthic foraminifera variation; Organic matter fluxes; Major climatic events,HOLOCENE CLIMATE VARIABILITY; WATER MASS CHARACTERISTICS; ORGANIC-CARBON; PLANKTONIC-FORAMINIFERA; ECOSYSTEM VARIABILITY; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ADRIATIC SEA; NITROGEN; MICROHABITAT,Oceanography,Oceanography,,,,,,

Colonial ascidians, in particular, have broad environmental tolerances that allow them to invade novel ecosystems including urban harbors. While the effects of invasive species and poor water quality on native species have been explored, the relative influence and how these pressures may interact to degrade biodiversity is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was therefore to understand the role of interspecific competition and pollution on the native <i>Aplidium glabrum</i> and the invasive <i>Botrylloides violaceus</i>.

Conversely, significant impacts to <i>B. violaceus</i> growth did not occur until much higher copper concentrations with an EC50 of 37.1 μg/L while alone and 31.7 μg/L when in competition.

However, despite the anthropogenic nature of these threats, socioeconomic factors are often given less consideration than their ecological counterparts when designating SLMPAs. In this paper, we identified and examined relevant national-level socioeconomic data to determine the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing SLMPAs, focussing on least developed and low income countries. We aimed to use these socioeconomic data to identify nations where SLMPAs are more likely to be successful in providing conservation benefits to sharks. We used principal component analysis to develop two national-level indices that represent these anticipated opportunities and challenges for implementing SLMPAs across 87 coastal nations. The Opportunity Index identifies those nations in which socioeconomic conditions such as adaptive capacity, and strong and fair governance, are favourable for SLMPAs to provide conservation benefits to sharks. The Challenge Index identifies those nations that may not yet be in a position developmentally to support communities to adapt to a loss of access to resources associated with SLMPAs, or to manage and enforce broad scale restrictive legislation. In combination with biophysical considerations, the Challenge and Opportunity indices presented here can support policy makers in deciding whether, and in what cases, SLMPAs are the most appropriate measure to provide conservation benefits to sharks.","Mizrahi, M.; Duce, S.; Pressey, R.L.; Simpfendorfer, C.A.; Weeks, R.; Diedrich, A.",WOS:000468718500013,"Mizrahi, Me'ira, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.03.026,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Marine protected areas; Conservation science; Social science; Environmental management; Livelihoods; Shark conservation,Journal article,,,"Satia Apartments,St 454, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",Cambodia,Marine protected areas; Conservation science; Social science; Environmental management; Livelihoods; Shark conservation,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS; TOURISM; FISHERS; IMPACTS; PARKS; RAYS; EXIT,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Hydrocarbon extractive activities pose threats to native marine biodiversity, such as noise, light, and chemical pollution, physical changes to the sea floor, invasive species, and greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we assessed at a global scale the spatial overlap between offshore hydrocarbon activities and marine biodiversity (>25,000 species, nine major ecosystems, and marine protected areas), and quantify the changes over time. We discovered that two‐thirds of global offshore hydrocarbon activities occur in areas within the top 10% for species richness, range rarity, and proportional range rarity values globally. Thus, while hydrocarbon activities are undertaken in less than one percent of the ocean's area, they overlap with approximately 85% of all assessed species. Of conservation concern, 4% of species with the largest proportion of their range overlapping hydrocarbon activities are range restricted, potentially increasing their vulnerability to localized threats such as oil spills. While hydrocarbon activities have extended to greater depths since the mid‐1990s, we found that the largest overlap is with coastal ecosystems, particularly estuaries, saltmarshes and mangroves. Furthermore, in most countries where offshore hydrocarbon exploration licensing blocks have been delineated, they do not overlap with marine protected areas (MPAs). Although this is positive in principle, many countries have far more licensing block areas than protected areas, and in some instances, MPA coverage is minimal. These findings suggest the need for marine spatial prioritization to help limit future spatial overlap between marine conservation priorities and hydrocarbon activities. Such prioritization can be informed by the spatial and quantitative baseline information provided here. In increasingly shared seascapes, prioritizing management actions that set both conservation and development targets could help minimize further declines of biodiversity and environmental changes at a global scale.","Venegas-Li, R.; Levin, N.; Morales-Barquero, L.; Kaschner, K.; Garilao, C.; Kark, S.",WOS:000467441900012,"Kark, Salit, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.14616,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers Res Grp, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",Australia,energy; marine biodiversity; ocean; offshore hydrocarbon; oil and gas; species richness,CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM; OIL; PROSPECTS; SERVICES; RISKS; AREAS; GULF,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

However, EEZs might not be respected by unauthorized resource users because the cost of monitoring and enforcing such large areas may be prohibitive. Here we provide the first evidence that EEZs are in fact respected by unauthorized resource users. Using global, high-resolution fishing effort datasets and the ecologically arbitrary boundaries between EEZs and the high seas, we find that unauthorized foreign fishing is 81% lower just inside EEZs compared to just outside. Consistent with the high cost of enforcing EEZ boundaries, this deterrence effect is concentrated in EEZs that are most valuable near their boundaries.

Our findings illustrate that both human well-being and biodiversity conservation can be improved through marine protected areas, yet negative impacts commonly co-occur with benefits.","Ban, N.C.; Gurney, G.G.; Marshall, N.A.; Whitney, C.K.; Mills, M.; Gelcich, S.; Bennett, N.J.; Meehan, M.C.; Butler, C.; Ban, S.; Tran, T.C.; Cox, M.E.; Breslow, S.J.",WOS:000471032700017,"Whitney, Charlotte, C.K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41893-019-0306-2,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada.",Canada,,CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; RESERVES; IMPACTS; SUSTAINABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; FRAMEWORK; FISHERIES; CONFLICT; BENEFITS,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Victoria,x,Canada,,University,Science

The reef-building corals and reef-inhabiting fish have a mutually symbiotic relationship, with corals providing food and habitat while depending on the grazing by certain fish for reproductive success. This research aims to investigate the coral reef condition and also the community structure of the reef fish in the Mahakam Delta. This study was conducted in July 2018, in Muara Ilu, Mahakam Delta. We observed the coral reef area and reef fish at 6 sites throughout the Mahakam River mouth. The condition of coral reefs and reef fish is assessed through scuba diving activities, using the video belt transect method, while reef fish surveys were done by the operated video transect diver method. The results showed that the coral reefs in the Muara Ilu waters of Tani Baru Village, Anggana District, Kutai Kartanegara Regency, have an area of 36.36 Ha, consisting of two stretches, ""Batu Laut Muara Ilu"", covering an area of 35.11 Ha and ""Batu Darat Muara Ilu"", covering 1.25 Ha. The percentage of live coral cover ranges from 2% to 46.4%, with an overall average of 28.5%, which is classified in moderate/moderate coral reef conditions. The reef fish community data from twelve transects showed high diversity and stable fish communities in the coral reef ecosystem from the study sites. The index values obtained are: H’=2.60; E=0.65; C=0.13. In conclusion, the diversity of reef fish was in the medium category, even distribution of species was present and no dominance by certain types was observed.","Syahrir, M.; Hanjoko, T.; Adnan, A.; Yasser, M.; Efendi, M.; Budiarsa, A.A.; Raafi, M.; Bulan, D.E.",,"Syahrir, Muhammad, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"coral, diversity index, Muara Ilu, reef fish",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such modifications create visible biogenic structures and associated microhabitats, which may have negative and/or positive effects on small-sized benthic communities. A series of dives with the submersible ALVIN was undertaken at the long-term monitoring Station M (4000 m, NE Pacific) in August 2006 to investigate, among other things, the influence of different biogenic structures on meiofauna and nematode assemblages. Five different biogenic structures were sampled; the tracks of two different species of sea urchins (<em>Cystocrepis</em> and <em>Echinocrepis</em>), one bioturbation mound, one decomposing kelp aggregate and one sponge. These were compared to a number of control samples taken away from the influence of the biogenic structures. Meiofauna ranged between 241 and 1277 ind per 10 cm<sup>2</sup> and was dominated by nematodes, with their contribution ranging from 74% to 89%. The comparison of the meiofauna communities from the biogenic structures and the control samples indicated differences between microhabitats for meiofaunal composition and nematode functional groups, which were due to differences between the microhabitats at the mound. The bioturbation mound and the control area hosted the highest number of nematode genera, though statistical analysis did not indicate significant differences. Beta diversity analysis revealed higher variability of meiofauna between than within different biogenic structures, suggesting habitat heterogeneity that may contribute substantially to the overall deep-sea richness. It may be concluded that among the studied biogenic structures, the bioturbation mound appears to be critical in shaping deep-sea meiobenthic communities.","Lampadariou, N.; Syranidou, E.; Sevastou, K.; Tselepides, A.",WOS:000527944700006,"Sevastou, Katerina, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2019.104720,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Deep sea; Biogenic structures; Meiofauna; Nematoda; Pacific; Station M,Journal article,,,"Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, POB 2214, GR-71003 Iraklion, Crete, Greece.",Greece,Deep sea; Biogenic structures; Meiofauna; Nematoda; Pacific; Station M,DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES; HABITAT HETEROGENEITY; HARPACTICOID COPEPODS; EPIBENTHIC MEGAFAUNA; DIVERSITY PATTERNS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; MEIOFAUNA; COMMUNITIES; MACROFAUNA; PREDATION,Oceanography,Oceanography,,,,,,

A set of samples was devoted to foraminiferal analysis while the other, set B, for sediment analyses. <em>In situ</em> hydrographical parameters such as temperature, salinity, pH, turbidity and DO were measured at surface waters. The top 1 cm was subsampled for foraminiferal analyses from the grab and preserved using 70% ethanol with Rose-Bengal stain. Potentially Toxic Elements (PTE) levels in sediment and grain size distributions were analysed. The dataset is expected to provide a baseline for PTE levels in sediment, benthic foraminiferal communities, and identify endemic species adapted to extremes of temperature and saline conditions typical of the Gulf. It can also be used by environmental managers, micropaleotologists, students in environmental/geology/marine science as reference background conditions based on sediment toxicity and benthic community information in revising environmental guidelines in the region. Data from this study suggest that PTEs are within the range of background values, and the sediments support highly diversified and stable benthic foraminiferal communities adapted to the unique environmental conditions in the Gulf. To date, this dataset documents the highest number of living benthic foraminifera species reported from the Gulf, and the most diverse living community compared to all previous studies.

Focus of this study is to determine the consistency between scientific results and minimum landing size (MLS) regulations in the marine fishery of Turkey. For this purpose, 4/1 communique on commercial fishery (2016/35) published by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was investigated in order to expose the MLS of given species in Turkey. Literature survey on Lm was also conducted preferably on studies which were performed in Turkish waters or from the Mediterranean basin in order to avoid regional differences. While 86 marine species were reported to be landed in the official fishery statistics, only 49 of them were appointed with a MLS in the commercial fisheries regulation. It was determined that MLS of 27 species were below the Lm according to the selected literature, 7 of them require result on Lm, status of the 2 species couldn’t be decided due to different length types and 13 (27% of the decisions on MLS) of them were found to be in accordance with the scientific literature on Lm. This study shows that MLS regulation must be revised for most of the species in the surrounding waters of Turkey and comprehensive maturity studies are urgently needed in order to fulfill the scientific gap.","Soykan, O.",,"Soykan, Ozan, O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.24925/turjaf.v7isp1.27-31.2680,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Minimum landing size; length at maturity; commercial fishing; Marine Fishery; Turkey,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally gastropods are crawling on the bottom of the waters and submerged in the mud and are often called epifauna and infauna gastropods. Research on diversity of epifauna gastropods in the littoral zone has been done in Mesjid Raya, Aceh Besar District. This research aims to determine the diversity of gastropod species based on the substrate types (coral reef, muddy and sandy). The exploratory method by using transect line was used in this study. In each substrate, a line transect was drawn for five transects with a length of 50 m. The transects were started from the tidal line. The distance between transects were 50 m. Each transect was made in 10 sampling plots measuring lm <b>×</b> lm, and the distance between plots was 5m. The gastropods were collected directly and without damaging the substrates. The epifauna gastropods obtained was put into a sample bottle and preserved using 70% alcohol. The results showed that 23 families and 54 species of epifauna gastropods were identified. The number of species of gstropods was found in the sandy and muddy substrate more than in the sandy and corral reef substrate, but the highest diversity index was found in the sandy substrate, meanwhile the lowest diversity was found in the coral reef substrate.

Large- and small-scale fishing plays an important role in the local economy, so we investigated the dynamic processes of bioaccumulation of mercury at basal trophic levels. Four samples were taken at each of the four locations in Buenaventura Bay during each of the four seasons of 2015. We measured the total mercury content (T-Hg, dry weight) in sediments and in muscle tissue across 17 macroinvertebrate species. The most abundant were the blue crab (<i>C. arcuatus</i>) and the mantis shrimp (<i>S. aculeata aculeata</i>). Blue crab showed an average muscle T-Hg value ​​exceeding the limit of 0.2 g·g<sup>-1</sup>, which is the maximum T-Hg level suggested for food consumption by vulnerable humans and populations: pregnant women, children, and the community that feeds from this source of protein on a daily basis. It was found that, 6.22% of individuals exceeded the 0.5 g·g<sup>-1</sup> level, which is the maximum T-Hg level suggested for food consumption by the general population: the population that consumes it sporadically. Significantly high values ​​of T-Hg in blue crab and mantis shrimp occurred during low salinity conditions in the estuary, suggesting that Hg mainly originates from river runoff during the rainy season. Nevertheless, the biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) was favored in high salinity, which could mean greater availability of Hg for higher levels of the estuarine food web in the dry season and in marine waters. In general, the T-Hg levels in some samples exceeded 0.2 g·g<sup>−1</sup>. Therefore this pollutant must be monitored due to its biomagnification potential and as a threat to human health, especially that for the local population of fishermen and their families.","Gamboa-García, D.E.; Duque, G.; Cogua, P.; Marrugo-Negrete, J.L.",WOS:000519703100043,"Cogua, Pilar, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11356-019-06970-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Santiago Cali, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Cali, Colombia.",Colombia,Epibenthic invertebrates; Tropical estuary; Human health; Artisanal fisheries; Macroinvertebrates,CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS; ORGANIC-MATTER; FRESH-WATER; BLUE CRABS; SEDIMENTS; BIOACCUMULATION; METHYLMERCURY; FISH; CONTAMINATION; SPECIATION,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Sampling was carried out in September of 2009, 2014, and 2015 (autumn) and June 2015 (summer). A total of ten tunicate species were identified belonging to the classes Appendicularia and Thaliacea during the above periods throughout the area. Considering the limited diversity of these organisms worldwide (40 species are identified in each class), we affirm that Kueishantao, a shallow water hydrothermal vent field, with 10 species provided an unexpected biodiversity hot spot for pelagic tunicates. The sampling of the organisms in the surface waters provided higher abundances compared to oblique tows.

The presence of a gravid female with relatively small oocytes (maximum diameter 56.94 ± 14.89 μm) suggests that <em>N. chondrocladiae</em> n. comb<em>.</em> is a gonochoristic broadcaster with a planktotrophic larva, a means of reproduction that would maximize the chances of this species finding new suitable hosts to colonize.

Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem‐wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long‐term, spatio‐temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long‐term surveys (30–40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time‐series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem‐wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate‐driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi‐trophic trait‐based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem‐wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.","Pecuchet, L.; Lindegren, M.; Kortsch, S.; Calkiewicz, J.; Jurgensone, I.; Margonski, P.; Otto, S.A.; Putnis, I.; Strake, S.; Nordström, M.C.",WOS:000496965900001,"Margonski, Piotr, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/ecog.04643,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland.",Finland,climate change; community dynamics; eutrophication; functional reorganisation; multi-trophic; temperature,SEA FISH COMMUNITY; BALTIC SEA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; SPECIES TRAITS; REGIME SHIFT; BIODIVERSITY; DRIVERS; PLANT; PATTERNS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Åbo Akademi University - Department of Bioscience Environment and Marine Biology,x,Finland,,University,Science

New indices introduced as new sexual dimorphic characters of size and shape, namely heterometry (right chela size/left chela size) and heteromorphy (Procrustes distance between right and left chelae shape), revealed sexually dimorphic differences in diverse crab species. We demonstrate that both size and shape heterochely occur amongst the examined species, but there are no ecological correlations.

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using available molecular data for the order Brisingida. The intraspecific and interspecific divergence within <em>Freyastera</em> are recognized from a <em>COI</em> genetic distance matrix, in which some abnormal intraspecific distances are found between the known species, which might indicate the existence of cryptic species and an underestimated diversity in the genus.

Here, we assessed the species richness S and taxonomic distinctness Δ+ (used a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) of crustacean zooplankton assemblages from 40 ponds and small lakes located in Albania and North Macedonia and tested whether they could be predicted by waterbodies’ landscape characteristics (area, perimeter, and altitude), together with local bioclimatic conditions that were derived from Wordclim and MODIS databases. The results showed that a minimum adequate model, including the positive effects of non-arboreal vegetation cover and temperature seasonality, together with the negative influence of the mean temperature of the wettest quarter, effectively predicted assemblages’ variation in species richness. In contrast, taxonomic distinctness did not predictably respond to landscape or bioclimatic factors. Noticeably, waterbodies’ area showed a generally low prediction power for both S and Δ+. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of assemblages’ species composition indicated the occurrence of two distinct groups of waterbodies characterized by different species and different precipitation and temperature regimes. Our findings indicated that the classical species-area relationship hypothesis is inadequate in explaining the diversity of crustacean zooplankton assemblages characterizing the waterbodies under analysis. In contrast, local bioclimatic factors might affect the species richness and composition, but not their phylogenetic diversity, the latter likely to be influenced by long-term adaptation mechanisms.","Mancinelli, G.; Mali, S.; Belmonte, G.",WOS:000502264500186,"Mancinelli, Giorgio, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/w11112384,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,crustacean zooplankton; species richness; phylogenetic diversity; bioclimate; freshwater ponds,Journal article,,,"Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol DiSTeBA, Lab Zoogeg & Fauna, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",Italy,crustacean zooplankton; species richness; phylogenetic diversity; bioclimate; freshwater ponds,FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; MOUNTAIN PONDS; MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; CRUSTACEA COPEPODA; CANONICAL-ANALYSIS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; SIZE; LANDSCAPE; CALANOIDA,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,University of Salento,x,Italy,,University,Science

To investigate impacts of elevation levels on ecosystem functioning, we focused on macrozoobenthos as an essential ecosystem component that links trophic levels and determines sediment structure. Therefore, three elevation levels of six experimental islands (each 2 × 6 m) and six natural reference sites (nearby tidal flats) were sampled for species richness, abundance and biomass in the back-barrier system of the island of Spiekeroog (German Wadden Sea, southern North Sea) from 2014 to 2016. Reference sites had constant biodiversity and abundance over time that were higher compared to the three elevations of the experimental islands. At the lowest elevation, the community became more diverse over time, including marine and terrestrial taxa. At the middle elevation, community shifted from a marine species inventory over an opportunist-dominated assemblage to a less diverse community dominated by Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta). The community of the highest elevation mostly remained constant, resembling the second, opportunistic community from the middle elevation that was dominated by the snail <em>Peringia ulvae</em> (Pennant, 1777) and the oligochaetes Enchytraeidae spp. and <em>Tubificoides benedii</em> (d'Udekem, 1855). Correspondingly, food web structure was more complex and comprised more trophic interactions at the lowest elevation compared to the other elevations mainly inhabited by deposit feeders.

With climate and population-related pressures predicted to intensify in the coming decades, it is increasingly crucial to develop cost-effective and accurate monitoring tools to document changes to these important ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) coupled with metabarcoding is a powerful tool for surveying a wide variety of biota. Here, we develop a baseline eDNA toolkit targeting scleractinian corals and validate its performance in conjunction with data derived on traditional diver-based visual surveys at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Three assays targeting the ITS2 and 16S barcoding regions were designed, which broadly detected diversity within Scleractinia and Porifera. Our eDNA assays recovered 78 ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 25 scleractinian genera which is comparable to the level of diversity recorded on visual surveys (68 species from 26 genera). There were some notable differences in the species detected using eDNA versus visual records that may relate to either misidentifications, intragenic variation, differential assay performance or cryptic species. Our data demonstrate that a multi-assay eDNA analytical approach, applied on surface water collections, represents a powerful and complementary way to survey diversity that can also reveal fine scale spatial differentiation in community composition. With further refinement and improved reference databases, we envisage eDNA to become a powerful complement to visual surveys and to play a key role in monitoring the health and diversity of complex coral reefs ecosystems.","Alexander, J.B.; Bunce, M.; White, N.; Wilkinson, S.P.; Adam, A.A.S.; Berry, T.; Stat, M.; Thomas, L.; Newman, S.J.; Dugal, L.; Richards, Z.T.",WOS:000498045000001,"Alexander, Jason, J.B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00338-019-01875-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; Biomonitoring; Coral reefs; Environmental DNA; Scleractinia ,Journal article,,,"Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Trace & Environm DNA TrEnD Lab, Coral Conservat & Res Grp, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",Australia,Biodiversity; Biomonitoring; Coral reefs; Environmental DNA; Scleractinia,CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY CHANGE; CHRISTMAS ISLAND; DNA; REEFS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Curtin University - School of Molecular and Life Scieces - Department of Environment and Agriculture - TrEnD Lab (Trace & Environmental DNA),x,,,,

Status of polychaete (Annelida) taxonomy in Indonesia, including a checklist of Indonesian species. <i>Raffles Bull. Zool. 67</i>: 595-639","Despite some past remarkable marine expeditions in the seas surrounding the Indo-Malay Archipelago, a checklist of Indonesian polychaete species has never been published to date. In this paper, an inventory of species was created based mainly on existing published literature. All records of Indonesian polychaetes were mapped, and this indicated a preponderance of deep-sea records in the Wallacea region, which were primarily collected by the Dutch Siboga Expedition at the turn of the 19th century. Most biodiversity studies on the fauna by local scientists have been ecological in nature and conducted in shallow water. Many specimens were not identified to species level and not vouchered in a recognised institution. Since the mid 1700s, 580 valid polychaete species (51 families) have been identified by 37 first authors in 90 taxonomic publications. Of these species, 301 species (40 families) were new to science and mostly described by R. Horst and M. Caullery. An additional 133 polychaete species and four polychaete families are also known from the species records of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. Altogether, there have been 713 polychaete species (55 families) identified from Indonesian waters. We examined the three largest polychaete repositories in Indonesia – the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense in Bogor, Research Center for Deep Sea in Ambon, and Research Center for Oceanography in Jakarta – and found that the collections at each institution were mostly unidentified, unpublished, and not databased, suggesting that the taxonomic study of the polychaete fauna, at least locally, has been largely overlooked. Despite some challenges, international collaborative research may be the solution to improve the knowledge of the polychaete fauna of this species-rich, yet poorly known geographic region.","Pamungkas, J.; Glasby, C.J.",WOS:000511852700019,"Pamungkas, Joko, J.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Coral Triangle, Indonesia, Polychaeta, species inventory",Journal article,,,"Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Coral Triangle; Indonesia; Polychaeta; species inventory,AMBON ISLAND; DIVERSITY; SYLLIDAE; CAPITELLIDAE; COMMENSAL; MARINE; COAST,Zoology,Zoology,University of Auckland - Institute of Marine Science,x,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

They also play important roles in coastal and marine ecosystems by filtering the water and serving as habitat and prey for a variety of sea life. Due to the increasing trends of environmental contaminations in recent years, many bivalves have been using as a potential biomarker for assessing the worse environment. Moreover, the shell of a bivalve is comprised of calcium carbonate, which may support thousands of calciferous organisms into the water body. Mostly, bivalves inhabit the tropics, as well as temperate and boreal waters, and they can survive and even flourish in extreme environmental conditions like Bangladesh. Nowadays, many bivalve molluscs have been identified as a superior source of bioactive compounds and are using for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical purposes as well as other applications. However, until now, few systematic studies on marine bivalve molluscs have been conducted through which a total of 437 marine and brackish water species were identified and recorded in Bangladesh. But still, our knowledge of taxonomy and systematic on marine molluscs are primitive in the context of the country. Here we report two new species of bivalve molluscs, <em>Parvicardium exiguum</em> and <em>Trachycardium procerum</em> belonging to the family Cardiidae, from the Kutubdia Island of Bangladesh. The study added these two bivalve species, which has not been recorded from the coastal zone of Kutubdia Island during the previous studies. To sum up, studies and survey on taxonomy and systematics in marine bivalves will provide new dimensions for further research about these important marine invertebrates.","Islam, M.R.; Nirob, S.S.; Molla, M.H.R.; Rahman, K.; Haque, M.M.; Rahman, M.A.; Khan, S.; Alom, M.Z.",,"Khan, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.9734/ARRB/2019/v33i630137,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Molluscs, non-native species, new records, Kutubdia Island",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason for the toxicity lies in the lack of selectivity for cancer cells of the vast majority of anticancer agents. Thus, the need for new potent anticancer compounds characterized by a better toxicological profile is compelling. Lectins belong to a particular class of non-immunogenic glycoproteins and have the characteristics to selectively bind specific sugar sequences on the surface of cells. This property is exploited to exclusively bind cancer cells and exert antitumor activity through the induction of different forms of regulated cell death and the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Thanks to the extraordinary biodiversity, marine environments represent a unique source of active natural compounds with anticancer potential. Several marine and freshwater organisms, ranging from the simplest alga to the most complex vertebrate, are amazingly enriched in these proteins. Remarkably, all studies gathered in this review show the impressive anticancer effect of each studied marine lectin combined with irrelevant toxicity in vitro and in vivo and pave the way to design clinical trials to assess the real antineoplastic potential of these promising proteins. It provides a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.","Catanzaro, E.; Calcabrini, C.; Bishayee, A.; Fimognari, C.",WOS:000513184600012,"Catanzaro, Elena, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/md18010011,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,marine lectins; cancer; cancer therapy; in vitro studies; in vivo studies; natural products,Journal article,,,"Lake Erie Coll Osteopath Med, Bradenton, FL 34211 USA.",USA,marine lectins; cancer; cancer therapy; in vitro studies; in vivo studies; natural products,ACID-BINDING LECTIN; RANA-CATESBEIANA RIBONUCLEASE; BURKITTS-LYMPHOMA CELLS; C-TYPE LECTIN; MUSSEL CRENOMYTILUS-GRAYANUS; SPONGE HALICLONA-CAERULEA; HALIOTIS-DISCUS-DISCUS; CANCER-CELLS; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY,"Chemistry, Medicinal; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,,,,,

Marine bivalves are frequently subjects of ocean acidification (OA) research because of their perceived vulnerability, which also threatens loss of their valuable ecosystem services. Studies indicate that larvae of many broadcast spawning oyster and mussel species are physiologically sensitive to alterations in carbonate chemistry. Running counter to this trend are recent investigations of brooding oyster species (genus <i>Ostrea</i>) that suggest their offspring may be considerably more resistant to OA stress. Although the precise mechanism conferring OA resistance to <i>Ostrea</i> larvae is unknown, a strong candidate appears to be exaptation of traits developing embryos that require to cope with adverse carbonate conditions they typically encounter in the brood chamber. New and previously reported data on <i>Ostrea</i> brood chamber conditions are discussed in the context of OA. Novel technical and experimental approaches are offered to address current knowledge gaps in future studies.","Gray, M.W.; Chaparro, O.; Huebert, K.B.; O'Neill, S.P.; Couture, T.; Moreira, A.; Brady, D.C.",WOS:000504763000026,"Gray, Matthew, M.W.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.2983/035.038.0326,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.",USA,Ostrea; brooding; ocean acidification; life history,CHILENSIS PHILIPPI; CHILEAN OYSTER; OLYMPIA OYSTER; MARINE INVERTEBRATE; PACIFIC OYSTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH-RATE; REDUCED PH; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Some of the most-studied <i>Mytilus</i> species are <i>M. edulis</i>, <i>M. galloprovincialis</i>, <i>M. chilensis</i> and <i>M. trossulus</i>. As species identification based on morphological characteristics of <i>Mytilus</i> specimens is difficult, molecular markers are often used. Single-locus markers can give conflicting results when used independently; not all markers differentiate among all species, and the markers target genomic regions with different evolutionary histories. We evaluated the concordance between the PCR-RFLP markers most commonly-used for species identification in mussels within the <i>Mytilus</i> genus (<i>Me15-16</i>, <i>ITS</i>, <i>mac-1</i>, <i>16S rRNA</i> and <i>CO</i>I) when used alone (mono-locus approach) or together (multi-locus approach). In this study, multi-locus strategy outperformed the mono-locus methods, clearly identifying all four species and also showed similar specimen identification performance than a 49 SNPs panel. We hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of DNA marker-based analysis of <i>Mytilus</i> taxa. These results support the use of a multi-locus approach when studying this important marine resource, including research on food quality and safety, sustainable production and conservation.","Larraín, M.A.; González, P.; Pérez, C.; Araneda, C.",WOS:000508904100023,"Araneda, Cristian, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-019-55855-8,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Quim & Farmaceut, Dept Ciencia Alimentos & Tecnol Quim, Santiago, Chile.",Chile,,DOUBLY UNIPARENTAL INHERITANCE; SMOOTH-SHELLED MUSSELS; CHILEAN BLUE MUSSEL; PCR-BASED NUCLEAR; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HYBRID ZONE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PACIFIC COAST; EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS; GALLOPROVINCIALIS LAMARCK,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Universidad de Chile - Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences - Department of Food Science and technology,x,Chile,,University,Science

However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can ‘disentangle’ trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1–4 mm) and large (>4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses.","McLaverty, C.; Eigaard, O.R.; Gislason, H.; Bastardie, F.; Brooks, M.E.; Jonsson, P.; Lehmann, A.; Dinesen, G.E.",WOS:000507381800008,"McLaverty, Ciarán, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105811,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Benthic community; Benthic indicators; Ecosystem-based approach; Fisheries management; Functional traits; Seafloor disturbance; Trawling impacts,Journal article,,,"Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Bldg 201,Room 049, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",Denmark,Benthic community; Benthic indicators; Ecosystem-based approach; Fisheries management; Functional traits; Seafloor disturbance; Trawling impacts,FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; LONG-TERM; INFAUNAL COMMUNITY; GLOBAL ANALYSIS; BALTIC SEA; SIZE; KATTEGAT; FISHERY; IMPACTS; MODEL,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Major oscillations thus far detected are Atlantic Multi‐decadal Oscillation, Pacific Multi‐decadal Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Dipole, Antarctic Oscillation, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. In the multi‐decadal, inter‐decadal and decadal time scales, the effects of climate variability over the hydrological processes that interconnect the Amazon and La Plata watersheds are felt predominantly in the South American Monsoon season, while on the inter‐annual scale the effects vary along the year. The hydrological memory in Amazonian soils is also responsible for the inter‐annual variability of hydrology of the Amazon Basin. Due to the effects of soil water on evapotranspiration, the hydrological memory can affect the supply of moisture to the La Plata Basin, influencing the inter‐annual variability of this basin. The implications of the observed oscillations to the hydrological and climatological variability in the two basins are discussed and synthesized in this article.

Decades of policy initiatives to reduce external (land-based and atmospheric) nutrient loads have so far failed to control Baltic Sea eutrophication, which is compounded by significant internal release of legacy phosphorus (P) and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Farming and harvesting of the native mussel species (<i>Mytilus edulis/trossulus</i>) is a promising internal measure for eutrophication control in the brackish Baltic Sea. Mussels from the more saline outer Baltic had higher N and P content than those from either the inner or central Baltic. Despite their relatively low nutrient content, harvesting farmed mussels from the central Baltic can be a cost-effective complement to land-based measures needed to reach eutrophication status targets and is an important contributor to circularity. Cost effectiveness of nutrient removal is more dependent on farm type than mussel nutrient content, suggesting the need for additional development of farm technology. Furthermore, current regulations are not sufficiently conducive to implementation of internal measures, and may constitute a bottleneck for reaching eutrophication status targets in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere.","Kotta, Jonne; Futter, Martyn; Kaasik, Ants; Liversage, Kiran; Rätsep, Merli; Barboza, Francisco R.; Bergström, Lena; Bergström, Per; Bobsien, Ivo; Díaz, Eliecer; Herkül, Kristjan; Jonsson, Per R.; Korpinen, Samuli; Kraufvelin, Patrik; Krost, Peter; Lindahl, Odd; Lindegarth, Mats; Lyngsgaard, Maren Moltke; Mühl, Martina; Sandman, Antonia Nyström; Orav-Kotta, Helen; Orlova, Marina; Skov, Henrik; Rissanen, Jouko; Šiaulys, Andrius; Vidakovic, Aleksandar; Virtanen, Elina",WOS:000512281700085,,,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136144,,"EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",Baltic,,Aquaculture,,Blue growth; Eutrophication control; Internal measures; Mussel farming,Journal article,,,"Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",Estonia,Aquaculture; Blue growth; Eutrophication control; Internal measures; Mussel farming; Baltic Sea,MYTILUS-EDULIS; WATER-QUALITY; FRESH-WATER; NITROGEN; ECOLOGY; CYCLE; FJORD; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; NUTRIENTS,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Marine shelled molluscs from two locations in the Maltese islands – a checklist. <i>Nat. Sicil. S. IV, XLIII(2)</i>: 239-252","Climate change and manifold other anthropogenic influences are the main driving factors for changes in marine ecosystems. Characterising these changes is of great interest and can be made possible through the adoption of marine shelled mollusca as bioindicators. Malta is renowned for its rich diversity of mollusc species, including rare and endemic ones. So, we analysed mollusc shell grit from two locations (St. Pauls Island/Selmunett Island and Marsaxlokk) to provide a species baseline list for future investigations. We identified a total of 7662 parts of marine shelled mollusca. 115 species were found at St. Pauls Island and 45 species at Marsaxlokk, belonging to a total of 60 families (16 at both locations). To make both samples comparable, despite differences in sampling efforts, we formulated an individual-based species extrapolation curve for each location. With this, we calculated an estimated total species number of 134 at St. Pauls Island and of 49 at Marsaxlokk, for a set threshold of 6000 individuals, indicating a considerably lower mollusc diversity at the second location, putatively the result of higher human disturbance levels at the same location. The substantial differences in mollusc species composition between the two localities, despite the small geographical distance between the two, further underscores the importance of further related research.","Wölfling, M.; Uhl, B.; Sciberras, A.; Deidun, A.",,"Wölfling, Mirko, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,,"Biodiversity, ""Community composition"", ""Species richness""",,"microshells, species inventory",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study leads to the identification of the Ecological Quality status of benthic habitats based on a one-year survey (2013–2014) underneath and near the cages as well as in non-impacted areas lying outside the influence of salmon farming. The semi-diurnal high tide regime of the Rade de Cherbourg (5 to 8 m tidal range from neap to spring tide) should prevent any significant accumulation of Organic Matter (OM) under the cages. Nevertheless, higher Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and the presence of opportunistic species at sampling stations under and near the cages indicate an impact of salmon farming on the benthic habitats. Three benthic assemblages are identified, corresponding to three sediment types with different levels of OM enrichment. The presence of several indicator species, such as the polychaete worm <i>Capitella minima</i> belonging to the Capitellidae, reflects the local impact of fish farming without long-term accumulation of OM in the shallow waters of the RdC. Moreover, one of the main characteristics of the macrofauna of the RdC and neighbouring zones is the current very high abundance and dominance of the tanaid <i>Apseudopsis latreillii</i> in diverse sediment types. Benthic indices (AMBI, M-AMBI, and BO2A) were also able to distinguish three main zones in relation to the distance to salmon cages.","Dauvin, J.C.; Pezy, J.-P.; Baffreau, A.; Bachelet, Q.; Baux, N.; Mear, Y.; Murat, A.; Poizot, E.",WOS:000510424900046,"Baffreau, Alexandrine, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734832,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Macrobenthic communities; Sediment characteristics; Salmon fish farm; Benthic indices; TOC enrichment,Journal article,,,"Univ Caen Normandie, UNICAEN, Lab Morphodynam Continentale & Cotiere, UMR CNRS M2C 6143, 24 Rue Tilleuls, F-14000 Caen, France.",France,Macrobenthic communities; Sediment characteristics; Salmon fish farm; Benthic indices; TOC enrichment,FLUSHED MARINE SITE; ATLANTIC SALMON; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY; POLYCHAETE/AMPHIPOD RATIOS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; BIOTIC INDEXES; AQUACULTURE; BAY; COMMUNITY,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Joint Research Unit: M2C Morphodynamique Continentale et Côtière (UMR 6143),x,France,,Research network,Science

Biological factors such as competition, predation, and recruitment can also exert control on the structure of hard bottom communities. Community composition and recovery were measured at three sites on a nearshore hard bottom community in Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Seasonality and recovery of macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were evaluated at a frequency that would allow for an effective assessment of temporal change over a consecutive 16 months (24 May 2016 to 15 Sep 2017). Temporal communities were designated by grouping consecutive sampling days that did not differ (p ≥ .05). Community composition was significantly different between established temporal communities and sites (p < .001). Recovery within experimentally disturbed quadrats differed from corresponding controls depending on the state of the community before the disturbance. Specific taxa were identified as ‘important’ in differentiating temporal communities and sites for community composition. Seasonal temperature changes help explain the temporal patterns, and patchiness can justify the spatial variation. The transition through temporal communities can be related to consistent physical environmental factors, like temperature, but disturbances can introduce variability.","LaCroce, M.E.; Long, Z.T.; Freshwater, D.W.",WOS:000514018900003,"Freshwater, D.

The identification of invasive NNS is already established, those that may arrive in the future, their vectors and pathways of introduction and spread, and hotspots of invasion are important for a targeted approach to managing introductions and impacts at local, regional and global scales. The aim of this study was to identify which marine and brackish NNS are already present in marine systems of the northeastern Arabia area (Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman) and of these which ones are potentially invasive, and which species have a high likelihood of being introduced in the future and negatively affect biodiversity. Overall, 136 NNS were identified, of which 56 are already present in the region and a further 80 were identified as likely to arrive in the future, including fish, tunicates, invertebrates, plants and protists. The Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS‐ISK) was used to identify the risk of NNS being (or becoming) invasive within the region. Based on the AS‐ISK basic risk assessment (BRA) thresholds, 36 extant and 37 horizon species (53.7% of all species) were identified as high risk. When the impact of climate change on the overall assessment was considered, the combined risk score (BRA+CCA) increased for 38.2% of all species, suggesting higher risk under warmer conditions, including the highest‐risk horizon NNS the green crab <i>Carcinus maenas</i>, and the extant macro‐alga <i>Hypnea musciformis</i>. This is the first horizon‐scanning exercise for NNS in the region, thus providing a vital baseline for future management. The outcome of this study is the prioritization of NNS to inform decision‐making for the targeted monitoring and management in the region to prevent new bio‐invasions and to control existing species, including their potential for spread.","Clarke, S.A.; Vilizzi, L.; Lee, L.; Wood, L.E.; Cowie, W.J.; Burt, J.A.; Mamiit, R.J.E.; Ali, H.; Davison, P.I.; Fenwick, G.V.; Harmer, R.; Skóra, M.E.; Kozic, S.; Aislabie, L.R.; Kennerley, A.; Le Quesne, W.J.F.; Copp, G.H.; Stebbing, P.D.",WOS:000510779500001,"Clarke, Stacey, S.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/gcb.14964,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.",England,AS-ISK; extant non-native species; horizon species; risk screening; ROPME,HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CARCINUS-MAENAS; MANAGEMENT; FISHES; RISK; IDENTIFICATION; IMPACTS; TURTLE; RIVER,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)",,,,,

We hypothesised that structural differences in community composition would be reflected in food web complexity and that resource partitioning could be one of the mechanisms contributing to the co-existence of such dense communities. Sampling was conducted at a gravity-based foundation in the Belgian part of the North Sea, where both sessile and mobile organisms were collected along the depth gradient of the turbine, the SPL and the surrounding soft substrate. The results indicated that the structural differences of the communities are reflected in the food web complexity as indicated by the trophic niche size, the trophic diversity and the redundancy of the communities along the depth gradient. Higher food web complexity was associated with zones where high accumulation of organic matter occurs (soft substrate and SPL). Low food web complexity was observed in depth zones that are dominated by sessile suspension-feeding organisms (intertidal and <i>Mytilus</i> zone). The high trophic diversity and low redundancy observed within the trophic clusters of the soft substrate and the <i>Metridium</i> zone indicated that resource partitioning can be a mechanism allowing the co-existence of large densities of a wide variety of species.","Mavraki, N.; Degraer, S.; Moens, T.; Vanaverbeke, J.",WOS:000528613500005,"Mavraki, Ninon, N.","Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Operational Directorate Natural Environment, Marine Ecology and Management",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104868,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Fouling organisms, ""Offshore structures""",,Habitat complexity; Resource partitioning; Stable isotopes; Trophic niche,Journal article,,,"Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Marine Ecol & Management, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Belgium,Fouling organisms; Habitat complexity; Offshore structures; Resource partitioning; Stable isotopes; Trophic niche,FOOD-WEB; LANICE-CONCHILEGA; RATIOS; NICHE; CARBON; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; MACROFAUNA; SEDIMENTS; ECOSYSTEM,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,,,,,,

This article presents an analytical review of the available literature data concerning the knowledge of freshwater molluscs fauna of the Transcarpathian region. The list of all species of freshwater molluscs (gastropods and bivalves) that were observed or have been collected by different authors in the territory during the 19-21 centuries is presented. Altogether the list contains 86 species of freshwater gastropods from 13 families and 33 species of bivalves, which belong to 2 families. One species, Viviparus rossmaessleri (Bourguignat, 1880) is only indicated as a possible resident of the area. Status of other species that are mentioned in the analyzed literature require further clarification, as in species of independence, and about the real presence of them in the area. The presence of some of them was confirmed as a result of our revisions of the malacological collections of natural institutions of Ukraine. A significant number of names (species) are listed in this article, by a modern classification (World Register of Marine Species), reduced to synonyms, common species, so such a taxa number, which is indicated in the literature, in our opinion, is overestimated. In this article we do not aim to reduce this list, but only based on literature data, showing the general picture of the composition of the molluscs fauna of this region. Our further work will be aimed at the systematic study of the freshwater molluscs fauna of the Transcarpathian region, based on our own sampling from this area that were carried out during the years 2016-2019.

Among these coral reefs, octocorals are common members of invertebrate reef fauna. The ecological importance of octocorals can be seen through their use as microhabitats by marine vertebrates and invertebrates (e.g., shrimp, fish, ovulids); acting as important spawning, nursery, breeding and feeding areas for a variety of other organisms, and additionally providing refuge from predators. Therefore, their three-dimensional structures contribute to the structural complexity and biodiversity of reefs, facilitating niche diversification, and speciation. Despite their importance to reef ecology and biodiversity, octocorals have received relatively little attention, compared to other anthozoan groups such as scleractinian corals, and thus remain a poorly known and little-studied group. However, as their abundances increase due to the decline of scleractinian corals worldwide, octocorals are likely to play a growing role in future reefs. The purpose of this review is thus to gather existing knowledge on their biology, ecology and societal importance in order to provide a comprehensive information source for future research efforts.","Lau, Y.W.; Poliseno, A.; Kushida, Y.; Quéré, G.; Reimer, J.D.",,"Quéré, Gaëlle, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-409548-9.12109-8,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Octocorallia,"Biodiversity, ""Symbiosis"", ""Systematics"", ""Taxonomy""",,Gorgonians; Molecular phylogenetics; Sea pens; Soft corals; ,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the efficiency of two types of sampling gears (camera-epibenthic sled – C-EBS and giant box corer – BC) for species richness assessment of Tanaidacea in the abyssal plain of the region of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench. In terms of species richness small, benthic, brooding tanaidaceans are amongst the most highly underestimated groups of the deep-sea macrofauna and can be treated as a model group for such a study. Large numbers of singletons and doubletons (25% of species in BC, 24% of species in C-EBS) together with steep species accumulation curves suggest substantial undersampling. The total number of species and the number of unique species collected by each gear was higher in the C-EBS (77 and 44 species respectively) than in the BC (46 and 11 species respectively) but those differences seem to be low taking into account the total sampled area (5.75 m<sup>2</sup> of seafloor for BC, and 53,709 m2 for C-EBS). Thirty-three species were collected with both gears. Therefore, efficiency of the point sampler (BC) was very high. The comparison of replicability (2 replicate stations per site) showed that only 13–60% (BC) and 22–58% (C-EBS) of species recorded at any given site can be found in both replicates, suggesting a highly patchy distribution of abyssal tanaidaceans. On the other hand many species were recorded in more than ten samples (both in BC and C-EBS). Our results indicate important gear-specific problems suggesting that it would be difficult to say if observed patterns (e.g., the level of patchiness or rarity of a particular species) are true or caused by sampling artefacts.","Józwiak, P.; Pabis, K.; Brandt, A.; Blazewicz, M.",WOS:000512481200017,"Józwiak, Piotr, P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102255,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biodiversity, ""Deep sea"", ""Patchiness""",Western pacific,Sampling gear; Sampling efficiency; Rarity; Western Pacific; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench,Journal article,,,"Univ Lodz, Lab Polar Biol & Oceanobiol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90238 Lodz, Poland.",Poland,Sampling gear; Biodiversity; Deep sea; Sampling efficiency; Patchiness; Rarity; Western Pacific; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench,1ST INSIGHTS; DEEP; SEA; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; CRUSTACEA; CAMERA; PERACARIDA; TRAWL; FAUNA,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Lodz,x,Poland,,University,Science

Terebrids are abundant, easily recognizable and widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters, but our findings have demonstrated that their systematics requires revision. Here we elaborate the classification of Terebridae based on a recently published molecular phylogeny of 154 species, plus characters of the shell and anterior alimentary system. The 407 living species of the family, including seven species described herein, are assigned to three subfamilies: Pellifroniinae new subfamily, Pervicaciinae and Terebrinae. The Pellifroniinae comprises five deep-water species in two genera, <i>Pellifronia</i> and <i>Bathyterebra</i> n. gen. Pellifroniinae possess a radula of duplex marginal teeth, well-developed proboscis and venom gland, and a very small rhynchodeal introvert. The Pervicaciinae includes c. 50 species in the predominantly Indo-Pacific genera <i>Duplicaria</i> and <i>Partecosta</i>. Pervicaciinae possess salivary glands, a radula of solid recurved marginal teeth and a weakly developed rhynchodeal introvert, but lack proboscis and venom gland. The remaining Terebridae species are classified into 15 genera in the subfamily Terebrinae (including four genera described herein); nine genera are defined on the basis of phylogenetic data and six solely on shell morphology. The Indo-Pacific genera Profunditerebra n. gen., Maculauger n. gen. and <i>Myurellopsis</i> n. gen. each include about a dozen species. The first is restricted to the deep waters of the Indo-West Pacific, while the latter two range widely in both geographic and bathymetric distribution. <i>Neoterebra</i> n. gen. encompasses about 65 species from a range of localities in the eastern Pacific, Caribbean, and Atlantic, and from varying depths. To characterize the highly diversified genera <i>Terebra, Punctoterebra, Myurella</i> and <i>Duplicaria</i>, each of which comprise several morphological clusters, we propose the use of DNA-based diagnoses. These diagnoses are combined with more informative descriptions to define most of the supraspecific taxa of Terebridae, to provide a comprehensive revision of the group.","Fedosov, A.E.; Malcolm, G.; Terryn, Y.; Gorson, J.; Modica, M.V.; Holford, M.; Puillandre, N.",WOS:000515118500001,"Modica, Maria Vittoria, M.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyz004,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Antilles, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS,Sorbonne Univ,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 26, F-75005 Paris, France.",France,,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; SNAILS GASTROPODA; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; FOREGUT; ANATOMY; HISTORY,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,,,,,,

Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Ghent University: Gent. xiii, 78 pp.","To date, the majority of research focuses on the extraction of certain temporal and frequency characteristics from the spectrogram of the bat echolocation call to classify bat species. The downside of this method is the loss of information about the shape of the bat call and the inability to classify the more complex social calls of bats. Tied to this is the process of identifying the bat calls in the audio recordings and extracting the features; two important steps, but often neglected in current research. Therefore, this article presents a method to fully automate the classification of bat species at the Belgian coast from audio recordings. The accomplish this, the calls were detected in the audio files with the recent BatDetective convolutional neural network (CNN) [1]. Different image segmentation techniques were then tried to denoise the spectrogram of the call. Three sets of features, including the call characteristics, a fitted curve through the call and the image of the spectrogram, were extracted from the denoised spectrogram. Finally, a variety of models, both supervised and unsupervised were tested on these features and compared. The final method denoises the spectrogram using a combination of background removal, global thresholding and region growing. Only when high intensity echos are present, the method does not fully denoise the spectrogram. The best classification performance was achieved with the pretrained VGG16 [2] model, trained on the images of the spectrogram. In particular when adding reference lines at fixed frequencies in the image the CNN outperformed all other methods by a large margin. This indicates that other methods, apart form extracting the call characteristics, should be considered in classifying bat species.","Fojtek, C.",,"Fojtek, Christian, C.","Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Ghent University",,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",Belgian Coast,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Engineering and Architecture,,Belgium,x,University,Science

Extinction risk is most rigorously assessed using quantitative data on species’ population trajectories, but in the absence of such data, assessments often rely on qualitative estimates based on expert opinion of species abundances, distributions and threats. For example, one-third of coral species are classified as threatened and another third as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, despite a lack of data at the population level for the vast majority of species. Since many taxa show a strong correlation between species traits and extinction risk, an alternate approach is to identify traits associated with extinction in other groups and apply them to the taxon of interest. Here, we examine whether life-history traits associated with stress tolerance, fecundity and habitat specialisation are correlated with Red List conservation status in reef corals. We found no relationship between conservation status and life-history traits, suggesting that either traits identified as important predictors of extinction risk in other taxa are not important in corals, or that conservation status does not accurately reflect species’ relative extinction risk. Therefore, using global-scale extinction risk assessments to inform conservation of coral reefs presents a high risk of ‘silent extinctions’ of undescribed species. We argue that the conservation status for the vast majority of coral species should be ‘data deficient’ and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, and that the status and trends of coral populations can only be reliably assessed at relatively small scales.","Bridge, T.C.L.; Luiz, O.J.; Kuo, C.-Y.; Precoda, K.; Madin, E.M.P.; Madin, J.S.; Baird, A.H.",WOS:000505425900001,"Kuo, Chao-Yang, C.-Y.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00338-019-01885-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Queensland Museum, Biodivers & Geosci Program, Museum Trop Queensland, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.",Australia,Coral reefs; Scleractinia; Red List; Biodiversity; Boosted regression trees; Taxonomy; Conservation; Management,EXTINCTION RISK; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BUILDING CORALS; SCLERACTINIA; SELECTIVITY; PATTERNS; CNIDARIA; DEPTH,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Queensland Museum - Biodiversity & Geosciences collections,x,Australia,,Museum,Science

Depending on the microenvironment stimuli, macrophages can acquire distinct phenotypes characterized with different sets of the markers of their functional activities. Polarization of macrophages towards M1 type (classical activation) is involved in inflammation and the related progression of diseases, while, in contrast, alternatively activated M2 macrophages are associated with the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Reprogramming macrophages to switch their phenotypes could provide a new therapeutic strategy, and targeting the M1/M2 macrophage balance is a promising current trend in pharmacology. Marine invertebrates are a vast source of the variety of structurally diverse compounds with potent pharmacological activities. For years, a large number of studies concerning the immunomodulatory properties of the marine substances have been run with using some intracellular markers of immune stimulation or suppression irrespective of the possible application of marine compounds in reprogramming of macrophage activation, and only few reports clearly demonstrated the macrophage-polarizing activities of some marine compounds during the last decade.

Specimens were identified by external morphological shell and gill characteristics, by the colour of the foot, mantle fringe and radular characteristics. Ecological aspects like habitat preference were also used to distinguish species. Existing diagnostic characters were amended with newer characteristics emerged in our study. Seven species from two families, Nacellidae and Lottiidae, were found along the mainland Indian coastline. Each species is present with several polymorphic forms with different colour banding patterns. Our study revealed distinct variations in the radular teeth at the genus level, but less differences within genera.

As no ship wreck was found in the vicinity, the reason of the presence of these amphora fragments, whose faces present a large accumulation of oyster shells, is unknown. Reconstructed geomorphological maps of the area present Mermian as a riverine site already at this period, and several hypothetical explanations on the role of these amphorae exist (landfill linked to a neighbouring habitat, bank reinforcement linked to a ford crossing, river landing, etc.). In order to define whether the amphorae were transported to this location and from where, we analysed the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of the oyster shells. The δ13C and δ18O indicate that all oysters lived in the same environment, refuting a potential transport during the oyster accumulation. Moreover, the analysis of Mytilaster sp. shells in the sediment around the oyster shells also reported a marine origin, suggesting that these oysters were also buried in a marine deposit. Transport to Mermian from a coastal locality is unlikely but may still have happened, although no trace of human handling were observed on the fragments. Still, the presence of other marine or brackish molluscs in the sediment discards the interpretation of Mermian being a continental locality.","Mouchi, V.; Emmanuel, L.; Forest, V.; Rivalan, A.",,"Emmanuel, Laurent, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5334/oq.65,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Ostrea edulis,Archaeology,,"oyster shell, stable isotope, biomineralisation, Mermian",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the reference database of DNA barcode sequences is particularly sparsely populated for marine invertebrates and for tropical taxa. We used samples collected as part of two field courses, focused on graduate training in taxonomy and systematics, to generate DNA sequences of the barcode fragments of <i>cytochrome</i> c <i>oxidase</i> subunit I (COI) and mitochondrial ribosomal 16S genes for 447 individuals, representing at least 129 morphospecies of decapod crustaceans. COI sequences for 36% (51/140) of the species and 16S sequences for 26% (37/140) of the species were new to GenBank. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery identified 140 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which largely coincided with the morphospecies delimitations. Barcode identifications (i.e. matches to identified sequences) were especially useful for OTUs within <i>Synalpheus</i>, a group that is notoriously difficult to identify and rife with cryptic species, a number of which we could not identify to species, based on morphology. Non-concordance between morphospecies and barcode OTUs also occurred in a few cases of suspected cryptic species. As mitochondrial pseudogenes are particularly common in decapods, we investigate the potential for this dataset to include pseudogenes and discuss the utility of these sequences as species identifiers (i.e. barcodes). These results demonstrate that material collected and identified during training activities can provide useful incidental barcode reference samples for under-studied taxa.","Venera-Pontón, D.E.; Driskell, A.C.; De Grave, S.; Felder, D.L.; Scioli, J.; Collin, R.",WOS:000506886700001,"Scioli, Justin, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3897/bdj.8.e47333,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Panama,,,,"cytochrome c oxidase I, Panama, Bocas del Toro, shrimps, crabs",Journal article,,,"Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.",USA,cytochrome c oxidase I; Panama; Bocas del Toro; shrimps; crabs,BOCAS-DEL-TORO; NUCLEAR MITOCHONDRIAL PSEUDOGENES; SNAPPING SHRIMPS; BIOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATIONS; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; CRUSTACEA; ALPHEIDAE; GENUS; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS,Biodiversity Conservation,Biodiversity & Conservation,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,x,USA,,University,Science

Since the 1970s, both increases and decreases in phytoplankton biomass and production have been reported from different parts of the North Sea. Such conflicting observations may be partly caused by methodological differences, but also reflect regional differences related to bathymetry, hydrodynamics, climate, riverine and Atlantic influence. The Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) is a hydrodynamically and bathymetrically complex area under strong human influence, which has been characterized by eutrophication (up to the 1980s) and de-eutrophication (1990s onwards), and pronounced long-term changes in turbidity and water temperature. We used a newly recovered and standardized historic dataset, the Belgian Phytoplankton Database (Nohe et al., 2018), to compare the biomass, composition and seasonality of diatom and dinoflagellate assemblages, two key components of the plankton in the BPNS, between the 1970s and 2000s. Diatoms, especially large-sized taxa, showed an increase from late winter to summer, resulting in a more intense and extended growing season in the 2000s. Dinoflagellates increased year-round but especially in summer. Both diatom and dinoflagellate blooms showed a clear shift towards an earlier bloom start. In addition, while in the 1970s distinct seasonal community types were present, a striking seasonal homogenization in community structure had occurred by the 2000s. Finally, we observed a pronounced increase in the abundance of harmful diatom and dinoflagellate genera. The observed changes are most likely due to an increase in sea surface temperature and water transparency, and changes in nutrient loads and ratios. Our study underscores the importance of recovering previously inaccessible historic data as they can offer unprecedented insights into long-term change in marine ecosystems, which are essential for properly evaluating the impact of human activities on these ecosystems.","Nohe, A.; Goffin, A.; Tyberghein, L.; Lagring, R.; De Cauwer, K.; Vyverman, W.; Sabbe, K.",WOS:000519987300098,"Tyberghein, Lennert, L.",Flanders Marine Institute,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136316,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Marine Data Archeology""",Belgium,,"Diatoms, ""Dinoflagellates"", ""Long-term changes"", ""Phytoplankton""",,Belgian part of the North Sea,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Lab Protistol & Aquat Ecol, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Phytoplankton; Diatoms; Dinoflagellates; Belgian part of the North Sea; Long-term changes,LONG-TERM CHANGES; EASTERN ENGLISH-CHANNEL; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL WATERS; SOUTHERN BIGHT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; OCEAN,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),,,,,

Here we compiled data for over 67,000 marine and terrestrial species and used artificial neural networks to model species richness with the state and variability of climate, productivity, and multiple other environmental variables. We find terrestrial diversity is better predicted by the available environmental drivers than is marine diversity, and that marine diversity can be predicted with a smaller set of variables. Ecological mechanisms such as geographic isolation and structural complexity appear to explain model residuals and also identify regions and processes that deserve further attention at the global scale. Improving estimates of the relationships between the patterns of global biodiversity, and the environmental mechanisms that support them, should help in efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change and provide guidance for adapting to life in the Anthropocene.","Gagne, T.O.; Reygondeau, G.; Jenkins, C.N.; Sexton, J.O.; Bograd, S.J.; Hazen, E.L.; Van Houtan, K.S.",WOS:000534621500033,"Sexton, Joseph, J.O.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0228065,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",USA,,SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; PATTERNS; MODELS; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; GRADIENTS; RICHNESS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Duke University,,USA,,University,Science

Many commonalities exist in the morphology of deep and shallow-water sea urchins, but different evolutionary histories and adaptations to living at great depths have created peculiar and divergent morphologies within deep-sea sea urchins. These are highlighted alongside a list of families prevalent and charismatic in the deep sea. Following this brief introduction, life-history traits (growth and reproduction) and nutrition, including food sources, trophic positioning, nutrient partitioning, seasonal dietary shifts, and bioerosion of deep-sea corals are discussed in detail. The majority of deep-sea sea urchins appears to be deposit feeders and scavengers, but some exceptions indicate more sophisticated diets comprised of predation on living coral and highly mobile invertebrates. Our understanding of adaptations to cope with food restrictions and competitive interactions in the deep sea is still limited. However, we do know that growth and reproduction may be coupled to the influx of surface-derived phytodetritus, which heavily influences growth of all taxa and reproduction of seasonal breeders. Known patterns in distribution, abundance, and habitat associations, as well as deep-sea sea urchin interaction with predators, competitors, and symbionts are outlined. The chapter concludes with the evolutionary history of deep-sea fauna, focusing on sea urchin diversity.","Stevenson, A.; Kroh, A.",,"Kroh, Andreas, A.","Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Dept Geol & Palaeontol, Burgring 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/b978-0-12-819570-3.00014-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Aspidodiadematidae, ""Cidaridae"", ""Echinidae"", ""Echinothuriidae"", ""Holasteroida"", ""Pedinidae""",Bioerosion,,Extreme morphologies; Phytodetritus; ,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,Museum of Natural History Vienna - Department of Geology & Palaeontology,x,Austria,,Museum,Science

Systems modelling, lognormal analysis, diversity indices and relevant methods of investigation provided an opportunity of details quantified description of succession process. The results defined time-span of colonization (primary) and recovery (after hypoxic event) community structure (secondary), community structure. Thereafter, while observing succession development, structure changes are related to particular stage, and the roles of disturbances are discussed.

These radiations are abundant on oceanic islands and in ancient freshwater lakes, but rare in marine habitats. This contrast is well documented in the Hawaiian Archipelago, where terrestrial examples include the speciose silverswords (sunflower family Asteraceae), Drosophila fruit flies, and honeycreepers (passerine birds), all derived from one or a few ancestral lineages. The marine fauna of Hawaiʻi is also the product of rare colonization events, but these colonizations usually yield only one species. Dispersal ability is key to understanding this evolutionary inequity. While terrestrial fauna rarely colonize between oceanic islands, marine fauna with pelagic larvae can make this leap in every generation. An informative exception is the marine fauna that lack a pelagic larval stage. These low-dispersal species emulate a “terrestrial” mode of reproduction (brooding, viviparity, crawl-away larvae), yielding marine species flocks in scattered locations around the world. Elsewhere, aquatic species flocks are concentrated in specific geographic settings, including the ancient lakes of Baikal (Siberia) and Tanganyika (eastern Africa), and Antarctica. These locations host multiple species flocks across a broad taxonomic spectrum, indicating a unifying evolutionary phenomenon. Hence marine species flocks can be singular cases that arise due to restricted dispersal or other intrinsic features, or they can be geographically clustered, promoted by extrinsic ecological circumstances. Here, we review and contrast intrinsic cases of species flocks in individual taxa, and extrinsic cases of geological/ecological opportunity, to elucidate the processes of species radiations.","Bowen, B.W.; Forsman, Z.H.; Whitney, J.L.; Faucci, A.; Hoban, M.; Canfield, S.J.; Johnston, E.C.; Coleman, R.R.; Copus, J.M.; Vicente, J.; Toonen, R.J.",WOS:000515118600006,"Faucci, Anuschka, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/jhered/esz075,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"ancient lakes, dispersal, endemism, monophyly, oceanic islands, sympatric speciation",Journal article,,,"Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",USA,ancient lakes; dispersal; endemism; monophyly; oceanic islands; sympatric speciation,FISHES GLOBAL PATTERNS; LAKE BAIKAL; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; CORAL-REEF; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; INCIPIENT SPECIATION; EXPLOSIVE RADIATION; CRYPTIC SPECIATION,Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,,,,,,

Most recent work has been on the bathyal fauna (i.e. 1,000m-2,999 m depth), with virtually nothing on the abyssal fauna (i.e. deeper than 3,000 m). The one study on hydrothermal vent digeneans has indicated that these regions probably harbour a distinctive fauna. The demarcation of the deep-sea fauna is blurred at the poles, where the cold-adapted fauna appears similar to the shallower bathyal fauna. The abyssal fauna, however, appears distinct, possibly due to adaptations to variable or ultra-high pressures. The digenean fauna of bathypelagic fishes is depauperate. Recent phylogenetic studies reinforce the view that the typical deep-sea fauna has radiated in the deep-sea. Encroachment into the deep from shallow water is relatively rare. Overall, the digenean fauna in the deep-sea is distinctly less diverse that the equivalent fauna in shallow waters. A major conclusion is that our understanding of the deep-sea digenean fauna is poor, and that much further work over a much wider area is needed.","Bray, R.A.",WOS:000580864300038,"Bray, Rodney, R.A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.01.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Digenea,Deep sea,,"Teleosts, Abyss, Bathyal, Diversity",Journal article,,,"Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",England,Deep-sea; Digenea; Teleosts; Abyss; Bathyal; Diversity,N.-SP DIGENEA; SOUTH-EASTERN PACIFIC; MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE; RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; MORA-MORO RISSO; GULF-OF-MEXICO; OPECOELIDAE PLAGIOPORINAE; LIFE-CYCLE; LEPOCREADIIDAE DIGENEA; GADIFORM FISHES,Ecology; Parasitology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Parasitology,Natural History Museum (NHM),,,,,

Information contributed by the palynological and anthracological studies indicates that this transition was marked by a steady expansion of broadleaf woodland and a reduction in herbaceous-shrub communities. Archaeofaunal studies reveal continuity in subsistence strategies throughout the sequence. This was based on specialisation in hunting red deer, fishing, and gathering molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderm species on rocky shores. The difference between the Azilian and Mesolithic occupations lies in the replacement of some marine invertebrate species and the decrease in limpet sizes.

Palynomorphs are abundant and well-preserved (~400–21,900 ind./g; average 5730 ind./g), comprising acritarchs, zoomorphs (invertebrate eggs, egg capsules, mouthparts), foraminiferal linings, tintinnid loricae, ciliate cysts, and freshwater algae. Acritarch P and <i>Halodinium minor</i> were the most abundant and widely distributed acritarchs (avg. ~410 and ~340 ind./g, respectively). Invertebrate eggs (avg. ~570 ind./g) and foraminiferal linings (avg. ~1600 ind./g) were prominent. Six tintinnid forms were identified, cf. <i>Parafavella parumdentata</i> (avg. ~40 ind./g; 10 stations) showing the widest distribution. Ciliate cysts included <i>Strombidium</i>? cyst A, a spherical, flask-shaped cell with short spines and a rounded base (avg. ~120 ind./g; 16 stations). <i>Pediastrum</i> sp. (avg. ~140 ind./g) and <i>Botryococcus</i> sp. (avg. ~1040 ind./g) were especially abundant in the west, likely delivered via rivers. Out of 14 environmental parameters only sedimentary biogenic silica (%Si(opal)) was significant in explaining palynomorph variation. At group level, tinitinnids showed the strongest positive correlation to %Si(opal). Individually, the tintinnid <i>Acanthostomella</i>? sp. 1, ciliate cyst <i>Fusopsis</i>? cyst A, and the acritarch <i>Palaeostomocystis fritilla</i> were almost solely and positively explained by %Si(opal). This suggests that %Si(opal) strongly determines palynomorph variability, particularly for microzooplankton, implying that siliceous organisms (diatoms) play an important role in shaping palynomorph content in the sedimentary record. Our data suggest that palynomorphs represent a valuable addition to organic-walled microfossils (dinocysts) routinely used in this region, offering a unique multiproxy glimpse into the ecosystem.","Pienkowski, A.J.; Kennaway, S.; Lang, S.I.",WOS:000528062400001,"Kennaway, Siôn, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marmicro.2020.101825,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Acritarchs; Tintinnids; Foraminiferal linings; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; Microfossils; Proxies; Non-pollen palynomorph (NPP),Journal article,,,"Norwegian Polar Res Inst, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway.",Norway,Acritarchs; Tintinnids; Foraminiferal linings; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; Microfossils; Proxies; Non-pollen palynomorph (NPP),NON-POLLEN PALYNOMORPHS; SEA-SURFACE CONDITIONS; DINOFLAGELLATE CYSTS; BEAUFORT SEA; FRESH-WATER; ARCTIC-OCEAN; HOLOCENE PALEOCEANOGRAPHY; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MEDITERRANEAN SEA,Paleontology,Paleontology,,,,,,

In the Arctic, benthic biogeographic patterns are additionally thought to be a result of the region’s glaciation history. Here, we investigate gross epibenthic biomass and assemblage structure turnover with water mass from coastal to bathyal depths from 136 beam trawl samples collected in the Beaufort Sea. We test whether Pacific Boreal Arctic species have their core distribution in shelf water masses while Atlantic Boreal Arctic species have wider depth ranges. Gross biomass estimates differed statistically among water masses, with high values mostly under the influences of the Polar Mixed Layer and Arctic Halocline (outer shelf and upper slope, respectively). Stations in the Coastal Zone and Canada Basin Deep Water had the lowest biomass. Epibenthic assemblages also differed significantly among water masses, with high taxon richness in shelf water masses that decreased considerably with depth. Biomass of benthic taxa with Pacific Boreal Arctic affinity was essentially limited to the shelf, while Atlantic Boreal Arctic taxa occurred across a broad depth range, though their biomass increased in deeper water masses for mollusks and echinoderms, but not for decapods/isopods. Our results confirm earlier evidence of a strong Atlantic-Arctic deep-water connectivity reaching into the Pacific Arctic region and suggest new arrivals of species from the boreal Pacific are likely to settle on Pacific Arctic shelves, but are unlikely to invade continental slope and basin waters in the foreseeable future.","Ravelo, A.M.; Bluhm, B.A.; Foster, N.R.; Iken, K.",WOS:000513578200001,"Foster, Nora, N.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-019-01036-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biogeography, ""Biomass"", ""Epibenthos""",,"Arctic, Epibenthos, Boreal Arctic taxa",Journal article,,,"Univ Alaska, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.",USA,Arctic; Epibenthos; Water mass; Biomass; Biogeography; Boreal Arctic taxa,FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ARCTIC BENTHOS; WATER MASS; ECHINODERMATA OPHIUROIDEA; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CANADA BASIN; CHUKCHI SEA; LAPTEV SEA,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Alaska Fairbanks,x,USA,,University,Science

Thus, marine Heterobranchia have recently become a major target for monitoring programs. For this work, an extensive survey was made in Bangka Archipelago, the first of its kind in this area. Bangka Archipelago is composed of small islands and the adjacent coastline of North Sulawesi. The substrate is dominated by biogenic reefs and volcanic rocks, thus forming highly diverse habitats. In total, 149 species were collected and/or photo-documented in September 2017 and September 2018, which represents the dry season. They can be assigned to the Cephalaspidea, Aplysiida, Pleurobranchida, Nudibranchia, and Eupulmonata. Thirty-three species are new to science, highlighting the lack of knowledge about the group and especially about this region. Our data provide a baseline for future monitoring surveys, as the anthropogenic pressures on Bangka Archipelago are increasing due to enhanced touristic activities, but also due to large scale environmental changes caused by previous mining operation activities.","Papu, A.; Undap, N.; Martinez, N.A.; Segre, M.R.; Galton Datang, I.; Kuada, R.R.; Perin, M.; Yonow, N.; Wägele, H.",WOS:000519115400028,"Papu, Adelfia, A.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/d12020052,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","Bangka, ""Sulawesi""",Heterobranchia,"Biodiversity, ""Monitoring""",,marine Heterobranchia; Bangka Island; North Sulawesi,Journal article,,,"Sam Ratulangi Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Manado 95115, Indonesia.",Indonesia,biodiversity; marine Heterobranchia; Bangka Island; North Sulawesi; monitoring,RUMPHIUS BIOHISTORICAL EXPEDITION; SEA SLUG ASSEMBLAGES; DORIDINA MOLLUSCA; NUDIBRANCHIA; OPISTHOBRANCHIA; PART; PATTERNS; TAXONOMY; GENUS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

By comparison, investments in offshore wind have been minor, limited until recently largely by perceptions of cost. Assimilated meteorological data are used here to assess future offshore wind potential for China. Analysis on a provincial basis indicates that the aggregate potential wind resource is 5.4 times larger than the current coastal demand for power. Recent experiences with markets in both Europe and the United States suggest that potential offshore resources in China could be exploited to cost-competitively provide 1148.3 TWh of energy in a high-cost scenario, 6383.4 TWh in a low-cost option, equivalent to between 36 and 200% of the total coastal energy demand after 2020. The analysis underscores notable benefits for offshore wind for China, with prospects for major reductions in greenhouse emissions with ancillary benefits for air quality.","Sherman, P.; Chen, X.; McElroy, M.",WOS:000514842000012,"Chen, Xinyu, X.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1126/sciadv.aax9571,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",USA,,POWER,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the vulnerability of 142 coastal Mediterranean MPAs to nine of the most invasive fishes under current and future climatic conditions. We predicted invasive species’ habitat suitability using an ensemble modelling approach, calibrating models on the entire distribution of the species. We categorized three risk levels for Mediterranean MPAs, based on the assumption that more suitable habitat conditions make protected areas more prone to invasion. Future projections forecasted an increase of suitable areas for all considered species in the Mediterranean basin. In the Levantine Sea, almost all MPAs are at high risk of invasion by the considered species both in the current and future scenarios. MPAs located in the other Mediterranean sectors have currently a low suitability for most invasive species, but their risk level will increase overall by 2050, especially in the South Adriatic Sea and off South Western Italy. By identifying spatial priorities in a global change context, we fill critical information gaps on the vulnerability of MPAs to the future expansion of warm-water invaders.","D’Amen, M.; Azzurro, E.",WOS:000518530200032,"D’Amen, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/icesjms/fsz207,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,"global change, invasion risk, invasive species, marine conservation, Mediterranean Sea, protected area network",Journal article,,,"Inst Environm Protect & Res, ISPRA, I-57122 Livorno, Italy.",Italy,global change; invasion risk; invasive species; marine conservation; Mediterranean Sea; protected area network,LIONFISH PTEROIS-MILES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SPECIES RICHNESS; SEA; CONSERVATION; RESERVES; IMPACTS; PLANT; BIODIVERSITY,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,,,,,,

Thousands of deep-sea coral records from the past 6 decades are compiled in the publicly accessible NOAA database, but few large-scale analyses of deep-sea coral biodiversity through time have been conducted. This study provides the longest temporal analysis of deep-sea coral generic biodiversity (58 yr), and the first such study for US waters. To mitigate missing temporal and spatial data, a machine learning model was employed to simulate deep-sea coral occurrences. Patterns of deep-sea coral generic biodiversity were calculated for observed and simulated data from 1960 to 2018 in the US marine ecoregions of the Gulf Stream Slope, Carolinian Atlantic Shelf and Slope, South Florida/Bahamian Atlantic Shelf and Slope, and Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) Shelf and Slope. There were statistically significant decreases in deep-sea coral generic biodiversity for all ecoregion/depth pairs in simulated data and most ecoregion/depth pairs in observed data. There was relative stability in biodiversity from 1960 to the mid-2000s, followed by generally rapid decreases between 2007 and 2011. Biodiversity stabilized after 2011, though it remains at the lowest average level in the past 58 yr. Most ecoregions and depths show the lowest generic richness during the most recent time interval (2010–2018) compared to the preceding 5 decades. The most persistent deep-sea coral genera from 1960 to 2018 vary based on ecoregion and depth. Rapid decreases in biodiversity support previous work showing deep-sea corals can undergo biodiversity loss in less than 4 yr, which is alarming given their slow growth and decadal recovery times. This analysis provides a robust temporal framework for future researchers to evaluate casual mechanisms affecting deep-sea coral biodiversity and inform on conservation strategies.","Zimmerman, A.N.; Johnson, C.C.; Bussberg, N.W.; Dalkilic, M.M.",WOS:000515694500001,"Zimmerman, Alexander, A.N.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s00338-020-01896-9,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""","Mexico Gulf, ""West Atlantic""",,,,"Deep-sea corals, Cold-water corals, Coral ecosystem, Ecoregions, NOAA, Machine learning, Random forest",Journal article,,,"Indiana Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",USA,Deep-sea corals; Cold-water corals; Coral ecosystem; Ecoregions; Gulf of Mexico; West Atlantic; NOAA; Machine learning; Random forest,LOPHELIA-PERTUSA; WATER CORALS; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; REEFS; LONGEVITY; BIOLOGY; GROWTH,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

Wave climate has been determined through an operational numerical model. A total of 121 taxa were recorded, gathered in three main faunal assemblages, as revealed by classification and ordination methods. Non-parametric multivariate multiple regression (distance-based linear model) showed that the variations in macrofaunal distribution can be explained by hydrodynamic conditions. Wave exposure strongly linked to estuarine inputs were the most relevant abiotic factors influencing distributional patterns and functional structure as described by biological traits analysis. Despite the influence of these abiotic variables affecting sedimentary dynamics, seasonal stability was observed in macrobenthic assemblages composition suggesting an ability to recover from natural disturbances such as (e.g.) winter storms.

Our studies have evidenced that the space-time dynamics of the geomorphological, environmental and trophic parameters have led the progression of Marinello ecosystem, favoring the onset of transient windows of connectivity (TWCs) between different habitats. TWCs, by supporting continuous re-arrangements of mollusc populations, have contributed to increase the functional and ecological complexity of the system. Salinity in particular has proven to be the most affecting factor on the diversification of mollusc assemblages, explaining 63% and 44% of variation for brackish and marine species respectively. In addition, the distribution of both detritus and suspension feeders has been mostly affected by salinity. The interannual analysis of the mollusc assemblages has shown in the whole system a generalised increase in the number of species, likewise, also the species richness recorded in each basin generally increased with the time. Metapopulations in the Marinello ecosystem have shown to be related to significant modifications in the habitat patches, in turn connected to the anthropogenic interventions or to the geomorphological progression of the entire physiographic system.

This research proposes that the individual growth pattern for jellyfish can be estimated in the absence of age readings through cohort follow-up over time and by multi-model inference approach (MMI). Length data were obtained during 2010–2011 in Gulf of California to obtain cohort information using a multinomial analysis and then assign age; growth model selection was based on MMI. Three cohorts were identified and the von Bertalanffy model suitably described their growth. The species has an accelerated growth with a short life cycle; cohorts one and two reached their asymptotic length, and the third one barely reached the length-at-first sexual maturity. Growth variations among cohorts could be explained by their different biological strategies where the first two prioritized asymptotic length and the third one reproduction length.

Using scanning electron microscopy and geometric morphometrics, the morphology of veliger larvae was compared. No significant differences were found between the shapes of the developing shell between the two species; however, it was found that <i>M. pilearis</i> was significantly larger than <i>M. parthenopeus</i> upon hatching.

Among the different components of marine life, the phylum Cnidaria (formerly Coelenterata)  has been reported to be responsible for more envenomations than any other marine phylum. It is believed that 2% of its known 11000 species are venomous to humans. Incidents caused by jellyfish are common all around the globe, with serious manifestations and occasional deaths reported in some  countries. The Australian box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri , has been reported to be  very dangerous to humans, as contact with its tentacles can provoke immediate cardiovascular collapse and death within minutes. Though other volumes on venomous marine fauna are available, this is the first comprehensive book focusing on venomous marine cnidarians.

The PBT larvae were collected at the surface layer (≥30 m depth) in 2016 and 2017, and 172 and 114 individuals from the Japan Sea and Nansei area, respectively, were analyzed. A generalized additive model applied revealed that the number of prey in the gut increased with growth, in waters above 24 °C and in subsurface (~30 m depth) waters, during daytime. The total dry weights of prey per gut calculated from the size of copepods and cladocerans also increased during daytime and with growth. Both the morphological and metagenetic analyses indicated that the taxonomic composition of gut contents was influenced by the food selectivity of PBT larvae and by zooplankton (prey) availability in the ambient water. Podonidae were positively selected as PBT larvae prey in both areas, and copepodites and adult Corycaeidae and Pontellidae were positively selected in the Nansei area only. A metagenetic approach indicated Calanidae copepods and soft zooplankton such as appendicularians as important preys in both areas. Other copepods were not positively selected using this approach, but Clausocalanidae and Oithonidae were frequently detected in the Japan Sea. This might be related to the higher abundances of these families in the Japan Sea than in the Nansei area. On the other hand, the cladoceran Penilia avirostris and the copepods Echinostomatidae and Oncaeidae were rarely observed in the guts of PBT larvae although were abundant in the water column. Overall, PBT larvae feed abundantly and grow fast in warm and long-day waters rich in Podonidae, Corycaeidae, Pontellidae, and larval copepods, which contributes to their survival and recruitment in the Japan Sea and Nansei area.","Kodama, T.; Hirai, J.; Tawa, A.; Ishihara, T.; Ohshimo, S.",WOS:000554017400012,"Hirai, Junya, J.","Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.dsr2.2020.104745,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Japan Sea,Thunnus orientalis,Zooplankton,,Pacific Bluefin tuna; Japan sea; Western North Pacific; Cladoceran; Appendicularian; Metagenetic,Journal article,,,"Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan.",Japan,Pacific Bluefin tuna; Japan sea; Western North Pacific; Zooplankton; Cladoceran; Appendicularian; Metagenetic,REPRODUCTIVE CONDITION; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; MARINE CLADOCERANS; SOUTHERN BLUEFIN; TOYAMA BAY; SEA; FISH; THYNNUS; GROWTH; DISTRIBUTIONS,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Tokyo - Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute,x,Japan,,Research institute,Science

In this study, we compared the zooplankton composition, abundance, biomass, and spatial distribution in relationship with water characteristics on the western Chukchi Sea shelf. The community was dominated in number by copepods of the genera Pseudocalanus, Oithona, Microsetella, and bivalve larvae; in biomass, it was dominated by the copepod Calanus glacialis. The highest abundance and biomass of zooplankton were observed at the stations with the cold Winter Water and Melt Water. The zooplankton communities in the eastern corner of the Herald Canyon were influenced by the Anadyr/Bering Sea Water; in contrast, the zooplankton in the western corner of the Herald Canyon was more similar to the communities of the shallow Arctic seas. The trend of changes in the Chukchi Sea zooplankton community structure towards the predominance of small-sized crustacean species and their southward expansion along the southwestern Chukchi shelf are discussed.","Kasyan, V.",WOS:000541017300012,"Kasyan, Valentina, V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.polar.2020.100508,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Copepoda,"Composition, ""Spatial distribution"", ""Zooplankton""",,Chukchi sea,Journal article,,,"Russian Acad Sci, AV Zhirmunsky Natl Sci Ctr Marine Biol, Far Eastern Branch, Vladivostok, Russia.",Russia,,INTERANNUAL VARIATION; SUMMER; WATER; MESOZOOPLANKTON; HETEROGENEITY; PATTERNS; LIFE; FLOW,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - Far-Eastern Branch,x,Russia,,Research institute,Science

Bagnoli-Coroglio Bay (Gulf of Naples, Tyrrhenian Sea) is a typical example of historically contaminated coastal area due to industrial activities stopped at the beginning of nineties. In the present study we carried out a fine spatial scale analysis of the distribution of meiofaunal (and nematodes) assemblages along five bathymetric transects located at increasing distance from the historical source of contamination in relation with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and heavy metal concentrations present in the sediment. Meiofaunal abundance and biomass changed widely along transects but independent from the distance from the source of contamination. Even when the contamination levels were expected to induce significant detrimental biological consequences, meiofaunal abundance and biomass were similar to those reported in unpolluted benthic coastal areas worldwide. Conversely, biodiversity in terms of meiofaunal taxa richness was generally low (range: 5–8 taxa in 12 of the overall 15 stations investigated). This was explained by the lack of sensitive groups such as ostracods, gastrotrichs and tardigrades commonly encountered in benthic coastal ecosystems, thus reflecting an overall poor/moderate environmental quality of the investigated area. Nematode (structural and functional) diversity was also low, particularly at stations characterized by higher contamination levels. At the same time, nematode species composition did not change significantly among stations suggesting a widespread effect of contaminants able to reduce the variability (i.e., turnover diversity) within the assemblages of the whole study area. Overall, our results indicate that even decades after the cessation of contaminant emissions, benthic biodiversity was affected in terms of both meiofaunal taxa and nematode species. These findings strongly reinforce the call for reducing sources of chronic pollution in marine ecosystems and provide new insights for a better understanding of the ecological recovery of historically contaminated marine environments.","Gambi, C.; Dell’Anno, A.; Corinaldesi, C.; Lo Martire, M.; Musco, L.; Da Ros, Z.; Armiento, G.; Danovaro, R.",WOS:000528612000009,"Musco, Luigi, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.104907,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,,ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; NEMATODE ASSEMBLAGES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; MINE TAILINGS; TROPHIC STATE; ADRIATIC SEA; OIL-SPILL,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Toxicology,Marche Polytechnic University,x,Italy,,University,Science

Despite substantial seasonal variations of limnological conditions such as photic and mixed layer depths, cyanoprokaryotes/cyanobacteria represented on average 60% of the phytoplankton biomass, followed by diatoms, which contributed ~25% of chlorophyll a, and by green algae, chrysophytes and cryptophytes. 248 taxa were identified with clear prevalence of cyanobacteria (104 taxa), from the morphological groups of coccal and filamentous species (non-heterocytous and heterocytous). The high proportion of heterocytous cyanobacteria, along with a relatively high particulate organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, suggest N limitation as well as light limitation, most pronounced in the pelagic sites.

It took at least 10–15 years for trochus populations to become established on Samoa’s reefs. Underwater visual censuses in 2018 showed that populations are now established around both main islands, Upolu and Savai’i, although they are spatially variable. The project estimated that over 1000 fishers now harvest trochus in Samoa, and 300 of them sell the flesh in villages, roadside stalls and markets. Informal networks are used to sell and distribute the seafood in villages. Analyses found the benefits to be inclusive and gender equitable. For a majority of fishers surveyed, trochus is now one of the most harvested reef resources by volume. The project found significant positive impacts to income, local diets and satisfaction of fishers. Further income from trochus could be made through handicrafts from the shells or shell exports. Permitting exports would need to be accompanied by the implementation of a fishery management plan and a robust system of monitoring, control and surveillance. The fishery is a welcomed success story in an era when seafood supply in the Pacific is under threat.","Purcell, S.W.; Tiitii, S.; Aiafi, J.; Tone, A.; Tony, A.; Lesa, M.; Esau, C.; Cullis, B.; Gogel, B.; Seinor, K.; Ceccarelli, D.M.; Tagliafico, A.",,"Tiitii, Sapeti, S.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the life sciences, the design of data discovery and integration tools has relied on the premise that a formal classificatory system for expressing a body of data should be grounded in consensus definitions for classifications. On this approach, exemplified by the realist program of the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, progress is maximized by grounding the representation and aggregation of data on settled knowledge. We argue that historical practices in systematic biology provide an important and overlooked alternative approach to classifying and disseminating data, based on a principle of coordinative rather than definitional consensus. Systematists have developed a robust system for referring to taxonomic entities that can deliver high quality data discovery and integration without invoking consensus about reality or “settled” science.","Sterner, B.; Witteveen, J.; Franz, N.",WOS:000512227500001,"Sterner, Beckett, B.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s40656-020-0300-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Bio-ontologies, Big data, Data-centrism, Consensus principle, Coordination, Ontology alignment, Biodiversity informatics",Journal article,,,"Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",USA,Bio-ontologies; Big data; Data-centrism; Consensus principle; Coordination; Ontology alignment; Biodiversity informatics,NATURAL-HISTORY; GENE ONTOLOGY; NOMENCLATURE; HOMOLOGY; REALISM; METHODOLOGY; EMERGENCE; EVOLUTION; LANGUAGE; TAXONOMY,History & Philosophy Of Science,History & Philosophy of Science,Arizona State University,x,USA,,University,Science

For marine species, previous works have analysed trends in the discovery of extant species, without comparison to the fossil record. Here, we compared the rate of description between extant and fossil species of the same group of marine invertebrates, Bryozoa. There are nearly 3 times as many described fossil species as there are extant species. This indicates that current biodiversity represents only a small proportion of Earth’s past biodiversity, at least for Bryozoa. Despite these differences, our results showed similar trends in the description of new species between extant and fossil groups. There has been an increase in taxonomic effort during the past century, characterized by an increase in the number of taxonomists, but no change in their relative productivity (i.e. similar proportions of authors described most species). The 20th century had the most species described per author, reflecting increased effort in exploration and technological developments. Despite this progress, future projections in the discovery of bryozoan species predict that around 10 and 20% more fossil and extant species than named species, respectively, will be discovered by 2100, representing 2430 and 1350 more fossil and extant species, respectively. This highlights the continued need for both new species descriptions and taxonomic revisions, as well as ecological and biogeographical research, to better understand the biodiversity of Bryozoa.","Pagès-Escolà, M.; Bock, P.E.; Gordon, D.P.; Wilson, S.; Linares, C.; Hereu, B.; Costello, M.",WOS:000521737900006,"Gordon, Dennis, D.P.",National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps13201,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Diversity, Descriptions, Authors, Marine, Fossil, Bryozoans, Species accumulation curves",Journal article,,,"Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBIO, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",Spain,Diversity; Descriptions; Authors; Marine; Fossil; Bryozoans; Species accumulation curves,GLOBAL SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; COMPLETENESS; RATES; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EXTINCTION; HISTORY; CURVES; ROCK,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA),x,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

The basis for these recommendations are that they are appropriate in terms of generating information that is both fit-for-purpose and cost-effective in terms of informing management decisions, providing for consistent current and future reporting mechanisms, and for generating new scientific understanding through its application in longitudinal ecological observations. Importantly, consideration was also given to applications that had the potential to be used in or applied to provide a common basis for integrating disparate current monitoring programs within the Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program (RIMReP). Such integration can only be achieved when data standardisation and compatibility among methodologies is assured. Furthermore, the standardisation of classifications will be important in facilitating machine learning and helping monitoring programs transition to automated image processing which has the potential to greatly expand the scope and timeliness of monitoring programs on the Great Barrier Reef (the Reef).","Babcock, R.; Bridge, T.",,"Babcock, R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following overview of seafood safety concerns is intended to help readers to understand potential risks associated with parasites in seafood products and the need for a national approach to reduce or minimise them. It is important to note that parasite infections are not limited to seafood: all other types of foods, including vegetables and red meat can also be infected with a broad range of parasites, some of which are moredangerous than parasites in seafood. The main issue is lack of science based contemporaneous safety protocols which focus on seafood-borne parasites. As a result, in Australia regulatory control of parasites in seafood lags far behind other food sectors. Seafood safety is a broad topic. The focus of this article is on an understudied field in Australia, seafood-borne parasitic diseases.

Oil contents in certain groups of marine microalgae are extraordinarily rich and abundant and therefore have been commercialized as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid supplements and mass production of microalgaebased biodiesels has been demonstrated by diverse research groups. Numerous natural products from marine microalgae with significant biological activities are reported yearly and this is attributed to their unique adaptive abilities to the great diversity of marine habitats and harsh conditions of marine environments.

Diversity estimation theory statistically uses species occurrence records and sampling completeness (coverage) to predict diversity in terms of species richness, dominance and evenness. We estimated Scleractinia coral species diversity at different spatial resolutions, based on 109,296 occurrences and range data for 697 species, using an incidence‐based Hill's numbers approach through a rarefaction and extrapolation technique. We found that spatial patterns of diversity estimates were dependent on a geographic scale. The latitudinal and longitudinal diversity gradients, particularly at finer spatial scales, differed from species range‐based coral biodiversity hotspots of previous studies. The western Indian Ocean was predicted to have the most coral species, with greater diversities than in the Indo‐Pacific Coral Triangle. We concluded that the identification of marine biodiversity hotspots is sensitive to species commission errors (from range maps) and biased sampling coverage. Moreover, estimates of the geographic distribution of species richness informed us of a set of priority areas (the northeastern coast of Australia, central Coral Triangle and coast of Madagascar) for future sampling of unknown coral species occurrence. Our findings of biogeographical survey priorities contribute to filling biodiversity shortfalls for tropical coral reefs through sampling completeness, and consequently for development of conservation planning.","Kusumoto, B.; Costello, M.J.; Kubota, Y.; Shiono, T.; Wei, C.-L.; Yasuhara, M.; Chao, A.",WOS:000517945800001,"Yasuhara, Moriaki, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/1440-1703.12096,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,Coral reefs,,"Hill's number, species incidence, sampling bias, marine biodiversity hotspots",Journal article,,,"Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Okinawa, Japan.",Japan,coral reefs; Hill's number; species incidence; sampling bias; marine biodiversity hotspots,GEOGRAPHICAL SAMPLING BIAS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; PATTERNS; EXTRAPOLATION; RAREFACTION; COMPLETENESS; INFORMATION; SHORTFALLS,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Within the aquaculture sector, molluskan culture is a relatively benign method of producing a high‐quality, healthy, and sustainable protein source for the expanding human population. We modeled the vulnerability of global bivalve mariculture to impacts of CC‐OA over the period 2020–2100, under RCP8.5. Vulnerability, assessed at the national level, was dependent on CC‐OA‐related exposure, taxon‐specific sensitivity and adaptive capacity in the sector. Exposure risk increased over time from 2020 to 2100, with ten nations predicted to experience very high exposure to CC‐OA in at least one decade during the period 2020–2100. Predicted high sensitivity in developing countries resulted, primarily, from the cultivation of species that have a narrow habitat tolerance, while in some European nations (France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) high sensitivity was attributable to the relatively high economic value of the shellfish production sector. Predicted adaptive capacity was low in developing countries primarily due to governance issues, while in some developed countries (Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) it was linked to limited species diversity in the sector. Developing and least developed nations (n = 15) were predicted to have the highest overall vulnerability. Across all nations, 2060 was identified as a tipping point where predicted CC‐OA will be associated with the greatest challenge to shellfish production. However, rapid declines in mollusk production are predicted to occur in the next decade for some nations, notably North Korea. Shellfish culture offers human society a low‐impact source of sustainable protein. This research highlights, on a global scale, the likely extent and nature of the CC‐OA‐related threat to shellfish culture and this sector enabling early‐stage adaption and mitigation.","Stewart-Sinclair, P.J.; Last, K.S.; Payne, B.L.; Wilding, T.A.",WOS:000524417200030,"Stewart-Sinclair, Phoebe, P.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.6149,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Scottish Marine Inst, Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",Scotland,aquaculture; climate change; food-security; ocean acidification; shellfish; vulnerability assessment,FISHERIES; IMPACTS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS),x,UK,,Research institute,Science

Estimates of global seagrass spatial distribution differ greatly throughout the published literature, ranging from 177,000 to 600,000 km2 with models suggesting potential distribution an order of magnitude higher. The requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement by outlining National Determined Contributions (NDC's) to reduce emissions is placing an increased global focus on the spatial extent, loss and restoration of seagrass meadows. Now more than ever there is a need to provide a more accurate and consistent measure of the global spatial distribution of seagrass. There is also a need to be able to assess the global spread of other seagrass ecosystem services and in their extension, the values of these services. In this study, by rationalising and updating a range of existing datasets of seagrass distribution around the globe, we have estimated with Moderate to High confidence the global seagrass area to date as 160,387 km2, but possibly 266,562 km2 with lower confidence. We break this global estimate down to a national level with a detailed analysis of the current state of mapped distribution and estimates of seagrass area per country. Accurate estimates, however, are challenged by large areas remaining unmapped and inconsistent measures being used. Through the examination of current global maps, we are able to propose a pathway forward for improving mapping of this important resource.","McKenzie, L.; Nordlund, L.M.; Jones, B.L.; Cullen-Unsworth, L.C.; Roelfsema, C.M.; Unsworth, R.K.F.",WOS:000553766300001,"Unsworth, Richard, R.K.F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7d06,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Mapping,,Species distribution; Eelgrass; Sea grass; Global extent; Spatial distribution,Journal article,,,"Project Seagrass, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, Wales.",Wales,mapping; species distribution; eelgrass; sea grass; global extent; spatial distribution,REEF; HABITATS; COVER; OCEAN; FIELD,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,,,,

Outcomes are challenging to project at national scales, despite their importance for management decisions. Using an ensemble of six global marine ecosystem models we analyzed marine ecosystem responses to climate change from 1971 to 2099 in Canada’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under four standardized emissions scenarios. By 2099, under business-as-usual emissions (RCP8.5) projected marine animal biomass declined by an average of −7.7% (±29.5%) within the Canadian EEZ, dominated by declines in the Pacific (−24% ± 24.5%) and Atlantic (−25.5% ± 9.5%) areas; these were partially compensated by increases in the Canadian Arctic (+26.2% ± 38.4%). Lower emissions scenarios projected successively smaller biomass changes, highlighting the benefits of stronger mitigation targets. Individual model projections were most consistent in the Atlantic and Pacific, but highly variable in the Arctic due to model uncertainties in polar regions. Different trajectories of future marine biomass changes will require regional-specific responses in conservation and management strategies, such as adaptive planning of marine protected areas and speciesspecific management plans, to enhance resilience and rebuilding of Canada’s marine ecosystems and commercial fish stocks.","Bryndum-Buchholz, A.; Prentice, F.; Tittensor, D.P.; Blanchard, J.L.; Cheung, W.W.L.; Christensen, V.; Galbraith, E.D.; Maury, O.; Lotze, H.K.",WOS:000518822800001,"Prentice, Faelan, F.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1139/facets-2019-0035,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,"climate change, ensemble modeling, marine ecosystem models, Canada Exclusive Economic Zone, Fish-MIP, projection uncertainty",Journal article,,,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Oxford, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",Canada,climate change; ensemble modeling; marine ecosystem models; Canada Exclusive Economic Zone; Fish-MIP; projection uncertainty,NORTHERN CANADA; GLOBAL OCEAN; ECOSYSTEMS; FISHERIES; PROJECTIONS; IMPACTS; STABILIZATION; DEOXYGENATION; PATHWAY; COASTAL,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Dalhousie University - Department of Biology,x,,,,

Marine spatial planning (MSP) is being applied in different Member States, mainly in the North Sea basin, as a way of easing tensions while promoting blue energy. The southernmost marine areas of the continent also have considerable energy potential that, as yet, has not been exploited due to the limitations imposed by a narrow and steep continental shelf, not to mention legal and administrative barriers. MSP processes currently being developed by the application of Directive 2014/89/EU present an opportunity to resolve these conflicts and promote sustainable use of MRE sources in southern Europe.

Global model estimates of riverine emission rates of anthropogenic litter are largely based on microplastic studies as long-term and holistic observations of riverine macroplastics are still scarce. This study therefore aims to contribute a detailed assessment of macrolitter in the transitional waters of three major North Sea tributaries: Ems, Weser, and Elbe. Litter surveys were carried out in four river compartments: along the embankment, on the river surface, in the water column, and on the river bed. The data revealed spatio-temporal variability and distinct pollution levels for each compartment. Beaches had the highest debris diversity and were significantly more littered than vegetated sites and harbors. Stony embankments were least polluted. Benthic litter levels appeared substantial despite rapid burial of objects being likely due to high suspended sediment loads. Two extrapolation approaches were tested to scale daily and annual litter emission quantities of surface- and subsurface-floating litter. Using the mean (median) litter item mass from water column samples, total annual mass discharges were calculated: ∼0.9 (0.2) t y<sup>−1</sup> to ∼2.8 (0.5) t y<sup>−1</sup> emitted via the Ems, ∼1.3 (0.2) t y<sup>−1</sup> to ∼12.0 (1.9) t y<sup>−1</sup> through the Weser, and ∼14.7 (2.4) t y<sup>−1</sup> to ∼801 (128) t y<sup>−1</sup> carried into the North Sea by the Elbe. These rates deviate considerably from previous model estimates of plastic loads discharged by these three rivers. Future studies should therefore ground-truth model estimates with more river-specific and long-term field observations. Overall, the estimated plastic debris discharge quantities account for <1% of the total mass of mismanaged plastic waste per catchment.","Schöneich-Argent, R.I.; Dau, K.; Freund, H.",WOS:000539427600135,"Schöneich-Argent, Rosanna, R.I.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114367,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Macroplastic; River; Litter discharge; River compartment,Journal article,,,"Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm ICBM, ICBM Wilhelmshaven, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",Germany,Macroplastic; River; Litter discharge; River compartment,PLASTIC DEBRIS; LITTER SOURCES; RIVERS; REVEAL,Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

However, most countries have not yet implemented large-scale no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). When a country closes a large fraction of its waters to fishing, it stands to lose a considerable level of fishery revenue. Although biodiversity and spillover fishing benefits may far exceed these losses, benefits from large-scale MPAs typically accrue to other countries or to the high seas. Here, to overcome this dilemma, we simulate and test an international fisheries management scheme with transferable fishing rights that incentivizes, rather than hinders, large-scale marine conservation. By combining a bioeconomic model of cross-country trading of fishing rights with vessel-level tracking data before and after a large-scale conservation action is implemented, we show that transferable fishing rights and a biomass-based allocation rule are pivotal to incentivize conservation under this market-based setting. Our work focuses on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS)—an environmental market that is employed by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (a group of nine Pacific Island nations) to manage their tuna fisheries—and areas in which large-scale conservation interventions have taken place. Overall, these results provide a template for how to incentivize countries to engage in large-scale marine conservation within a market-based setting.","Villaseñor-Derbez, J.C.; Lynham, J.; Costello, C.",WOS:000507792200002,"Villaseñor-Derbez, Juan Carlos, J.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41893-019-0459-z,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",USA,,MANAGEMENT; RESERVES; RIGHTS,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of California Santa Barbara,x,USA,,University,Science

Reframing it as a ‘blue fix’, we argue that the blue growth discourse facilitates new opportunities for capital accumulation, while claiming that this accumulation is compatible with social and ecological aims as well. The blue fix is made up of three underlying sub-fixes. First of all, the conservation fix quenches the social thirst for action in the face of climate change. Here we see how protecting marine areas can be an important part of mitigating climate change, but in practice, gains at the national level are overshadowed by the ongoing expansion of offshore drilling for oil and gas. Second, the protein fix satisfies the growing global demand for healthy food and nutrition through the expansion of capital-intensive large-scale aquaculture, while ignoring the negative socio-ecological impacts, which effectively squeeze small-scale capture fishing out, while industrial capture fishing remains well positioned to expand into as well as supply industrial aquaculture with fish feed from pelagic fish. And third, an energy fix offers a burst of wind energy and a splash of new deep-sea minerals without disturbing the familiar and persistent foundation of oil and gas. This dimension of the blue fix emphasizes the transition to wind and solar energy, but meanwhile the deep sea mining for minerals required by these new technologies launches us into unknown ecological territories with little understood consequences. The synergy of these three elements brought together in a reframing of ocean politics manifests as a balancing act to frame blue growth as ‘sustainable’ and in everyone’s interest, which we critically analyze and discuss in this article.","Brent, Z.W.; Barbesgaard, M.; Pedersen, C.",WOS:000511965300003,"Pedersen, Carsten, C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Blue growth; Blue economy; Marine protected areas; Aquaculture; Oil and gas; Deep sea mining,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SELLING NATURE; ECONOMY; FISHERIES; SEA; OIL,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,

Shark fins are consumed during special occasions among primarily the East Asian elite, whereas shark meat is consumed by many globally, including by fishers and their families. Policies guiding the management of shark fisheries vary globally, with inconsistent protections for sharks across their ranges and insufficient consideration of the multifaceted demands for shark products. Banning shark fishing is a popular management strategy; however, a full ban on shark fishing has the potential to threaten both food security and food sovereignty of small-scale fishing communities. In this paper, we investigate the tension between the subsistence and commercial value of sharks, examining the history and current status of shark fishing practices in Madagascar. From this case study, we analyze how current management strategies contribute to shark conservation and food sovereignty. Ultimately, we argue in favor of a rights-based approach to shark fisheries policy in Madagascar, and in other food insecure nations in the process of evaluating and expanding their shark conservation efforts, that considers (a) the end use of the sharks (e.g. implement policies favoring fishers who land sharks for subsistence), (b) the mode of access fishers use to harvest sharks (e.g. imposing greater restrictions on industrial vessels), and (c) direct and ongoing participation of local fishers in decision-making occurring at all scales of governance. While these suggestions pertain to shark fisheries globally, they are especially pertinent to fisheries-dependent countries with high rates of food insecurity in the Global South.","Baker-Médard, M.; Faber, J.",WOS:000517348900015,"Baker-Médard, Merrill, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103805,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Middlebury Coll, Environm Studies Program, Franklin Environm Ctr Hillcrest, 531 Coll St, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",USA,,CONSERVATION; FISHERIES; SCALE; MANAGEMENT; SECURITY; PERSPECTIVES; ECOLOGY; RIGHTS,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,,,,,,

To inform these negotiations, we identified existing and emerging human activities and influences that affect ABNJ and evaluated management options available to mitigate the most pervasive, with highest potential for impact and probability of emergence. The highest-ranking activities and influences that affect ABNJ were fishing/hunting, maritime shipping, climate change and its associated effects, land-based pollution and mineral exploitation. Management options are diverse and available through a variety of actors, although their actions are not always effective. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were the only consistently effective option to mitigate impacts across high-ranked activities and influences. However, addressing land-based pollution will require national action to prevent this at its source, and MPAs offer only a partial solution for climate change. A new ABNJ ILBI could help unify management options and actors to conserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use. Incorporating a mechanism to establish effective ABMTs into the ILBI will help deliver multiple objectives based on the ecosystem approach.","O'Leary, B.C.; Hoppit, G.; Townley, A.; Allen, H.L.; McIntyre, C.J.; Roberts, C.M.",WOS:000519661400009,"Hoppit, George, G.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105110,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Areas beyond national jurisdiction; ABNJ; High seas; Marine protected areas; UNCLOS,Journal article,,,"Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Manchester M5 4WX, Lancs, England.",England,Areas beyond national jurisdiction; ABNJ; High seas; Marine protected areas; UNCLOS,MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; REGIONAL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; PLASTIC DEBRIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL OCEAN; CONSERVATION; BYCATCH; CLOSURES; RESERVES; IMPACT,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,University of Salford - School of Environement & Life Sciences,x,UK,,University,Science

We first built a multilocus phylogeny and a calibrated species tree with a relaxed clock using StarBEAST2 to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and divergence times among <i>Leiogalathea</i> species. We used BioGeoBEARS and a DEC model, implemented in RevBayes, to reconstruct ancestral distribution ranges and the biogeographic history of the genus.

They also revealed the divergence of the Atlantic species around 25 million years ago (Ma), intense cladogenesis 15–25 Ma and low levels of speciation over the last 5 million years (Myr). The four <i>Leiogalathea</i> lineages showed similar patterns of speciation: allopatric speciation followed by range expansion and subsequent stasis. <i>Leiogalathea</i> started diversifying during the Oligocene, likely in the Tethyan. The Atlantic lineage then split from its Indo‐Pacific sister group due to vicariance driven by closure of the Tethys Seaway. The Atlantic lineage is less speciose compared with the Indo‐Pacific lineages, with the Tropical Southwestern Pacific being the current centre of diversity. <i>Leiogalathea</i> diversification coincided with cladogenetic peaks in shallow‐water genera, indicating that historical biogeographic events similarly shaped the diversification and distribution of both deep‐sea and shallow‐water squat lobsters.","Rodríguez-Flores, P.C.; Buckley, D.; MacPherson, E.; Corbari, L.; Machordom, A.",WOS:000517767300001,"MacPherson, Enrique, E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/zsc.12414,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Spain,allopatric speciation; comparative diversification; deep-sea speciation; Galatheoidea; historical patterns; morphological stasis,BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; CRUSTACEA DECAPODA ANOMURA; PACIFIC; MODELS; EXTINCTION; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY; HISTORY; SHELF; DIVERSIFICATION,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,Evolutionary Biology; Zoology,CSIC - National Museum of Natural Sciences (MNCN),x,Spain,,Research institute,Science

We assessed available nesting habitat and spatial distribution of nesting activity during rapid surveys of 90% of the archipelago's coastline in 1996, 1999, 2006 and 2016. We quantified seasonality and mean annual egg clutch production from monthly track counts during 2006–2018 along a 2.8 km index beach on Diego Garcia island. An estimated 56% (132 km) of coastline provided suitable nesting habitat. Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos atolls accounted for 90.4% of hawksbill and 70.4% of green turtle nesting. Hawksbill turtles showed distinct nesting peaks during October–February, and green turtles nested year-round with elevated activity during June–October. Estimates of 6,300 hawksbill and 20,500 green turtle clutches laid annually during 2011–2018 indicate that nesting on the Chagos Archipelago has increased 2–5 times for hawksbill turtles and 4–9 times for green turtles since 1996. Regional estimates indicate green turtles produce 10 times more egg clutches than hawksbill turtles, and the Chagos Archipelago accounts for 39–51% of an estimated 12,500–16,000 hawksbill and 14–20% of an estimated 104,000–143,500 green turtle clutches laid in the south-west Indian Ocean.

While conventional modes of conservation have made strides in mitigating impacts of human activities on ocean ecosystems, those strategies alone cannot completely stem the tide of mounting threats. Biotechnology and genomic research should be harnessed and developed within conservation frameworks to foster the persistence of viable ocean ecosystems. This document distills the results of a targeted survey, the Ocean Genomics Horizon Scan, which assessed opportunities to bring novel genetic rescue tools to marine conservation. From this Horizon Scan, we have identified how novel approaches from synthetic biology and genomics can alleviate major marine threats. While ethical frameworks for biotechnological interventions are necessary for effective and responsible practice, here we primarily assessed technological and social factors directly affecting technical development and deployment of biotechnology interventions for marine conservation. Genetic insight can greatly enhance established conservation methods, but the severity of many threats may demand genomic intervention. While intervention is controversial, for many marine areas the cost of inaction is too high to allow controversy to be a barrier to conserving viable ecosystems. Here, we offer a set of recommendations for engagement and program development to deploy genetic rescue safely and responsibly.","Novak, B.J.; Fraser, D.; Maloney, T.H.",WOS:000519271500081,"Novak, Ben, B.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/genes11020209,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,genetic rescue; genetic insight; genomic intervention; biodiversity; biotechnology; marine science; marine conservation; ocean genomics; eDNA,Journal article,,,"Revive & Restore, 1505 Bridgeway 203, Sausalito, CA 94965 USA.",USA,genetic rescue; genetic insight; genomic intervention; biodiversity; biotechnology; marine science; marine conservation; ocean genomics; eDNA,POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; ATLANTIC SALMON; NEXT-GENERATION; HORSESHOE-CRAB; FACTOR-C; CORAL; TECHNOLOGIES; MEDICINE; SCIENCE,Genetics & Heredity,Genetics & Heredity,,,,,,

It includes 89 taxa belonging to 9 types and 13 classes (subclasses). Nematodes and Chordates are singly represented as a part of zoobenthos samples by the number of species and supraspecific taxa. Sipunculida include 1 class – Sipunculoidea. Nemertea are represented by two taxa. Cnidaria include 2 classes with 2 taxa in each one; Hydrozoa and Anthozoa are among them. Echinoderms consist of 1 class – Ophiuroidea, which combine 3 taxa. Arthropoda are characterized by a significant number of taxa (1 class, 14 species and supraspecific taxa). The subdominant group is represented by annelids (24 species and supraspecific taxa). As a dominant group, molluscs (37 species and supraspecific taxa) are represented by Bivalvia (22 species and supraspecific taxa, including 1 egg laying), Gastropoda (14 species and supraspecific taxa) and Caudofoveata (1 species). The specific species diversity of the benthic community in the Dvina Bay of the White Sea characterizes it as a water body with good feeding potential for benthophage commercial fish. The maximum number of zoobenthos taxa is found in clayey bottom sediments, and the minimum amount ‒ in silty sands.

The present study documents poleward movements of up to eight species of nominally ‘tropical’ macroinvertebrates (molluscs, polychaetes, crustaceans and foraminifera) from intertidal mudflats on the south east coast of Australia. The speed of movement was comparable with that for Australian marine fauna generally, but was particularly fast for worms and molluscs (~70–300 km decade<sup>−1</sup>) and may be facilitated by the southward flowing East Australia Current. Further, two temperate taxa appear to have extended their ranges northwards. Changes in species biogeographic ranges raises questions surrounding the response of ecological processes within the altered and novel species combinations, including processes that underpin valuable ecosystem services. Using biological traits analysis to investigate how the observed species range changes might have impacted mudflat ecosystem functioning, and to predict the possible impacts of further poleward movements of tropical taxa. Our models suggest the changes to date, and those likely to occur in the near future, are within the envelope whereby ecological functioning is maintained by functional compensation and redundancy within the mudflat assemblage. However, in the most extreme scenario the replacement of temperate by tropical taxa resulted in major changes in ecological functioning with potential impacts on nutrient cycling and C-cycling, undermining the potential of these mudflats to continue to deliver critical ecosystem services. The widespread nature of biogeographic range shifts and the value of coastal systems should add further weight to calls for global action to mitigate global temperature change.","Caswell, B.A.; Dissanayake, N.G.; Frid, C.L.J.",WOS:000527916600012,"Frid, Christopher, C.L.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106692,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Climate change; Ecosystem services; Infauna; Functional compensation; Biological traits; Novel assemblages,Journal article,,,"Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Parklands Dr, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",Australia,Climate change; Ecosystem services; Infauna; Functional compensation; Biological traits; Novel assemblages,MORETON BAY; SPECIES TRAITS; TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FOOD-WEB; MARINE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; QUEENSLAND; IMPACTS,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Griffith University - Environmental Futures Research Institute (EFRI),x,Australia,,Research institute,Science

Hurricane Irma (2017, Atlantic Ocean) broke many records, including the fact that it was the first category 5 hurricane making landfall in Cuba since 1924. In this study, we assess the oceanic response of the waters of the Cuban Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) to the passage of this hurricane. Overall, Irma led to a weak sea surface cooling in the EEZ, which was associated with the thermal structure of its waters and the fact that it was affected by the left-side quadrants of this hurricane. This cooling was driven by mixing and upwelling processes. In contrast, the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration increase was comparable with climatological records, suggesting that horizontal advection of coastal waters and entrainment of chl-a rich waters from remote regions of the GoM influenced the post-storm chl-a concentration. Moreover, Irma increased the chl-a concentration in the northeastern GoM and stimulated the offshore transport of these chl-a-rich waters to the interior GoM. A high chl-a plume (HCP) extended southward across the eastern GoM during the first post-storm week of Irma, and these waters reached the northwestern Cuban coast following the Loop Current. An intensification of the geostrophic currents of an anticyclonic eddy at the upper front of the Loop Current, the formation of an anticyclonic-cyclonic eddy pair in the northeastern GoM and wind-driven advection governed the extension of this HCP.","Avila-Alonso, D.; Baetens, J.M.; Cardenas, R.; De Baets, B.",WOS:000526318400002,"Cardenas, Rolando, R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s10236-020-01350-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Chlorophyll-a concentration; Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba; HurricaneIrma; Remote sensing; Sea surface temperature,Journal article,,,"Univ Ghent, KERMIT, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Fac Biosci Engn, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Chlorophyll-a concentration; Exclusive Economic Zone of Cuba; Hurricane Irma; Remote sensing; Sea surface temperature,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; TROPICAL CYCLONES; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MISSISSIPPI WATERS; RIVER DISCHARGE; HEAT-CONTENT; ARGO FLOATS,Oceanography,Oceanography,,,,,,

Integration of more than 4,000 tracks from 17 bird and mammal species reveals AESs around sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and over the Antarctic continental shelf. Fishing pressure is disproportionately concentrated inside AESs, and climate change over the next century is predicted to impose pressure on these areas, particularly around the Antarctic continent. At present, 7.1% of the ocean south of 40°S is under formal protection, including 29% of the total AESs. The establishment and regular revision of networks of protection that encompass AESs are needed to provide long-term mitigation of growing pressures on Southern Ocean ecosystems.","Hindell, Mark A.; Reisinger, Ryan R.; Ropert-Coudert, Yan; Hückstädt, Luis A.; Trathan, Philip N.; Bornemann, Horst; Charrassin, Jean-Benoît; Chown, Steven L.; Costa, Daniel P.; Danis, Bruno; Lea, Mary-Anne; Thompson, David; Torres, Leigh G.; Van de Putte, Anton P.; Alderman, Rachael; Andrews-Goff, Virginia; Arthur, Ben; Ballard, Grant; Bengtson, John; Bester, Marthán N.; Blix, Arnoldus Schytte; Boehme, Lars; Bost, Charles-André; Boveng, Peter; Cleeland, Jaimie; Constantine, Rochelle; Corney, Stuart; Crawford, Robert J.

Obtaining measurements of primary production across entire assemblages of algae over ecologically meaningful spatial scales is difficult, and acoustic techniques emerge as a method to consider. Acoustics has the potential to detect oxygen in gaseous form, hence it can measure primary production that is unseen by methods that use dissolved oxygen to estimate productivity. With levels of dissolved oxygen in kelp environments regularly reaching supersaturation, it is possible - even likely - that ecologically significant proportions of production have been neglected by traditional methods. To investigate the potential use of underwater acoustics in monitoring productivity of macroalgal habitats an experiment was run over two weeks during the Austral summer in February 2012 in Canoe Bay, Tasmania. This paper details the results of ray-based acoustic predictive models for two periods during the experiment chosen to compare contrasting diurnal productivity periods, together with inverted acoustic propagation waveguide features from the empirical experiment itself for these periods. Results of the Bellhop modelling suggest that acoustic transmissions can detect ecologically significant proportions of oxygen in gaseous form in seaweed environments (> 5% of total predicted production). However, changes in diurnal cycles of oxygen production were not seen in the empirical acoustic data during the experimental period, indicating that it is unlikely that there was a significant level of oxygen in gaseous form in the canopy layer. This work details the first research into the use of acoustics to measure productivity in macroalgal systems. It is possible that further research, particularly in highly productive environments or when conditions are more favourable, may prove acoustics to be a useful tool for assisting in monitoring primary productivity in seaweed communities.","Randall, J.; Johnson, C.R.; Ross, J.; Hermand, J.-P.",WOS:000514018900019,"Ross, Jeff, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151309,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Acoustic modelling; Acoustics; Macroalgae; Primary productivity;Seaweed; Microbubbles,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the prehistoric finds have been discovered by chance because of construction work and development at the shore edge or during underwater investigations of shipwrecks. Eustatic sea-level changes would have exposed very extensive areas of now-submerged landscape, especially in the northern Adriatic, of great importance in the Palaeolithic and early Mesolithic periods. Because of sinking coastlines in more recent millennia, submerged palaeoshorelines and archaeological remains of settlement activity extend as late as the medieval period. In consequence, the chronological range of prehistoric underwater finds extends from the Mousterian period through to the Late Iron Age. Known sites currently number 33 in the SPLASHCOS Viewer with the greatest number belonging to the Neolithic or Bronze Age periods, but ongoing underwater surveys continue to add new sites to the list. Systematic research has intensified in the past decade and demonstrates the presence of in situ culture layers, excellent conditions of preservation including wooden remains in many cases, and the presence of artificial structures of stone and wood possibly built as protection against sea-level rise or as fish traps. Existing discoveries demonstrate the scope for new research and new discoveries and the integration of archaeological investigations with palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic analyses of submerged sediments in lakes and on the seabed. A major challenge for the future is to develop better procedures for the integration of scientific research, commercial and industrial development, and the management and protection of the underwater heritage.","Rossi, I.R.; Karavanic, I.; Butorac, V.",,"Rossi, Irena Radic, I.R.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/978-3-030-37367-2_18,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,", Palaeolithic Mesolithic, Neolithic,Bronze Age, Submerged landscapes, Underwater settlements, Wood",Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bioconstruction, considerably extended, resulted very complex and diversified in the associated community of structuring organisms. This latter included 165 taxa attributable to different ecological groups occurring in different microhabitats of the bioconstruction. Among the secondary structuring taxa there were scleractinians, serpulids and bryozoans, all contributing to the deposition of calcium carbonate, and poriferans, helping to bind shells together or eroding carbonate by boring species.

Results show a steep uniform decline in the number of freshwater mollusks across the site that occurred during the Preclassic to Classic transition, when large region-wide political changes, including the development of more complex and centralized political organization, took place throughout the Maya region. Evidence of species introductions (e.g., turkeys from central Mexico and possibly the <i>Dermatemys</i> river turtle from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec) and variations in resource exchange (e.g. marine shells) over time indicate that Ceibal was one of likely many communities involved in long-distance animal exchange networks.

Here, we analyzed transcriptomes of 20 terebelliforms and an outgroup to build a robust phylogeny of the main lineages grounded on 12,674 orthologous genes. We then supplemented this backbone phylogeny with a denser sampling of 121 species using five genes and 90 morphological characters to elucidate fine-scale relationships. The monophyly of six major taxa was supported: Pectinariidae, Ampharetinae, Alvinellidae, Trichobranchidae, Terebellidae and Melinninae. The latter, traditionally a subfamily of Ampharetidae, was unexpectedly the sister to Terebellidae, and hence becomes Melinnidae, and Ampharetinae becomes Ampharetidae. We found no support for the recently proposed separation of Telothelepodidae, Polycirridae and Thelepodidae from Terebellidae. Telothelepodidae was nested within Thelepodinae and is accordingly made its junior synonym. Terebellidae contained the subfamily-ranked taxa Terebellinae and Thelepodinae. The placement of the simplified Polycirridae within Terebellinae differed from previous hypotheses, warranting the division of Terebellinae into Lanicini, Procleini, Terebellini and Polycirrini. Ampharetidae (excluding Melinnidae) were well-supported as the sister group to Alvinellidae and we recognize three clades: Ampharetinae, Amaginae and Amphicteinae. Our analysis found several paraphyletic genera and undescribed species. Morphological transformations on the phylogeny supported the hypothesis of an ancestor that possessed both branchiae and chaetae, which is at odds with proposals of a “naked” ancestor. Our study demonstrates how a robust backbone phylogeny can be combined with dense taxon coverage and morphological traits to give insights into the evolutionary history and transformation of traits.","Stiller, J.; Tilic, E.; Rousset, V.; Pleijel, F.; Rouse, G.W.",WOS:000533889200016,"Stiller, Josefin, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3390/biology9040073,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Annelida, ""Terebelliformia""",,,"phylogenomics, transcriptomics",Journal article,,,"Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",Denmark,phylogenomics; transcriptomics; Annelida; Terebelliformia,LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; AMPHARETIDAE ANNELIDA; HYDROTHERMAL VENTS; 18S RDNA; COLD SEEPS; 28S RDNA; POLYCHAETA; CHARACTERS; PACIFIC; ULTRASTRUCTURE,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,,,,

The potential use of these meiobenthic organisms as indicators of gaseous hydrocarbons reservoirs existing under the seabed is evaluated according to two linked axes, namely, the dual analysis of abiotic factors (physical and chemical parameters of the water column, gasmetrical, geochemical, lithological, and mineralogical properties of the sediments) and biotic characteristics (quantitative and taxonomic composition of foraminifers, nematodes, and ostracods). Studies of this kind have been directed toward developing interdisciplinary methods to improve the search for HG accumulations, especially methane, under the seabed.

ISBN 9783656536734. 62 pp.","True awareness of the great importance and vulnerability of natural spaces and resources is at the basis of innovative, holistic approaches to management such as ecosystem-based Marine Spatial Planning (EB-MSP). Under this perspective, there is an increasing need for reliable and meaningful baseline maps to provide decision-makers with straightforward information on the intrinsic biological value of a given marine/coastal area. The aims of this work are (1) to establish a spatial biological valuation of the Belgian coastal zone, using Marine Biological Valuation methods (MBV) (Derous 2007); and (2) to explore the applications of MBV for EB-MSP under different scenarios of space-use conflict at the Belgian coast (beach nourishment and nature conservation). Biological data from 1995 to 2011 on four ecosystem components (macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos, and avifauna) have been integrated into a single database and used to perform MBV. Despite time constraints, spatial coverage and overall data availability were surprisingly satisfactory and allowed for significant trends and patterns to be observed. Results support a seaward extension of the nature reserve of ""IJzermonding"" in Lombardsijde beach. Detailed analysis of areas under coastal flood risk indicates that the use of MBV maps to assist management decisions at low jurisdictional levels in the Belgian coast is positively promising. Still, for an integrative approach, MBV maps should be considered along with other criteria defined within a solid decision-support system. Further research on the applications of MBV to coastal areas is still necessary to enhance the robustness of the tool and consequently strengthen its effectiveness within spatial planning strategies, towards an integrative and ecosystem-based management of coastal areas worldwide.","Laporta, L.",,"Laporta, Lia, L.","Gent University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology",,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Belgian Coast,,,,"marine, biological, valuation",Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department,x,Belgium,x,University,Science

Until now, the environmental forces that could be driving species richness patterns in the deep NW Pacific have not been explored widely. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize new species distribution data from four deep-sea expeditions to the NW Pacific (2010–2016), which include the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, the abyssal plain adjacent to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench (KKT) and the KKT, to better understand species connectivity, biodiversity patterns, and distribution ranges in deep-sea benthos in this region. To determine the best environmental predictors driving these deep-sea species richness patterns, we applied generalized additive (GAMs) and linear models (GLMs). We calculated the total number of geographic distribution records, alpha (total number of species per 10,000 km2 hexagonal cells) and gamma species richness (total number of species per 1° latitudinal bands), and expected number of species (rarefaction ES15). Our highest number of distribution records and gamma species richness during the last decade peaked at intermediate latitudes (42°−44°N) along the mesopelagic zone (500–1000 m) of the Sea of Japan and abyssopelagic zone (4000–6000 m) of the NW Pacific and KKT. When sampling bias was accounted for, the alpha species richness in bathypelagic zone (1000–4000 m) of Sea of Okhotsk and abyssopelagic zone (4000–6000 m) of the NW Pacific and KKT were as high as mesopelagic zone of the Sea of Japan. The similarity cluster analysis of species presence/absence in lower bathyal/hadal (3000–8500 m) revealed three distinct geographic regions including Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and KKT in the NW Pacific. The eastern sector of the Sea of Okhotsk and western KKT had c. 50% of species in common. Several species of deep-sea Bivalves, such as Dacrydium rostriferum and Vesicomya pacifica, had the greatest latitudinal distribution ranges among all species. Echinoderm Ophiura leptoctenia, had instead, the broadest bathymetric distribution ranges compared to all other collected species. GAM models indicated that dissolved oxygen was the best explanatory variable for predicting numbers of species, closely followed by the model including all environmental variables plus topography. However, the GLM models of species richness, with latitudinal intervals of 1° and 5°, found that the topography and temperature were the best predictors of number of species. GLM model outputs indicated that a model that contains only the number of distribution records is, for all practical purposes, as good as any model that contains an environmental predictor. This study provides new insights on the NW Pacific deep-sea species richness patterns, where dissolved oxygen might play an important role, especially when considering the Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) in the deep NW Pacific.","Saeedi, H.; Simões, M.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000528805100010,"Brandt, Angelika, A."," Univ Hamburg, Biozentrum Grindel & Zool Museum, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102296,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Species richness Endemicity Deep sea Sea of Japan Sea of Okhotsk Kuril-Kamchatka Trench (KKT) Generalized additive models (GAMs) Generalized linear models (GLM) Dissolved oxygen,Journal article,,,"Deep Sea Node, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",Germany,Species richness; Endemicity; Deep sea; Sea of Japan; Sea of Okhotsk; Kuril-Kamchatka Trench (KKT); Generalized additive models (GAMS); Generalized linear models (GLM); Dissolved oxygen,SPECIES RICHNESS; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DIVERSITY PATTERNS; DECLINING OXYGEN; ISOPODA ASELLOTA; ABYSSAL DEPTHS; ATLANTIC; DYNAMICS; SEAMOUNTS,Oceanography,Oceanography,University of Hamburg,x,Germany,,University,Science

In ice-free waters, phytoplankton abundance was low, and the weighted average biomass (8.0&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> – 123.1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) corresponded to oligotrophic waters and lower mesotrophic waters. In the upper layers of the water population abundance was dominated by small flagellates and picoplankton from, biomass – Arctic dinoflagellates (<em>Gymnodinium </em>spp.) and cold Atlantic complexes (<em>Gyrodinium lachryma, Alexandrium tamarense, Dinophysis norvegica</em>). The proportion of Atlantic species in phytoplankton reached 75%. The representatives of warm-water Atlantic complex (<em>Emiliania huxleyi, Rhizosolenia hebetata </em>f.<em> semispina, Ceratium horridum</em>) were recorded up to 80º N, as indicators of the penetration of warm Atlantic waters into the Arctic basin. The presence of oceanic Atlantic species as warm-water and cold systems in the high Arctic indicates the strengthening of processes of “atlantificacion” in the region.","Pautova, L.A.; Silkin, V.A.; Kravchishina, M.D.; Yakubenko, V.G.; Chultsova, A.L.",,"Chultsova, Anna, A.L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.33624/2587-9367-2019-2(4)-8-19,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,phytoplankton; structure of phytocenosis; diatoms; dinoflagellates; Barents Sea,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past and future of the marine bioinvasions along the Southwestern Atlantic. <i>Aquat. Invasions 15(1)</i>: 11-29","The first comprehensive survey of marine bioinvasions in the southern Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA, ca. 33°45′–ca. 54°50′S) published in 2002 reported 31 introduced and 46 cryptogenic species. In this assessment, we update this work by providing a deep historical perspective of marine biological invasions as well as a full new review of introductions that have occurred over the past nearly two decades. We reviewed a variety of sources including peer-reviewed journals and monographs, government reports, and museum databases, among others. The previous survey was re-evaluated and taxonomic experts were also consulted. For each species, the possible status as introduced or cryptogenic, likely vector, likely native region, first collection date if known, and the first authoritative reference of its SWA occurrence were determined. Species were categorized by biogeographical provinces. Our reevaluation of species status lowered the 2002 survey to 29 introduced and 29 cryptogenic species. The result of our analyses added 100 new introduced and 43 new cryptogenic species, making a total of 129 introduced and 72 cryptogenic marine species for the SWA. Of these 100 species, 67 were found in the literature older than the 2002 survey, and 33 were found as new invasions that occurred since 2002, averaging one new invasion every 178 days. Ships are the most likely vector of invasions with an additional few species introduced with aquaculture, for ornamental purposes or for stabilizing coastal dunes. Most species are native to either the North Pacific or North Atlantic Oceans. Most introduced species (51%) occur in the warm temperate SWA marine ecoregion, while fewer (16%) occur in the cold temperate Magellanic marine ecoregion. Since ships are the main vectors in the region, we forecast that new introductions will continue until regional and international regulations to control ballast water and hull fouling begin to be effective. Our results urge the creation of long-term assessment programs focused on marine coastal biodiversity as a way to avoid inefficient environmental management based on deficient baseline information.","Schwindt, E.; Carlton, J.T.; Orensanz, J.M.; Scarabino, F.; Bortolus, A.",,"Orensanz, José, J.M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"biological invasions, Argentina, Uruguay, maritime history, shipping",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes spatial and temporal variability of productivity in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) relating to hilsa fishery. Decadal data on net primary productivity, nutrients (i.e. nitrate, phosphate and silicate) and zooplankton were collected from Aqua MODIS, world ocean database and COPEPOD respectively with spatial resolution 1°×1°. Moreover, monthly abundance of phytoplankton, hilsa catch and long-term catch dynamics were analyzed to determine the associations between variables. The present study was extended over 3.568 million km<sup>2</sup> area, of which 0.131–0.213 million km<sup>2</sup> area characterized as the most productive with net primary production of &gt;2,000 mg C/m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.373–0.861 million km<sup>2</sup> area as moderately productive with 500–2,000 mg C/m<sup>2</sup>/day, and 2.517–3.040 million km<sup>2</sup> area as the least productive with &lt;500 mg C/m<sup>2</sup>/day which were consistent with field verification data. In case of nutrients, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta was rich in nitrate and phosphate than that of the Ayeyarwady delta, while silicate concentration persisted high all over the northern BoB including the deltas. A peak abundance of phytoplankton was observed in GBM delta during the months of August-November, when ~80% of total hilsa are harvested in Bangladesh annually. Variations in seasonal productivity linked with nutrients and phytoplankton abundance are important factors for predicting hilsa habitat and their migration patterns in the deltaic regions and shelf waters of BoB. These results can be useful in forecasting potential responses of the hilsa in BoB ecosystem to changing global ocean productivity.","Hossain, M.S.; Sarker, S.; Sharifuzzaman, S.M.; Chowdhury, S.R.",WOS:000560409100013,"Sarker, Subrata, S.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/s41598-020-62616-5,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Chittagong, Inst Marine Sci, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh.",Bangladesh,,SHAD TENUALOSA-ILISHA; FRESH-WATER DISCHARGE; SALMON SALMO-SALAR; BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY; COASTAL WATERS; WESTERN BAY; PHYSICAL PROCESSES; CARRYING-CAPACITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-SEA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

Here we use a conservation planning algorithm to integrate 55 global data layers on ABNJ species diversity, habitat heterogeneity, benthic features, productivity, and fishing as a means for highlighting priority regions in ABNJ to be considered for spatial protection. We also include information on forecasted species distributions under climate change. We found that parameterizing the planning algorithm to protect at least 30% of these key ABNJ conservation features, while avoiding areas of high fishing effort, yielded a solution that highlights 52,545,634 km<sup>2</sup> (23.7%) of ABNJ as high priority regions for protection. Instructing the planning model to avoid ABNJ areas with high fishing effort resulted in relatively minor shifts in the planning solution, when compared to a separate model that did not consider fishing effort. Integrating information on climate change had a similarly minor influence on the planning solution, suggesting that climate-informed ABNJ protected areas may be able to protect biodiversity now and in the future. This globally standardized, data-driven process for identifying priority ABNJ regions for protection serves as a valuable complement to other expert-driven processes underway to highlight ecologically or biologically significant ABNJ regions. Both the outputs and methods exhibited in this analysis can additively inform UN decision-making concerning establishment of ABNJ protected areas.","Visalli, M.E.; Best, B.D.; Cabral, R.B.; Cheung, W.W.L.; Clark, N.A.; Garilao, C.; Kaschner, K.; Kesner-Reyes, K.; Lam, V.W.Y.; Maxwell, S.M.; Mayorga, J.; Moeller, H.V.; Morgan, L.; Ortuño Crespo, G.; Pinsky, M.L.; White, T.D.; McCauley, D.J.",WOS:000598174400013,"Moeller, Holly, H.V.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103927,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Biodiversity; Conservation planning; Areas beyond national jurisdiction; High seas; Marine protected areas; Climate change,Journal article,,,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Mail Code 6150, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",USA,Biodiversity; Conservation planning; Areas beyond national jurisdiction; High seas; Marine protected areas; Climate change,GLOBAL OCEAN; HIGH SEAS; BIODIVERSITY; TRACKING; RESERVES; GOVERNANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; CONNECTIVITY; CONVENTION; CHALLENGES,Environmental Studies; International Relations,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,University of California Santa Barbara,x,USA,,University,Science

Freshwater inputs create strong environmental gradients, which potentially affect the community structure of benthic infauna. In turn, changes in functional trait composition have the potential to affect the processing of terrestrially-derived nutrients and organic matter along the freshwater to marine continuum. We investigated the effects of riverine inputs on benthic community structure, functional traits, taxonomic and functional diversity, and on utilization of terrestrial organic matter in two contrasting northern Norwegian fjords. Results of this study revealed extensive impacts of riverine inputs on community structure and functional traits. Communities directly affected by the river were characterized by diminished taxonomic and functional diversity, with species and trait composition indicative of an environment influenced by high sedimentation rates. Large, deep-dwelling, biodiffusors and upward conveyors dominated these communities. High community biomass at the river outlet as well as indications of terrestrial organic matter utilization evidenced by stable isotope analyses, suggest that such river-influenced communities may be important for the cycling of terrestrial carbon and nutrients in the coastal zone.","McGovern, M.; Poste, A.; Oug, E.; Renaud, P.E.; Trannum, H.C.",WOS:000535863600015,"McGovern, Maeve, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106774,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Tromsoy I.,,"Biodiversity, ""Macrobenthos""",,"Stable isotopes, Riverine inputs, Terrestrial organic matter,  Biological traits analysis, Målselvfjord",Journal article,,,"NIVA, Fram Ctr, Hjalmar Johansens Gate 14, NO-9007 Tromso, Norway.",Norway,Macrobenthos; Stable isotopes; Biodiversity; Riverine inputs; Terrestrial organic matter; Biological traits analysis; Norway; Troms; Malselvfjord,NORWEGIAN COASTAL WATERS; SOFT-BOTTOM MACROFAUNA; ORGANIC-CARBON BURIAL; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; NORTHERN NORWAY; SEA; DIVERSITY,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,,,,,,

Spermatozoa of <i>A. islandica</i> consist of (in anterior to posterior sequence): an elongate-conical, deeply invaginated, acrosomal vesicle (length 2.0 ± 0.2 μm; invagination occupied by a granular subacrosomal material); a straight, anteriorly-tapered, rod-shaped nucleus (length 6.6 ± 0.4 μm); a short (approximately 0.8 μm) midpiece consisting of two orthogonally arranged centrioles, surrounded by four (approximately 75% of spermatozoa observed) or, less commonly, five (approximately 25% of spermatozoa observed) spherical mitochondria; nine satellite fibres connecting the distal centriole to mitochondria and the plasma membrane; and a flagellum (length 60 ± 5.0 μm, with 9+2 axoneme), originating from the distal centriole. Contents of the acrosomal vesicle of <i>A. islandica</i> are differentiated into a very electron-dense basal ring (with reticulate structure) and two less electron-dense zones. Spermatozoa of <i>N. laevigatum</i> (Lamarck, 1819) differ substantially from those of <i>A. islandica</i> and are characterized by: a rounded-conical, deeply invaginated, acrosomal vesicle (length 0.43 ± 0.2 μm), with a curved basal ring and two less conspicuous components; a barrel-shaped nucleus (length 1.6 ± 0.5 μm) with a broad apical depression accommodating the base of the acrosomal vesicle; a midpiece composed of five (approximately 80% of spermatozoa observed) or four (approximately 20% of spermatozoa observed) mitochondria. Centriolar and flagellar details are essentially as for <i>A. islandica</i>, and putative glycogen deposits are associated with the distal centriole and mitochondria in both species. Sperm data corroborate recent transcriptomic analyses separating Arcticidae and Trapezidae in different imparidentian clades. Based on sperm morphology, <i>A. islandica</i> would appear more closely related to the Glauconomidae of the Cyrenoidea than to the Trapezidae, Veneroidea or any other previously examined group of euheterodonts, suggesting that it could be the only living member of the Arcticoidea. The relationships of the Trapezidae remain uncertain, with apparent sperm similarities to members of several groups of euheterodonts (e.g. Tellinoidea, Pholadoidea, Galeommatoidea), while several potentially closely related key taxa (e.g. Glossidae) remain unstudied for sperm characters.","Healy, J.M.; Mikkelsen, P.M.; Bieler, R.",WOS:000593087600002,"Mikkelsen, Paula, P.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/mollus/eyaa002,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",Australia,,FINE-STRUCTURE; FUNCTIONAL-MORPHOLOGY; SEXUAL MATURITY; COMPARATIVE SPERMATOLOGY; TEMPORARY-ACROSOME; SEMINAL RECEPTACLE; DIMORPHIC SPERM; MOLLUSCA; SPERMATOGENESIS; GALEOMMATOIDEA,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,University of Queensland,x,Australia,,University,Science

The scientific evidence supporting the use of marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve biodiversity stems primarily from knowledge on fully protected areas, but most of what is being established is partially protected. Here, we assess the protection levels of the 1,062 Mediterranean MPAs. While 6.01% of the Mediterranean is covered by protection, 95% of this area shows no difference between the regulations imposed inside the MPAs compared with those outside. Full and high levels of protection, the most effective for biodiversity conservation, represent only 0.23% of the basin and are unevenly distributed across political boundaries and eco-regions. Our current efforts are insufficient at managing human uses of nature at sea, and protection levels should be increased to deliver tangible benefits for biodiversity conservation.","Claudet, J.; Loiseau, C.; Sostres, M.; Zupan, M.",,"Claudet, Joachim, J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.03.008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, benthic communities are under stress due to anthropogenic influences such as habitat alterations, overexploitation and pollution. To be able to anticipate on such changes, monitoring the benthic diversity in a consistent and reliable way is essential. Traditional methods for measuring biodiversity, using morphological taxonomy of individual specimens, is time-consuming and requires specialized taxonomic knowledge. In the past decade, molecular tools and more specific DNA metabarcoding has emerged as an alternative method for species identification. In this thesis I explored the application of metabarcoding methods to assess marine benthic biodiversity.The work I presented in this thesis showed that metabarcoding is a valuable approach to assess anthropogenic effects on marine benthic communities. Compared to traditional morphological taxonomy, the metabarcoding approach gave comparable outcomes regarding the impact of anthropogenic influences. Moreover, the metabarcoding approach was able to include more taxa in the assessment and hence increase the power of the analysis. However, the metabarcoding approach also has limitations compared to the traditional approach. For instance, quantitative analyses are limited and gaps in the reference library can lead to misidentifications of taxa. Nonetheless, rapid developments are still made for the metabarcoding approach and molecular approaches in general. These developments may soon overcome many of the limitations and will probably increase the value of this approach even further.","Klunder, L.",,"Klunder, Lise, L.",,https://hdl.handle.net/11370/aacbff17-cf50-4a88-8889-b14ed0e82392,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,
