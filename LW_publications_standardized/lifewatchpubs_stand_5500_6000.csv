Distinct dead BF assemblages were determined using multivariate statistical analyses, reflecting ecological preferences and their association with different environmental settings. The dead BF assemblages investigated in the current study were significantly different from the living BF assemblages explored in a previous study at the same stations. Ongoing human activity may explain these discrepancies, especially in the middle shelf, where continuous grain size coarsening, increase in carbonate content and decrease in TOC have occurred since the construction of the Aswan High Dam across the Nile River. These changes comprise (I) modest but clear changes in the lateral distribution of the biotopes, including continuous southward retreat of the southern middle shelf Nilotic biotope, and appearance of more fragmented, small biotopes due to the reduced impact of the Nile littoral cell; (II) dissimilarities in assemblage composition with higher numbers of opportunistic species occurring in the dead assemblages and increasing densities of sensitive taxa in the living assemblages.","Avnaim-Katav, S.; Almogi-Labin, A.; Herut, B.; Kanari, M.; Guy-Haim, T.",,"Kanari, Mor, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marmicro.2021.101977,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Foraminifera,,,"Southeastern Levantine shelf, Eastern Mediterranean, Nile River damming, Dead and living benthic foraminifera, Taphonomy, Ecological indicators ",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the increasing threat from climate change and sea-level rise, the armouring of coastlines, to withstand coastal erosion, has become common practice. The transformation of soft sediment habitats to hard, artificial habitats can lead to changes in species diversity, composition and distribution. As there is limited information regarding the ecological impacts of using Reno mattresses (wire mattresses filled with rocks) to combat erosion, this study investigated the faunistic differences of these structures compared to natural eelgrass (<i>Zostera capensis</i>) habitat in the Keurbooms estuary, South Africa. Benthic macroinvertebrate and fish abundances and assemblages were assessed seasonally from winter 2018 to spring 2019. Macroinvertebrates were assessed using standard core and suction sampling whereas the non-destructive method of mini Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVs) was used to sample fish. Fish assemblages differed significantly between habitats and across seasons with greater abundances and diversity at the artificial structures compared to eelgrass habitat. Invertebrate taxa displayed some overlap between habitats, however, three higher taxonomic groups were only recorded within Reno mattress habitat with only one taxon unique to the eelgrass habitat.

Net diversity (expressed as species, genus and family richness) and β-diversity (as species, genus and family turnover) reveal several major disruptive phases. Turnovers occurred at the Ypresian–Lutetian and Eocene–Oligocene boundaries, and extinction events took place at the Oligocene–Miocene, Burdigalian–Langhian and Pliocene–Pleistocene boundaries. These biotic shifts correlate largely with global climatic events such as the Ypresian–Lutetian transition from Hothouse to Warmhouse, the Oi-1 glaciation at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary and with the onset of the Pleistocene glacials at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. Phases of diversification during the Lutetian, Burdigalian and Pliocene seem to be linked to phases of relative climate stability. At least five immigration events are reflected by the appearance of exotic elements in European faunas during the Ypresian, Bartonian, Rupelian, Burdigalian and Langhian. Many of them correlate with the formation of terrestrial pathways and major migration events in mammals.

Poor live-dead (LD) fidelity in molluscan assemblages may result from transport-induced mixing. Large-scale mixing is more common in siliciclastic settings with a narrow shelf, high sedimentation rate, and those that are frequented by episodically high-energy events. Chandipur-on-sea, on the east coast of India has an optimal setting to promote such conditions. By studying the LD fidelity and modeling size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the fauna, we attempted to evaluate the contribution of “out-of-habitat” versus “within-habitat” mixing in developing the molluscan death assemblage. The correlation between the composition of live (LA) and death assemblages (DA) was insufficient; unlike LAs, the DAs do not show environmental partitioning in ordination space. A numerical simulation of the shell size frequency distribution (SFD) for DAs from LAs was compared with the observed SFD of the DAs. The results of this simulation indicate that DAs are not likely to be a product of within-habitat mixing. DAs probably received considerable input via regional transport, facilitated by frequent tropical cyclones affecting the coast of Odisha. Chandipur receives a large proportion of cyclones originating above 15°N, which causes a high degree of lateral transport and shell mixing between 15° to 21°N, explained by the high compositional similarity of species within this latitudinal extent. Our study highlights the significance of out-of-habitat transport in shaping the regional distribution of marine fossil assemblages, especially in storm dominated siliciclastic shallow-marine settings.","Bhattacherjee, M.; Chattopadhyay, D.; Som, B.; Sankar, A.S.; Mazumder, S.",,"Som, Bidisha, B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2020.020,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We obtained a hierarchical grouping of sub-ecoregions and the respective list of species that significantly support each cluster. We also developed two new analytical resources: a radial plot for showing the species composition of clusters resolved at three taxonomic levels, and a mixed coefficient of distributional size useful to identify SRE from sparse point records. This dimensionless measure of spatial range combines information of both the convex hull area and the length of the minimum spanning tree connecting point localities of presence. The Southern Andean Yungas and Dry Chaco are the species-level richest ecoregions. Although the Paranaense Forest harbors half of the number of species found in the Chaco Serrano, it reaches the highest score of taxonomic diversity because of the eclectic nature of their genera. SRE species are not randomly distributed across the sub-ecoregions, but they broadly overlap with the orographic Peripampasic arc extended over Chaco Serrano and Yungas Forests. SREs are highly dependent on the physical nature of the landscape.","Dos Santos, D.A.; Domínguez, E.; Miranda, M.J.; Gutiérrez Gregoric, D.E.; Cuezzo, M.G.",,"Dos Santos, D.A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133320948839,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Sub-ecoregion similarity, distributional ranges, taxonomic diversity, Peripampasic arc, Dry Chaco",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we provided an updated list of NIS introduced into Adriatic Sea by shipping as pathway, the most likely vectors of introduction, country of first detection, year, origin, establishing success and invasive characteristics. In total, 127 NIS were identified as the most probably introduced by maritime shipping into the Adriatic Sea. Rhodophyta, Arthropoda and Annelida represents almost 50% of all the listed species. The highest number of NIS introduced likely by shipping has been identified for period from 2001 to 2010 year. More than 73% of NIS listed for the first time in the Adriatic Sea were recorded in Italy. Half of listed NIS (50%) were probably introduced by external ship’s vector i.e. boat hull fouling (BHF). Majority of these species were classified as established. Screening of the potential risk of NIS being invasive in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea has not been done systematically, and for the most of NIS has never been performed. Increased number of sailing, motor recreational boats and cruise ships, lack on solutions for biofouling suppression and lack on regulations for anchoring may intensify NIS introductions by shipping as the most probable pathway into Adriatic Sea. That could become serious threat for native biodiversity and natural heritage, and it needs to be taken seriously by all relevant organisations and stakeholders.","Sliškovic, M.; Piria, M.; Nerlovic, V.; Ivelja, K.P.; Gavrilovic, A.; Mrcelic, G.J.",,"Piria, Marina, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104516,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Pathway, Stowaway, Shipping, NIS, Inventory, Adriatic Sea",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is meaningful and important to elucidate the life origins by exploring the origin and adaptive genetic mechanisms of the large deep-sea organisms. Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) are abundant and economically important group of echinoderms, living from the shallow-waters to deep-sea. In this study, we present the mitochondrial genomes of the sea cucumber <i>Chiridota heheva</i> and <i>Chiridota</i> sp. collected from the deep-sea cold seep and hydrothermal vent, respectively. This is the first reported mitochondrial genomes from the order Apodida. The mitochondrial genomes of <i>C. heheva</i> (17,200 bp) and <i>Chiridota</i> sp. (17,199 bp) display novel gene arrangements with the first protein-coding gene rearrangements in the class Holothuroidea. Bases composition analysis showed that the A + T content of deep-sea holothurians were significantly higher than that of the shallow-water groups. We compared the arrangement of genes from the 24 available holothurian mitogenomes and found that the transposition, reverse transposition and tandem-duplication-random-losses (TDRL) may be involved in the evolution of mitochondrial gene arrangements in Holothuroidea. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Apodida clustered with Elasipodida, forming two basal deep-sea holothurian clades. The divergence between the deep-sea and shallow-water holothurians was located at 386.93 Mya, during the Late Devonian.

The present study includes deep-sea trawling operations and represents the first analysis in detail of the deep-sea community of decapod crustaceans. Cluster analysis of bottom trawl data indicated that benthic megafauna are grouped in four bathymetric ranges along the continental margin: A, 250 > 1100 m; B, 1100 > 2000 m; C, 2000 > 3000 m; and D, 3000–3800 m, while pelagic species are not grouped by depth strata. The decapod individuals belong to 79 different species from which 64% correspond to shrimps (suborder Dendrobranchiata and infraorder Caridea), and the third most important group corresponds to the infraorder Anomura (18%). From those, previously 67% were not reported off Uruguay and 47% in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The bathymetric range of the identified decapods was enlarged by 32%. Moreover, the frequency distribution of species occurrences was rare since 56% of the species were only sampled once, thus indicating that the decapod community of this area is still far unknown. The benthic species were also more diverse than the pelagic decapods, and their abundance and biomass were higher. The biomass of the decapod community was dominated by the geryonid crab, Chaceon notialis, mainly located in the shallowest depth strata (representing 97% of the total biomass). To detect possible changes in the structure, biomass, and diversity of benthic assemblages, we recommend the implementation of long-term monitoring programs in the continental slope off Uruguay before fishing or mining exploitation is developed.","Rotllant, G.; Verdi, A.; Santos-Bethencourt, R.; Bahamón, N.; Company, J.B.",,"Verdi, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58410-8_19,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Crustacea, ""Decapoda""",,,Crustaceans; Deep sea; Shannon index; Equity index of Pielou; Species richness; Conservation,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used multiple statistical methods to explore the mechanisms driving phytoplankton and zooplankton metacommunity dynamics at the regional scale in the Bohai Sea, China. Clear geographic patterns were observed in both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Zooplankton showed a stronger distance-decay of similarity than phytoplankton, which had greater community differences between locations with further distances. Our analyses indicated that the zooplankton communities were primarily governed by species sorting versus dispersal limitation than the phytoplankton communities. Furthermore, we detected that zooplankton exhibited wider habitat niche breadths and dispersal abilities than phytoplankton. Our findings also showed that environmental pollution affected high trophic organisms via food webs; the presence of heavy metals in the Bohai Sea altered the abundance of some phytoplankton, and thus modified the zooplankton that feed on them.","Zhao, Z.; Li, H.; Sun, Y.; Yang, Q.; Fan, J.",,"Zhao, Zelong, Z.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117256,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Distance-decay of similarity, Marine compartments, Species sorting, Dispersal limitation, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some fossil species possessed large bioconstructional colonies that would have provided habitats for other marine animals and plants, just as similar colonies do at the present day. Today, biogenic calcareous structures vary greatly in size, ranging from a few centimetres to many kilometres, and in complexity, forming composite structures that are distributed globally. Despite the role of bioconstructional bryozoan species in promoting marine biodiversity worldwide, they have been excluded from several protection strategies. Information emerging from the literature provides only a very incomplete picture of the role of bryozoans as bioconstructors at the global level. The ability of bryozoans to form long-lasting carbonate structures makes them important carbonate producers, with a significant role in the carbon cycle. Bryozoan reefs are facing the challenges of climate change, which will be detrimental for some species and their associated biota. Better knowledge of the contribution of bryozoans to the carbon stock and the ecosystem services they provide will be of great importance to ensure their protection and to understand their potential in adaptation strategies under future ocean scenarios.","Lombardi, C.; Taylor, P.D.; Cocito, S.",,"Taylor, P.D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57054-5_7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bryozoa,,,Bryozoan bioconstructions; Biodiversity; Fossil and recent bioconstructors; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Conservation,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reviewed and assessed published research on: the fisheries and aquaculture; taxonomy and identification; distribution and habitat preferences; growth; mortality; food and feeding; predation, and the importance of the mangrove habitat to banana prawns. We have examined the life history patterns of these two banana prawns and the many environmental and biological factors that affect different life history stages, often resulting in large interannual variations in abundances of adult prawns and commercial catches. We have also reviewed research on the ecosystem relationships involving these prawns, including fishery impacts on the environment and other species caught as bycatch. In reviewing the published information on factors affecting recruitment dynamics and variability, we have sometimes found contrasting and confounding results, suggesting that these factors are not yet fully understood. Therefore, for each aspect of the prawns' biology we have pointed to areas with incomplete or conflicted understanding, which will hopefully guide future research on these extremely valuable prawn species.","Vance, D.J.; Rothlisberg, P.C.",,"Vance, David, D.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.amb.2020.04.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Penaeus indicus, ""Penaeus merguiensis""",,,Life history; Fisheries; Aquaculture; Mangroves; Environment; Ecosystem; Taxonomy; Growth and mortality; Feeding; Predation,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The review includes more than 620 studies published worldwide from 1962 to 2018. In general, publications on artificial reefs have focused on investigating the ability for artificial reefs to attract fishing resources and on constructing artificial reef structures with new materials. Artificial reef science has made significant advances in recent decades with the increased use of more elaborate construction methods and data analyses. Nevertheless, the field has encountered difficulties in minimizing the negative effects of some materials, filling gaps in socio-economic data, developing integrated management assessments and overcoming regional inequalities. There are promising opportunities to overcome these obstacles that depend on the development of inert materials, an increase in the number of long-term and large-scale studies, the regulation of an evaluation protocol, the development of conservation policies and investments in scientific dissemination. We hope that this systematic review can not only advance artificial reef science but also provide important information for overcoming obstacles to the future development of this topic.","Lima, J.S.; Zalmon, I.R.",,"Lima, Juliano, J.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9780429328039-3,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the estimated 26,000 malacostracan species described, about 6,000 inhabit a plethora of freshwater habitats worldwide. The Mediterranean Region has been recognized as one of the 25 most important biodiversity and endemism hotspots and its islands are considered to be natural laboratories of evolution. Even though the Mediterranean Region contains roughly 6% of freshwater malacostracan taxa, knowledge about the freshwater fauna of this area is incomplete and studies are scarce. Here we provide, arguably, the first extensive study on the freshwater malacostracan fauna of the Mediterranean Islands. The Mediterranean Island freshwater houses 182 species in five orders (Amphipoda, Isopoda, Thermosbaenacea, Bathynellacea, Decapoda), representing 51 genera and 27 families. More than half are endemic. Even though the islands cover only about 5% of the Mediterranean Region area and about 0.2% of the whole Palearctic, the overall number of species corresponds to 25% of all malacostracan species reported from the region and more than 8% of Palearctic species. The number of reported insular species is high, and we expect this number will grow. However, freshwater biota extinction rates may be much higher than terrestrial organisms. Planning reasonable and efficient strategies to protect local, especially endemic, freshwater fauna are urgently needed.","Hupalo, K.; Stoch, F.; Karaouzas, I.; Wysocka, A.; Rewicz, T.; Mamos, T.; Grabowski, M.",,"Hupalo, Kamil, K.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Malacostraca,,,,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pre-Monsoon [(PRM) (March–May)] macrobenthic community was dominated by gastropods, which transformed into a less diverse and hypoxia adapted opportunistic species of polychaetes (<i>Paraprionospio pinnata</i> and <i>Cossura coasta</i>) and foraminifers (<i>Bolivina</i> sp.) during the SWM. This study showed a seasonal decline of the sensitive fauna and the dominance of opportunistic species as the effect of hypoxia in the study area during the SWM.","Pandiya rajan, R.S.; Jyothibabu, R.; Arunpandi, N.; Jagadeesan, L.; Santhi Krishnan, S.; Parthasarathi, S.",,"Pandiya rajan, R.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2021.104450,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Macrobenthos, Hypoxia, Coastal upwellinig, Southwest coast India, Arabian sea",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct observations via SCUBA diving combined with active and remote video demonstrated that <i>O. vulgaris</i> was primarily nocturnal, foraged on hard bottom substrate, and consumed mostly bivalves while <i>M. defilippi</i> was strictly diurnal, foraged on soft bottom substrate, and consumed exclusively crustaceans. Both species showed a saltatory (stop and go) foraging tactic dominated by speculative bottom searching, which is guided by visual scanning and decision making, followed by tactile endeavors of the arms and chemotactile suckers. Species-specific behaviors were parachute attack (<i>O. vulgaris</i>), mimicry of flounder swimming (<i>M. defilippi</i>), and tripod stance (<i>M. defilippi</i>).

The complex taxonomy of Nematoda is primarily based on morphology, which is often dubious. DNA barcoding emerged as a handy tool to identify specimens and assess diversity, but its applications in Nematoda are incipient. We evaluated cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit I (<i>cox1</i>) efficiency as a DNA barcode for nematodes scrutinising 5241 sequences retrieved from BOLD and GenBank. The samples included genera with medical, agricultural, or ecological relevance: <i>Anguillicola</i>, <i>Caenorhabditis</i>, <i>Heterodera</i>, <i>Meloidogyne</i>, <i>Onchocerca</i>, <i>Strongyloides</i>, and <i>Trichinella</i>. We assessed <i>cox1</i> performance through barcode gap and Probability of Correct Identification (PCI) analyses, and estimated species richness through Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD). Each genus presented distinct gap ranges, mirroring the evolutionary diversity within Nematoda. Thus, to survey the diversity of the phylum, a careful definition of thresholds for lower taxonomic levels should be considered. PCIs were around 70% for both databases, highlighting operational biases and challenges in nematode taxonomy. ABGD inferred higher richness than the taxonomic labels informed by databases. The prevalence of specimen misidentifications and dubious species delimitations emphasise the value of integrative approaches to nematode taxonomy and systematics. Overall, <i>cox1</i> is a relevant tool for integrative taxonomy of nematodes.","Gonçalves, L.T.; Bianchi, F.M.; Deprá, M.; Calegaro-Marques, C.",,"Gonçalves, Leonardo, L.T.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2020-0140,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although refined by evolution for interaction with target prey receptors, enhancements of pharmacological properties are needed for use in mammalian systems. Therefore, we synthesized analogues of α-conotoxin RgIA using a combination of selective penicillamine substitutions together with natural and non-natural amino acid replacements. This approach resulted in a peptide with 9000-fold increased potency on the human α9α10 nAChR and improved resistance to disulfide shuffling compared to the native peptide. The lead analogue, RgIA-5474, potently blocked α9α10 nAChRs, but not opioid- or other pain-related targets. In addition, RgIA-5474 effectively reversed chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.","Gajewiak, J.; Christensen, S.B.; Dowell, C.; Hararah, F.; Fisher, F.; Huynh, P.N.; Olivera, B.M.; McIntosh, J.M.",,"Olivera, Baldomero, B.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00512,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ca 6400-220 cal yr B.P. hydroclimatic record of two lakes viz Tsoltak lake and Yaya Tso near the Chang La and Hor La passes of Ladakh Range is presented here. The overall record (mineral magnetic analysis and microbiota) from the Ladakh range shows wetter conditions ca 6400 cal yr BP consistently declining till ~5000 cal yr BP and moderately wet and stable till ~4300 cal yr BP, followed by an arid cold phase (~4300-4000 cal yr BP). This precedes two moderately wet phases (ca 4300-3500 cal yr BP and ca 1260-220 cal yr BP) and the peak arid conditions between 3500 and 2860 cal yr B P and 2230-855 cal yr BP, which may have affected the trade activities and had an adverse affect of cultural transitions during these periods across the Ladakh Range on the to and fro movements from this northern sub-route branch. The biotic assemblage is rich in Non Pollen Palynomorphs (76%) with minor amounts of pollens (24%). An improvement in the conditions since 855 cal yr BP and thereafter from 340 to 220 cal yr BP records the onset of the cold arid conditions again in the Ladakh Range. Presently due to contemporary deglaciation the Ladakh Range is becoming ice free and a number of lakes surrounded by herbaceous meadows are seen in the area due to glacial melt, likely to encourage the human settlements to soon occupy the higher reaches that will negatively affect the natural lake productivity.","Joshi, P.; Phartiyal, B.; Joshi, M.",,"Joshi, Mallickarjun, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.053,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Trans-Himalaya; Ladakh range; Glacial lake; Hydroclimate; Silk route sub-branch,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This index identifies positive (low emissions, large temperature shifts) and negative disparity regions (high emissions, small temperature shifts), with global coverage. Across all climate change projections we analyzed, 99% of the earth’s surface area has a positive index value. This result underscores that while emissions are geographically concentrated, warming is globally widespread. From our index, the regions of the greatest positive disparity appear concentrated in the polar arctic, Central Asia, and Africa with negative disparity regions in western Europe, Southeast Asia, and eastern North America.

At each station (48 nearshore and 25 offshore), we measured vertical profiles of temperature, oxygen, phytoplankton biomass and composition, inorganic nutrients, and particulate organic carbon, particulate nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P).</li>                                    <li>Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in 2018–2019 were 10.3 ± 7.1 and 2.8 ± 1.1  µg/L in the nearshore and offshore surface waters, respectively, close to those measured in the 1960s before eutrophication, but distinctly lower than those measured in the 1990s (71 ± 100 and 14 ± 6  µg/L). The phytoplankton of Lake Victoria in 2018–2019 still appears dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria. However, we observed more non-heterocystous filamentous and coccal/colonial cyanobacteria taxa that are better adapted to mixing conditions than gas-vacuolated heterocystous taxa, which were dominant in the 1990s. Particulate N was significantly lower in 2018–2019 than in the 1990s, indicative of less efficient N fixation. The dissolved silica concentrations in 2018–2019 were significantly higher with the concomitant reappearance of <i>Aulacoseira</i> spp., which was not observed in the 1990s, presumably due to low dissolved silica concentrations.            </li>                                    <li>As data from long-term monitoring are absent, the reasons for the lower chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations in 2018–2019 compared to the 1990s are unclear. However, climatic controls (El Niño/La Niña conditions) may be an important factor influencing the historical trend in chlorophyll-<i>a</i>. Higher wind in 2018–2019 promoted vertical mixing, resulting in a deeper thermocline and surface mixed layers, which eventually lowered phytoplankton production in comparison to the 1990s. In contrast, the thermocline and surface mixed layers in the 1990s were shallower, enabling phytoplankton to stay suspended in the upper well illuminated water, allowing greater productivity. The lake in 2018–2019 is still P saturated, suggesting that another episode of high chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentrations could develop if less windy conditions occur in future, or if continued warming of surface waters eventually overcomes the mixing from present windy conditions.            </li>                                    <li>This study gives insights about the present ecological functioning of Lake Victoria and emphasises the impacts of variations in climate on lake physics that changes the light environment for phytoplankton. A possible less windy period in the future resulting from a new El Niño phase or from climate change, will probably lead to another episode of eutrophication in Lake Victoria. As in 2018–2019 the lake was still saturated by nutrients, there is need to reduce the nutrient concentrations (especially P) to prevent future destructive eutrophic periods caused by reduced mixing.</li>","Deirmendjian, L.; Descy, J.-P.; Morana, C.; Okello, W.; Stoyneva-Gartner, M.P.; Bouillon, S.; Borges, A.V.",,"Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya, M.P.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13780,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the scarcity of natural archives, South Africa's environmental evolution during the late Quaternary remains highly debated. Many available sediment archives are peri-coastal lakes and wetlands; however, the paleoenvironmental signals in these archives are often overprinted by sea-level changes during the Holocene. This study presents a new record from the coastal wetland Voëlvlei, which is situated in the year-round rainfall zone of South Africa on the southern Cape coast. It presents an ideal sedimentary archive to investigate both sea level and environmental changes. A 13 m long sediment core was retrieved and analysed using a multi-proxy approach. The chronology reveals a basal age of 8440 +200/−250 cal BP. Paleoecological and elemental analyses indicate marine incursions from ca. 8440 to ca. 7000 cal BP with a salinity optimum occurring at 7090 +170/−200 cal BP. At ca. 6000 cal BP, the basin of Voëlvlei was in-filled with sediment resulting in an intermittent (sporadically desiccated) freshwater lake similar to present.    In contrast to previous investigations which used indirect proxies for hydrological reconstructions, here we apply a combined biomarker–sedimentological approach that allows the potential identification of precipitation sources, in combination with relative estimates of moisture availability. Increasing moisture is observed throughout the record starting from 8440 +200/−250 cal BP with contributions from both westerlies and easterlies from ca. 8440 to ca. 7070 cal BP. Westerly-derived rainfall dominates from ca. 7070 to ca. 6420 cal BP followed by a distinct shift to an easterly dominance at ca. 6420 cal BP. An overall trend to westerly dominance lasting until ca. 2060 cal BP is followed by a trend towards an easterly dominance to the present, but both phases show several intense, short-term variations. These variations are also evident in other regional studies, highlighting that the source and seasonality of precipitation has varied distinctly on the southern Cape during the Holocene. Comparison of the Voëlvlei record with other regional studies suggests a coherent trend in the overall moisture evolution along the southern Cape coast during the past 8500 years.","Strobel, P.; Bliedtner, M.; Carr, A.S.; Frenzel, P.; Klaes, B.; Salazar, G.; Struck, J.; Szidat, S.; Zech, R.; Haberzettl, T.",,"Haberzettl, Torsten, T.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1567-2021,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explore current strategies to understand how to better communicate risks associated with HABs to the public. Our team conducted an environmental scan on provincial and territorial government agency protocols around HABs. Results suggest that there are variations in the monitoring, managing, and communicating of risk to the public: British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec have well-established inter-agency protocols, and most provinces report following federal guidelines for water quality. Notably, 3 northern territories have no HABs monitoring or management protocols in place. More populous provinces use a variety of information venues (websites, social media, on site postings, and radio) to communicate risks associated with HABs, whereas others’ communications are limited. To induce more collaboration on HABs monitoring and management and reduce the associated risks, creating a coherent system with consistent messaging and inter-agency communication is suggested.","Rashidi, H.; Baulch, H.; Gill, A.; Bharadwaj, L.; Bradford, L.",,"Rashidi, Hamidreza, H.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/11786302211014401,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Harmful algal blooms, environmental scanning, blue-green algae surveillance, risk communications, environmental monitoring, Canada",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use a new compilation of 22 fossil localities in California that have been reliably dated to MIS 5e to establish baseline expectations for contemporary bivalve species movements by identifying and analyzing bivalve species with “extralimital” ranges, that is, species that occupied the California region during MIS 5e but are now restricted to adjacent regions. We find that 15% of species (n = 142) found in MIS 5e localities have extralimital ranges and currently occupy warmer waters to the south of the California region. The majority of extralimital occurrences occur in paleo-embayments, suggesting that these sheltered habitats were more suitable habitats for warm-water species than exposed coasts during the MIS 5e. We further find that extralimital species now tend to occur in cooler, more seasonally productive coastal waters and to occupy more offshore islands when compared with the broader species pool immediately south of California. These findings suggest that high dispersal potential and preexisting tolerances to environmental conditions similar to California's comparatively cool and seasonally productive environments may have enabled extralimital bivalves to colonize the California region during MIS 5e.","Orzechowski, E.A.; Finnegan, S.",,"Finnegan, Seth, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/pab.2020.43,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Bivalvia,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 50 years later, microplastics are now one of the world’s most prevalent and forthcoming problems. Microplastics are fragments of plastic that are 5mm or smaller. They are formed from the degradation of larger pieces of plastic. Microplastics in the oceans and great lakes are a devastating problem. Microplastics move through the marine food web as they are ingested by animals and will inevitably reach humans. The health concerns from the ingestion of microplastics are still unknown and to this date are being studied. Although research has now begun to explore the subject of microplastics and their respectful extraction, there still remains a lack of solutions to remove microplastics, especially microplastics in the ocean. </p><p class="""" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Purpose</strong><br>A successful solution for the extraction of microplastics from the ocean must be both feasible and bio-friendly. In a search to meet those goals, we explored the potential utility of filter feeders to extract microplastics from the ocean.

In the Mexican Caribbean it is commonly found in cracks and crevices located where the vertical walls meet the sandy bottom or on large coral patches away from the sand. To protect themselves from predators, anemones often contract their hydraulic body into a cavernous den and extend the stinging tentacles toward the entrance. The high sediment dynamics of the region, however, result in a permanent risk of animal shelters to be obstructed by sand. By both analysing field data and conducting laboratory experiments with artificial shelters, the present study explored the den cleaning behaviour widely extended amongst alpheid shrimp, and its role in the alpheid-anemone symbiotic interaction. Videorecordings showed that den cleaning was composed of three main behaviours: digging, tossing and tamping. It commenced as soon as 7.2 ± 10.5 min after anemones were recognised by alpheids, and behaviours were displayed systematically amongst all 12 replicates. Despite being completely burrowed in sand, <i>Alpheus</i> spp. were capable of finding the anemone and liberating the entrance of the artificial shelters in less than 2.5 h. In addition, manipulative experiments showed that anemones confronted with shelters that were obstructed with sediment had a 25% probability of fully retracting when <i>Alpheus</i> spp. were absent, compared to a 75% probability when shrimps had cleaned the shelter’s entry and internal passage. The analysis of field data indicated that the presence of alpheid shrimps as symbionts of B. annulata was 30% higher amongst anemones in close contact with sandy bottoms than when inhabiting crevices on the top or lateral walls of hard substrates, away from the sediment. Overall, our study concludes that den cleaning constitutes a quick and effective mechanism to assure the anemone’s full retraction into their den, and by keeping the sediment away, alpheids provide the necessary conditions that serve both the anemone’s and the shrimp’s higher chances of acquiring maximum protection from predators. This advantageous exchange in protection partially explains why alpheids are more frequently present in <i>B. annulata</i> in interface microhabitats where the benefit of the interaction is maximised.","Pérez-Botello, A.M.; Mascaro, M.; Simões, N.",,"Pérez-Botello, Antar, A.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.677024,,"EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,Alpheus,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate probabilistic regression with natural gradient boosting. <i>arXiv (Archive) 2106.03823v1</i>","Many single-target regression problems require estimates of uncertainty along with the point predictions. Probabilistic regression algorithms are well-suited for these tasks. However, the options are much more limited when the prediction target is multivariate and a joint measure of uncertainty is required. For example, in predicting a 2D velocity vector a joint uncertainty would quantify the probability of any vector in the plane, which would be more expressive than two separate uncertainties on the x- and y- components. To enable joint probabilistic regression, we propose a Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) approach based on nonparametrically modeling the conditional parameters of the multivariate predictive distribution. Our method is robust, works out-of-the-box without extensive tuning, is modular with respect to the assumed target distribution, and performs competitively in comparison to existing approaches. We demonstrate these claims in simulation and with a case study predicting two-dimensional oceanographic velocity data.

Recognising the need for sustainable development, implementation of conservation and management measures in Tanzania's offshore waters has begun, with the development of coastal protected areas and marine spatial plans (e.g. the Coastal and Marine Spatial Plan for Zanzibar). As yet, the deeper areas of Tanzania have not been considered in marine spatial planning.

We also discuss the value and multiple uses of the deep ocean areas to Tanzania, and assess the ecological effects of impacts in these environments. This information is valuable to the Tanzanian government to help inform development of management measures to continue to make sustainable use of valuable deep-water resources.

In marine systems, where threats and biodiversity are inherently multidimensional and include vertical depth gradients, the designation of protected areas can be more challenging than in the terrestrial realm. Here, we aimed to evaluate the representation equality of biogeochemical regions at different depths in the Mediterranean Sea as a surrogate for biodiversity. We conducted a gap-analysis evaluating the current extent and coverage of protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea biodiversity hotspot to achieve an equitable representation and conservation strategy for the basin. We used biogeochemical regions across different depths, which allow more complex 3D marine spatial planning that includes spatial complexity of marine systems. A total of 60 biogeochemical regions distributed across three bathomes (spaces determined by depth; i.e. epipelagic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic zones) and the seafloor were assessed. We found that biogeochemical regions in the Mediterranean Sea were not equally protected across bathomes, and that global conservation targets were not met. The bathypelagic bathome had the lowest representation in the Mediterranean Sea marine protected area (MPA) network, as well as the lowest protection equality. The sub-basins with highest protection included the Algero-Provençal basin and the Tyrrhenian Sea. These two sub-basins were the only ones that passed the Aichi protection target of 10%, while all others were lower than the target. The Ionian Sea was identified as the most highly diverse sub-basin regarding biogeochemical regions but with the least protection and with low conservation equality, making this sub-basin a high priority for conservation. Amongst countries, non-European Mediterranean countries had lower values of protection and conservation equality metrics. In general, the bathypelagic bathome was found as the least protected, the most fragmented, and with the lowest protection equality, thus its protection should be enhanced through all the Mediterranean Sea. Decision makers in the Mediterranean can apply the gap-analysis approach presented here as a useful starting point for improving protection equality in the region, incorporating these metrics in the evaluation of new proposed protected areas and sites for conservation.","Giménez, J.; Venegas-Li, R.; Mazor, T.; Kark, S.; Levin, N.",,"Venegas-Li, Ruben, R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105747,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Gap analysis; 3D; Bioregionalization; Marine conservation; Marine planning,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is done by characterising it as a spatial conflict between the ship and the port, applied to the case of Amsterdam. This in turn uncovers factors that contribute to the current situation, and explains reasons for intervention or a lack thereof through motivations and barriers of both local authorities and the cruising industry. These motivations and barriers are explored through literature review, policy review, and the analysis of conducted interviews. The identified barriers are a lack of authority of the port over the cruising industry, cost of potential interventions and investment risk, and the external benefits that cruise ships offer to a port. Motivations are the external costs of air pollution and tourism. These two are subject to discussion, indicating that the impacts of tourism and air pollution are subjective in nature. This is also shown in the other identified motivation, which is public opinion on the matter. As a result, motivations are a matter of subjectivity, whereas barriers are determined by much more rigid investment costs.","Wieringa, R.",,"Wieringa, Ruben, R.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impacts of domestic shipping can affect different populations, and domestic and international shipping emissions are governed under different regulatory systems. Thus, a consistent global analysis comparing the health impacts from domestic and international shipping could inform policy making in attempts to coordinate policies across multiple scales to address the health burden of shipping emissions. In this study, we conduct an integrated analysis of global ship emissions and their PM2.5-related health impacts, in which we differentiate the contributions from domestic and international shipping. We create bottom-up global ship emission inventories based on ship activity records from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), and then apply the GEOS-Chem model and Global Exposure Mortality Model to quanitfy shipping-related PM<sub>2.5</sub>-concentrations and associated moralities. We also quantify the public health benefits under different control scenarios including the 2020 0.5% Sulphur Cap, a post-2020 0.1% Sulphur Cap, and a post-2020 Tier III NOx Standard. We find that 94,200 (95% confidence interval: 84,800 - 103,000) premature deaths were associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure due to maritime shipping in 2015, of which 83% were associated with international shipping activities and 17% with domestic shipping. Although the global health burdens of ship emissions are dominated by international shipping, the fraction varies by region: 44% of shipping-related deaths in China come from domestic shipping activities. We estimate about 30,200 (27,200 - 33,000) avoided deaths per year under a scenario consistent with a 2020 0.5% Sulphur Cap. We additionally examine two post-2020 control scenarios: we find that a Tier III NOx Standard would have greater benefits than a 0.1% Sulphur Cap, with the two policies reducing annual shipping-attributable PM2.5-related premature deaths by 33,300 (30,100 - 36,400) and 5,070 (4,560 - 5,540), respectively.","Zhang, Y.; Eastham, S.D.; Lau, A.K.H.; Fung, J.; Selin, N.E.",,"Zhang, Yiqi, Y.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac146b,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assessment of Canada's offshore wind resources has a strategic significance for realizing its low-carbon future. This study focused on high-resolution and high-accuracy estimates of offshore wind resources over Canada using satellite-derived wind maps, e.g., CCMP (Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform) images from 1988 to 2017. The CCMP derived wind speed and density were bias-corrected by ocean surface wind measurements collected from 63 stations located along the seas/lakes in Canada from 1987 to 2018. A series of consistent offshore wind resource maps were produced and analyzed. The results generated from CCMP were then compared with previous assessment (i.e., Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)'s Wind Atlas) and proved to perform better in simulating wind speeds. We estimated the technically available offshore wind area, gross power capacity and gross potential over Canada. For example, a gross potential production of 20.348, 20.441, and 20.376 PWh/year were calculated using three commercial offshore wind turbines, i.e. GE 3.6s, REpower 5 M, and V164–8.0 over the calculated total gross offshore area of 1.053 million km<sup>2</sup>. It far exceeds the Canada's electricity consumption (i.e., 0.641 PWh) in 2018. In addition, most of the potential power productions are distributed in the Canadian Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Hudson Bay and St Lawrence, with the mean wind speeds increasing from 1988 to 2017. This study can help to assess offshore wind resources and provide decision-makers with some scientific evidences for developing offshore wind in Canada.","Dong, C.; Huang, G.(G.); Cheng, G.",,"Dong, Cong, C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121422,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Canada,,,,Offshore wind; CCMP; Resource assessment; Wind atlas,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, current negotiations by the United Nations aim for an international legally-binding instrument to improve governance and sustainable use of biodiversity in ABNJ. Penguins are among the most threatened seabird groups today, notably at sea from fisheries and oiling. Here, we examine the available information on penguins’ movements and evaluate their use of ABNJ across species and life-cycle stages. We highlight that in most of the 18 extant penguin species, the birds may undertake spectacular migrations, seasonally or throughout life-cycle stages. Long-range movements were reported in 16 species, with trans-jurisdictional distribution in 14 species, including 13 in ABNJ. Species richness in ABNJ varied extensively according to oceanic region, and also varied according to season. Transboundary movements, notably to ABNJ, are thus remarkably prevalent among penguin species. Consequently, provisions of the treaty under negotiation may crucially benefit penguin conservation, notably by creating a uniform legal framework to designate protected areas in ABNJ, and by promoting the precautionary approach to extraction activities. However, the seasonally-dynamic utilisation of ABNJ by penguins supports the pertinence of adding innovative protection tools, such as mobile Marine Protected Areas, to the negotiations for a more adequate protection of marine biodiversity. Underlining penguins’ remarkable connectivity to the high seas can thus further strengthen this instrument aiming to protect a global ocean commons heritage of mankind.","Thiebot, J.-B.; Dreyfus, M.",,"Dreyfus, Magali, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104640,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,"Endangered species, ""High seas"", ""Marine policy"", ""Tracking""",,Area-based management tools (ABMTs); Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ); Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); Migration Fisheries; At-sea distribution,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulse position modulation (PPM) is an acoustic telemetry method that allows multiple unique identification codes to be transmitted at a single acoustic frequency, typically in the 69 kHz range. However, because the potential number of unique identification codes (i.e. tags) is ultimately limited by the number of pulses in the PPM signal, this poses a practical limitation. In addition, different manufacturers have developed different approaches to encoding the transmitted data, hampering compatibility across brands. A lack of broad compatibility across telemetry systems restricts users to a single manufacturer and operating system, reduces market competition and limits innovation. As the aquatic animal tracking research community organizes towards networks of devices and data, incompatibility becomes more problematic and jeopardizes the unique scientific benefits offered by the networking approach.

Among other groups, pelagic fish are likely to be affected by sound from human activities, but so far have received relatively little attention. Offshore wind farms have become numerous and will become even more abundant in the next decades. Wind farms can be interesting to pelagic fish due to food abundance or fisheries restrictions. At the same time, construction of wind farms involves high levels of anthropogenic noise, likely disturbing and/or deterring pelagic fish. Here, we investigated whether bottom-moored echosounders are a suitable tool for studying the effects of impulsive – intermittent, high-intensity – anthropogenic noise on pelagic fish around wind farms and we explored the possible nature of their responses. Three different wind farms along the Dutch and Belgian coast were examined, one with exposure to the passing by of an experimental seismic survey with a full-scale airgun array, one with pile driving activity in an adjacent wind farm construction site and one control site without exposure. Two bottom-moored echosounders were placed in each wind farm and recorded fish presence and behaviour before, during and after the exposures. The echosounders were successful in detecting variation in the number of fish schools and their behaviour. During the seismic survey exposure there were significantly fewer, but more cohesive, schools than before, whereas during pile driving fish swam shallower with more cohesive schools. However, the types and magnitudes of response patterns were also observed at the control site with no impulsive sound exposure. We therefore stress the need for thorough replication beyond single case studies, before we can conclude that impulsive sounds, from either seismic surveys or pile driving, are a disturbing factor for pelagic fish in otherwise attractive habitat around wind farms.","Kok, A.C.M.; Bruil, L.; Berges, B.; Sakinan, S.; Debusschere, E.; Reubens, J.; de Haan, D.; Norro, A.; Slabbekoorn, H.",,"Sakinan, Serdar, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118063,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,Anthropogenic noise; Fish schools; Good environmental status; Noise impact assessment,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, we developed an Index of Resilience and Vulnerability (IRV) for 133 species of tropical finfishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Using 7 resilience and 6 vulnerability attributes, two-dimensional scatter plots of the resilience and vulnerability scores were generated and the Euclidean distance and angle from the origin to each point were calculated to determine IRV and the effect of fishing on fish species. By ranking the species, the top 10 highly resilient, highly vulnerable, and high-risk species (low IRV) were identified. While small-sized species with fast growth rate and low trophic level were among the highly resilient species, large predatory species such as sharks and barracudas were among the highly vulnerable and high-risk species. More than 100 of the 133 species were resilient-yet-vulnerable, and most crustaceans showed high resilience. Differences in IRV scores among species within the same family were discernible, indicating the differences in the biological characteristics and response to fishing. Sensitivity analysis indicated that an abridged IRV with 6 attributes works similar to 13 attributes and can be used in data-deficient situations. Comparison of R and V of IRV with other assessments showed different results because of divergences in the objectives, number and types of attributes, and thresholds used. These assessments do not convey the same information and therefore great care must be taken for reproducing these frameworks to other fisheries. The results of IRV analysis can be useful for stock assessments and in developing effective management measures in combination with other complementary information.","Mohamed, K.S.; Sathianandan, T.V.; Vivekanandan, E.; Kuriakose, S.; Ganga, U.; Pillai, S.L.; Nair, R.J.",,"Mohamed, Kolliyil, K.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255879,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

University of Rhode Island: Kingston. 140 pp.","The absence of coordinated international management for shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus, hereafter: mako) in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with a lack of knowledge about large-scale mako movements and habitat use, have hampered effective mako shark management in the North Atlantic (Campana, 2016). In addition to fishing pressure, anthropogenic factors like the expansion of oil rigs into deeper pelagic waters and development of offshore wind farms in the Northwest Atlantic are likely to influence mako habitat use (Bailey, Brooks, and Thompson, 2014). Our work used a longitudinal satellite telemetry dataset to investigate the movement patterns of 60 mako sharks in relation to a suite of human interactions, including jurisdictional boundaries, management measures, and energy exploration in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Altogether, mako sharks visited 27 different Exclusive Economic Zones in the North Atlantic Ocean. Sharks tagged off the U.S. showed seasonal and behavioral influences in their transboundary movements, as well as potential demographic deviances. Sharks tagged off of Mexico showed less variability in their transboundary movements as a response to season and movement behavior. Current U.S. management strategies provide insufficient protection for the North Atlantic shortfin mako stock. We found, the degree of overlap between the shark's core area and existing oil rigs to be negligible, and offshore oil rigs and the Block Island Wind Farm did not significantly affect shark movement behavior. However, we show that the proposed locations of offshore wind farms are within a highly utilized area for mako sharks in the western North Atlantic. Our study emphasizes the need to implement cooperative international management and improvement in U.S. management strategies to facilitate the recovery of the North Atlantic shortfin mako stock. In addition, we highlight the need to develop a deeper understanding of offshore wind farms' effect on mako sharks and other highly migratory species.","Manz, M.H.",,"Manz, Maria, M.H.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the beach ecology studies present exposed beaches as physically dominated ecosystems where abiotic factors largely determine the structure and distribution of macrobenthic communities. However, beach species patterns at different scales can be modified by the interaction between different environmental variables, including biotic interactions. In this study, we examined the role of different environmental variables for describing the regional and local scale distributions of common macrobenthic species across 39 beaches along the North coast of Spain. The analyses were carried out using boosted regression trees, a relatively new technique from the field of machine learning. Our study showed that the macroinvertebrate community on exposed beaches is not structured by a single physical factor, but instead by a complex set of drivers including the biotic compound. Thus, at a regional scale the macrobenthic community, in terms of number of species and abundance, was mainly explained by surrogates of food availability, such as chlorophyll a. The results also revealed that the local scale is a feasible way to construct general predictive species-environmental models, since relationships derived from different beaches showed similar responses for most of the species. However, additional information on aspects of beach species distribution can be obtained with large scale models. This study showed that species-environmental models should be validated against changes in spatial extent, and also illustrates the utility of BRTs as a powerful analysis tool for ecology data insight.","Rodil, I.F.; Compton, T.J.; Lastra, M.",WOS:000305781700051,"Lastra, Mariano, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039609,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Climate warming and the poleward widening of the tropical belt have induced range shifts in a variety of marine and terrestrial species. Range expansions may have broad implications on native biota and ecosystem functioning as shifting species may perturb recipient communities. Larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera constitute ubiquitous and prominent components of shallow water ecosystems, and range shifts of these important protists are likely to trigger changes in ecosystem functioning. We have used historical and newly acquired occurrence records to compute current range shifts of <em>Amphistegina</em> spp., a larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera, along the eastern coastline of Africa and compare them to analogous range shifts currently observed in the Mediterranean Sea. The study provides new evidence that amphisteginid foraminifera are rapidly progressing southwestward, closely approaching Port Edward (South Africa) at 31°S. To project future species distributions, we applied a species distribution model (SDM) based on ecological niche constraints of current distribution ranges. Our model indicates that further warming is likely to cause a continued range extension, and predicts dispersal along nearly the entire southeastern coast of Africa. The average rates of amphisteginid range shift were computed between 8 and 2.7 km year<sup>−1</sup>, and are projected to lead to a total southward range expansion of 267 km, or 2.4° latitude, in the year 2100.

Most of today's taxa are restricted to tropical and subtropical regions (between 30°N and 30°S) and their minimum temperature limits are governed by the 14 to 20°C isotherms. However, during times of extensive global warming (e.g., the Eocene and Miocene), larger foraminifera have been found as far north as 50°N (North America and Central Europe) as well as towards 47°S in New Zealand. During the last century, sea surface temperatures have been rising significantly. This trend is expected to continue and climate change scenarios for 2050 suggest a further increase by 1 to 3°C. We applied Species Distribution Models to assess potential distribution range changes of three taxa of larger foraminifera under current and future climate. The studied foraminifera include <em>Archaias angulatus</em>, <em>Calcarina</em> spp., and <em>Amphistegina</em> spp., and represent taxa with regional, superregional and global distribution patterns. Under present environmental conditions, <em>Amphistegina</em> spp. shows the largest potential distribution, apparently due to its temperature tolerance. Both <em>Archaias angulatus</em> and <em>Calcarina</em> spp. display potential distributions that cover currently uninhabited regions. Under climate conditions expected for the year 2050, all taxa should display latitudinal range expansions between 1 to 2.5 degrees both north- and southward. The modeled range projections suggest that some larger foraminifera may colonize biogeographic regions that so far seemed unsuitable. <em>Archaias angulatus</em> and <em>Calcarina</em> spp. also show an increase in habitat suitability within their native occurrence ranges, suggesting that their tolerance for maximum temperatures has yet not been fully exploited and that they benefit from ocean warming.

We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects — generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the <em>in situ</em> temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.","Smit, A.J.; Roberts, M.; Anderson, R.J.; Dufois, F.; Dudley, S.F.J.; Bornman, T.G.; Olbers, J.; Bolton, J.J.",WOS:000327947800072,"Bornman, Thomas, T.G.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081944,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because remoteness, depth and ice cover restrict sampling in the South Ocean, species distribution modelling is a useful tool for evaluating distributions. We used physical specimen and towed camera data to describe the diversity and distribution of shrimps in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. Eight shrimp species were recorded: <em>Chorismus antarcticus; Notocrangon antarcticus; Nematocarcinus lanceopes; Dendrobranchiata</em>; <em>Pasiphaea scotiae</em>; <em>Pasiphaea</em> cf. <em>ledoyeri</em>; <em>Petalidium</em> sp., and a new species of <em>Lebbeus</em>.

Two independent sets of environmental data layers at 0.05° and 0.5° resolution respectively, showed how spatial resolution affected the model. <em>Chorismus antarcticus</em> and <em>N. antarcticus</em> were found only on the continental shelf and upper slopes, while <em>N. lanceopes, Lebbeus</em> n. sp., <em>Dendrobranchiata, Petalidium</em> sp., <em>Pasiphaea</em> cf. <em>ledoyeri,</em> and <em>Pasiphaea scotiae</em> were found on the slopes, seamounts and abyssal plain. The environmental variables that contributed most to models for <em>N. antarcticus</em> were depth, chlorophyll-<em>a</em> concentration, temperature, and salinity, and for <em>N. lanceopes</em> were depth, ice concentration, seabed slope/rugosity, and temperature. The relative ranking, but not the composition of these variables changed in models using different spatial resolutions, and the predicted extent of suitable habitat was smaller in models using the finer-scale environmental layers.

However, direct observational evidence to address the geographic scale and delineation of ephemeral or persistent populations for many marine fishes is limited. The Lined seahorse (<em>Hippocampus erectus</em>) can be commonly found in three western Atlantic zoogeographic provinces, though inhabitants of the temperate northern Virginia Province are often considered tropical vagrants that only arrive during warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as temperatures decline. Although genetics can locate regions of historical population persistence and isolation, previous evidence of Virginia Province persistence is only provisional due to limited genetic sampling (i.e., mitochondrial DNA and five nuclear loci). To test alternative hypotheses of historical persistence versus the ephemerality of a northern Virginia Province population we used a RADseq generated dataset consisting of 11,708 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) sampled from individuals collected from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to Long Island, NY. Concordant results from genomic analyses all infer three genetically divergent subpopulations, and strongly support Virginia Province inhabitants as a genetically diverged and a historically persistent ancestral gene pool. These results suggest that individuals that emerge in coastal areas during the warm season can be considered “local” and supports offshore migration during the colder months. This research demonstrates how a large number of genes sampled across a geographical range can capture the diversity of coalescent histories (across loci) while inferring population history. Moreover, these results clearly demonstrate the utility of population genomic data to infer peripheral subpopulation persistence in difficult-to-observe species.","Boehm, J.T.; Waldman, J.; Robinson, J.D.; Hickerson, M.J.",WOS:000348732100033,"Waldman, John, J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116219,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Hippocampus erectus,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small burrow-nesting seabirds provide a suitable case study, as they are often restricted to safe breeding sites on islands, resulting in a patchy breeding distribution. For example, Thin-billed prions <em>Pachyptila belcheri</em> have two major breeding colonies more than 8,000 km apart, on the Falkland Islands in the south-western Atlantic and in the Kerguelen Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. We used geolocators and stable isotopes to compare at-sea movements and trophic levels of these two populations during their non-breeding season, and applied ecological niche models to compare environmental conditions in the habitat. Over three winters, birds breeding in the Atlantic showed a high consistency in their migration routes. Most individuals migrated more than 3000 km eastwards, while very few remained over the Patagonian Shelf. In contrast, all Indian Ocean birds migrated westwards, resulting in an overlapping nonbreeding area in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Geolocators and isotopic signature of feathers indicated that prions from the Falklands moulted at slightly higher latitudes than those from Kerguelen Islands. All birds fed on low trophic level prey, most probably crustaceans. The phenology differed notably between the two populations. Falkland birds returned to the Patagonian Shelf after 2-3 months, while Kerguelen birds remained in the nonbreeding area for seven months, before returning to nesting grounds highly synchronously and at high speed. Habitat models identified sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration as important environmental parameters. In summary, we show that even though the two very distant populations migrate to roughly the same area to moult, they have distinct wintering strategies: They had significantly different realized niches and timing which may contribute to spatial niche partitioning.","Quillfeldt, P.; Cherel, Y.; Masello, J.F.; Delord, K.; McGill, R.A.R.; Furness, R.W.; Moodley, Y.; Weimerskirch, H.",WOS:000355185600009,"Moodley, Yoshan, Y.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125007,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Pachyptila belcheri,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates if and to what extent do human activities that directly or indirectly influence nature (hereafter the human footprint) affect the global distribution of invasive species in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. We selected 72 species including terrestrial plants, terrestrial animals, freshwater and marine invasive species of concern in a focus area located in NW Europe (encompassing Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Belgium). Species Distribution Models were calibrated with the global occurrence of species and a set of high-resolution (9×9 km) environmental (e.g. topography, climate, geology) layers and human footprint proxies (e.g. the human influence index, population density, road proximity). Our analyses suggest that the global occurrence of a wide range of invaders is primarily limited by climate. Temperature tolerance was the most important factor and explained on average 42% of species distribution. Nevertheless, factors related to the human footprint explained a substantial amount (23% on average) of species distributions. When global models were projected into the focus area, spatial predictions integrating the human footprint featured the highest cumulative risk scores close to transport networks (proxy for invasion pathways) and in habitats with a high human influence index (proxy for propagule pressure). We conclude that human related information–currently available in the form of easily accessible maps and databases—should be routinely implemented into predictive frameworks to inform upon policies to prevent and manage invasions. Otherwise we might be seriously underestimating the species and areas under highest risk of future invasions.","Gallardo, B.; Zieritz, A.; Aldridge, D.C.",WOS:000355185600033,"Aldridge, David, D.C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125801,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous species of Indo-pacific origin have colonized the Mediterranean in recent times, including tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Among these is the species <em>Pararotalia calcariformata</em>. Unlike other invasive foraminifera, this species was discovered only two decades ago and is restricted to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Combining ecological, genetic and physiological observations, we attempt to explain the recent invasion of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Using morphological and genetic data, we confirm the species attribution to <em>P</em>. <em>calcariformata</em> McCulloch 1977 and identify its symbionts as a consortium of diatom species dominated by <em>Minutocellus polymorphus</em>. We document photosynthetic activity of its endosymbionts using Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry and test the effects of elevated temperatures on growth rates of asexual offspring. The culturing of asexual offspring for 120 days shows a 30-day period of rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth. A subsequent 48-day temperature sensitivity experiment indicates a similar developmental pathway and high growth rate at 28°C, whereas an almost complete inhibition of growth was observed at 20°C and 35°C. This indicates that the offspring of this species may have lower tolerance to cold temperatures than what would be expected for species native to the Mediterranean. We expand this hypothesis by applying a Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on modern occurrences in the Mediterranean using three environmental variables: irradiance, turbidity and yearly minimum temperature. The model reproduces the observed restricted distribution and indicates that the range of the species will drastically expand westwards under future global change scenarios. We conclude that <em>P</em>. <em>calcariformata</em> established a population in the Levant because of the recent warming in the region. In line with observations from other groups of organisms, our results indicate that continued warming of the eastern Mediterranean will facilitate the invasion of more tropical marine taxa into the Mediterranean, disturbing local biodiversity and ecosystem structure.","Schmidt, C.; Morard, R.; Almogi-Labin, A.; Weinmann, A.E.; Titelboim, D.; Abramovich, S.; Kucera, M.",WOS:000359492800004,"Titelboim, Danna, D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132917,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,"Foraminifera, ""Pararotalia""",,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide hypotheses for discrete ecological niche separation between genetic placozoan lineages, which may also help to understand biogeography patterns in other small marine invertebrates. We, here, used maximum entropy modelling to predict placozoan distribution using 20 environmental grids of 9.2 km<sup>2</sup> resolution. In addition, we used recently developed metrics of niche overlap to compare habitat suitability models of three genetic clades. The predicted distributions range from 55°N to 44°S and are restricted to regions of intermediate to warm sea surface temperatures. High concentrations of salinity and low nutrient concentrations appear as secondary factors. Tests of niche equivalency reveal the largest differences between placozoan clades I and III. Interestingly, the genetically well-separated clades I and V appear to be ecologically very similar. Our habitat suitability models predict a wider latitudinal distribution for placozoans, than currently described, especially in the northern hemisphere.

Ecological responses of reef assemblages to protection from fishing, including potential trophic cascades, were assessed using a control-impact design for the six marine reserves studied with associated reference sites, and also by comparing observations at reserve sites with predictions from random forest models that assume reserve locations are fished. Reserve sites were characterised by higher abundance and biomass of large fishes than fished sites, most notably for snapper <em>Chrysophrys auratus</em>, with forty-fold higher observed biomass inside relative to out. In agreement with conceptual models, significant reserve effects not only reflected direct interactions between fishing and targeted species (higher large fish biomass; higher snapper and lobster abundance), but also second order interactions (lower urchin abundance), third order interactions (higher kelp cover), and fourth order interactions (lower understory algal cover). Unexpectedly, we also found: (i) a consistent trend for higher (~20%) <em>Ecklonia</em> cover across reserves relative to nearby fished sites regardless of lobster and urchin density, (ii) an inconsistent response of crustose coralline algae to urchin density, (iii) low cover of other understory algae in marine reserves with few urchins, and (iv) more variable fish and benthic invertebrate communities at reserve relative to fished locations. Overall, reef food webs showed complex but consistent responses to protection from fishing in well-enforced temperate New Zealand marine reserves.

When changes in such conditions occur, their effects on distribution can be predicted through species distribution models, anticipating suitable habitats for the subsistence of species. <em>Mussismilia harttii</em> is one of the most endangered Brazilian endemic reef-building corals, and in increasing risk of extinction. Herein, species distribution models were used to determine the present and future potential habitats for <em>M</em>. <em>harttii</em>. Estimations were made through the maximum entropy approach, predicting suitable habitat losses and gains by the end of the 21st century. For this purpose, species records published in the last 20 years and current and future environmental variables were correlated. The best models were chosen according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and evaluated through the partial ROC (AUCratio), a new approach which uses independent occurrence data. Both approaches showed that the models performed satisfactorily in predicting potential habitat areas for the species. Future projections were made using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2100, with different levels of greenhouse gas emission. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to model the Future Potential Habitat (FPH) of <em>M</em>. <em>harttii</em> in two different scenarios: stabilization of emissions (RCP 4.5) and increase of emissions (RCP 8.5). According to the results, shallow waters to the south of the study area concentrate most of the current potential habitats for the species. However, in future scenarios, there was a loss of suitable areas in relation to the Current Potential Habitat (RCP 4.5 46% and RCP 8.5 59%), whereas there is a southward shift of the suitable areas. In all scenarios of FPH, the temperature was the variable with the greatest contribution to the models (&gt; 35%), followed by the current velocity (&gt; 33%) and bathymetry (&gt;29%). In contrast, there is an increase of deep (50–75 m) suitable areas FPH scenarios, mainly in the southern portion of its distribution, at Abrolhos Bank (off Espirito Santo State). These deeper sites might serve as refugia for the species in global warming scenarios. Coral communities at such depths would be less susceptible to impacts of climate change on temperature and salinity. However, the deep sea is not free from human impacts and measures to protect deeper ecosystems should be prioritized in environmental policies for Brazilian marine conservation, especially the Abrolhos Bank, due to its importance for <em>M</em>. <em>harttii</em>.","de Oliveira, U.D.R.; Gomes, P.B.; Silva Cordeiro, R.T.; de Lima, G.V.; Pérez, C.D.",WOS:000468451000002,"de Oliveira, Umberto, U.D.R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211171,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowing the invasive dynamic of non-native species, as well as its behavior at different natural or anthropogenic scenarios, is fundamental for planning conservation management policies and control plans. The invasive sea anemone <i>Anemonia alicemartinae</i> in habits from the north (18°S) to the south-central (36°S) coast of Chile and its distribution range has expanded by approximately 1,928 km in the last 50 years. Previous works have proposed that human-mediated southward transport associated with regional-scale maritime activities could explain its rapid spread. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used ecological niche models (ENM) to evaluate the potential colonization of the southernmost area of South America. Additionally, we conducted a post hoc analysis to evaluate the relationship between the prediction of the ENM and human activity measured as the number of landings of ships in ports. The models were built based on presence records of <i>A. alicemartinae</i>, and oceanographic variables. Results showed that sea surface salinity and annual sea surface temperature (variance) are the best predictor variables to explain the distribution of <i>A. alicemartinae</i>. There was a positive and significant relationship between the geographical distribution of the sea anemone predicted by the ENM and the number of landings, as a proxy of anthropogenic activity. The most susceptible areas to invasion were those that showed the highest variability in both oceanographic predictors. These areas included the Biobío region, Chiloé´s inland sea, Aysén, and Chacabuco regions, which together comprise two biogeographical provinces.

This study describes the degree of specificity of a bioluminescent symbiosis between cardinalfishes in the genus <i>Siphamia</i> and luminous bacteria in the Vibrio family. Primarily using museum specimens, we investigated the codivergence of host and symbiont and test for patterns of divergence that correlate with both biogeography and time. Contrary to expectations, we determined that the light organ symbionts of all 14 <i>Siphamia</i> species examined belong to one genetic clade of <i>Photobacterium mandapamensis</i> (Clade II), indicating that the association is highly specific and conserved throughout the host genus. Thus, we did not find evidence of codivergence among hosts and symbionts. We did observe that symbionts hosted by individuals sampled from colder water regions were more divergent, containing more than three times as many single nucleotide polymorphisms than the rest of the symbionts examined. Overall, our findings indicate that the symbiosis between <i>Siphamia</i> fishes and <i>P. mandapamensis</i> Clade II has been highly conserved across host taxa and over a broad geographic range despite the facultative nature of the bacterial symbiont.

In marine conservation, these data are often combined with spatial analytical techniques to produce marine habitat maps. While marine habitat mapping is increasingly used to inform conservation efforts, this field is still relatively young and its methods are rapidly evolving. Because conservation efforts do not always specify standards or guidelines for the production of habitat maps, results can vary dramatically. As representations of real environmental characteristics, habitat maps are highly sensitive to how they are produced. In this review paper, I present four concepts that are known to cause variation in spatial representation and prediction of habitats: the methodology used, the quality and scale of the data, and the choice of variables in regards to fitness for use. I then discuss the potential antinomy associated with the use of habitat maps in conservation: while habitat maps have become an invaluable tool to inform and assist decision-making, maps of the same area built using different methods and data may provide dissimilar representations, thus providing different information and possibly leading to different decisions. Exploring the theories and methods that have proved effective in terrestrial conservation and the spatial sciences, and how they can be integrated in marine habitat mapping practices, could help improve maps used to support marine conservation efforts and result in more reliable products to inform conservation decisions. Having a strong, consistent, transparent, repeatable, and science-based protocol for data collection and mapping is essential for effectively supporting decision-makers in developing conservation and management plans. The development of user-friendly tools to assist in the application of such protocol is crucial to a widespread improvement in practices. I discuss the potential to use interactive and collaborative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to encourage the conservation and management community, from data collectors and mapmakers to decision-makers, to move toward a digital resilience and to develop such science-based protocol. Until standards and protocols are developed, habitat maps should always be interpreted with care, and the methods and metadata associated with their production should always be explicitly stated.","Lecours, V.",WOS:000457690600286,"Lecours, Vincent, V.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00288,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assess the biogeography of seaweeds along 2,900 km of South Africa's coastline in relation to a thermal gradient produced by the Agulhas Current, and contrast this with the environmental structure created by the Benguela Current. We subdivided the coastline into “bioregions” to examine the regional patterning. To investigate the assembly mechanisms, we decomposed Sørensen's β-diversity into “turnover” (β<sub>sim</sub>) and “nestedness-resultant” (β<sub>sne</sub>) dissimilarities, and used distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) to relate them to the Euclidean thermal difference, d<sub>E</sub>, and geographical distance. Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) were used as an additional set of spatial constraints. Variation partitioning was then used to find the relative strengths of thermal and spatially-structured thermal drivers. Spatial and environmental predictors explained 97.9% of the total variation in β<sub>sim</sub> and the thermal gradient accounted for 84.2% of this combined pool. β<sub>sim</sub> was the major component of overall β-diversity in the Agulhas Current region, suggesting niche influences (environmental sorting) as dominant assembly process there. The much weaker thermal gradient in the Benguela Current-influenced region resulted in a high amount of β<sub>sne</sub> that could indicate neutral assembly processes. The intensification of upwelling during the mid-Pliocene 4.6–3.2 Ma (i.e., historical factors) were likely responsible for setting up the strong disjunction between the species-poor west coast and species-rich south and east coast floras, and this separation continues to maintain two systems of community structuring mechanisms in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean influenced sides of South Africa.","Smit, A.J.; Bolton, J.J.; Anderson, R.J.",WOS:000457690600401,"Anderson, Robert, R.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00404,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ecosystems provide nursery grounds and food for fish and invertebrates, coastline protection from erosion, carbon sequestration, and nutrient fixation. For marine macrophytes, temperature is generally the most important range limiting factor, and ocean warming is considered the most severe threat among global climate change factors. Ocean warming induced losses of dominant macrophytes along their equatorial range edges, as well as range extensions into polar regions, are predicted and already documented. While adaptive evolution based on genetic change is considered too slow to keep pace with the increasing rate of anthropogenic environmental changes, rapid adaptation may come about through a set of non-genetic mechanisms involving the functional composition of the associated microbiome, as well as epigenetic modification of the genome and its regulatory effect on gene expression and the activity of transposable elements. While research in terrestrial plants demonstrates that the integration of non-genetic mechanisms provide a more holistic picture of a species' evolutionary potential, research in marine systems is lagging behind. Here, we aim to review the potential of marine macrophytes to acclimatize and adapt to major climate change effects via intraspecific variation at the genetic, epigenetic, and microbiome levels. All three levels create phenotypic variation that may either enhance fitness within individuals (plasticity) or be subject to selection and ultimately, adaptation. We review three of the most important phenotypic variations in a climate change context, including physiological variation, variation in propagation success, and in herbivore resistance. Integrating different levels of plasticity, and adaptability into ecological models will allow to obtain a more holistic understanding of trait variation and a realistic assessment of the future performance and distribution of marine macrophytes.

Three species, the Atlantic spotted dolphin (<i>Stenella frontalis</i>), the pantropical spotted dolphin (<i>S. attenuata</i>), and the spinner dolphin (<i>S. longirostris</i>) are abundant worldwide, but in the Caribbean Basin they have been poorly studied and information on their distribution patterns is scarce. Specifically, in Colombia’s remote Seaflower Biosphere Reserve (SFBR) <i>S. attenuata</i> has been reported occasionally, but <i>S. frontalis</i> and <i>S. longirostris</i> have never been recorded before. To address this information gap, an ecological niche modeling approach was used to determine the potential distribution patterns of these three dolphin species in the region. Records of these species for the Caribbean Basin were compiled, including both published and unpublished data. Environmental information, including bathymetry, bathymetric slope, distance to shore, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration was gathered from public databases (MARSPEC and Bio-ORACLE) in raster format. The maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) for modeling species’ geographic distributions with presence-only data was used. After filtering the data, 210 records of <i>S. attenuata</i>, 204 of <i>S. frontalis</i>, and 80 of <i>S. longirostris</i> were used to run models. The best configuration for each model was chosen based on the Δ<i>AICc</i> criterion. For all three species, the final ecological niche models returned <i>AUC</i> test values higher than 0.8, indicating satisfactory model performance. The resulting potential distribution maps suggested that areas closest to continental shorelines of the Caribbean Basin and surrounding islands had the highest environmental suitability for all species (&gt;70%). All models reported high environmental suitability for <i>S. attenuata</i> and <i>S. longirostris</i> in the SFBR, mainly in the southernmost part surrounding San Andrés and Providence Archipelago. Assessment of niche overlap from the predictions of species distributions using the similarity statistic and pairwise map overlap indicated that <i>S. frontalis</i> and <i>S. longirostris</i> had niches slightly more similar in comparison to <i>S. attenuata</i>.

How environmental factors influence elasmobranch behavior, habitat use, and movement patterns is still relatively poorly understood, in part because of the scale over which many of these animals roam and the remote nature of the marine ecosystems they inhabit. In the last decade there has been an explosion of satellite remote sensing (SRS) technologies that can cover these vast spatial scales for the marine environment. Consequentially, SRS presents an opportunity to analyze important environmental drivers in elasmobranch ecology and to aid management decisions for the conservation of declining populations. A systematic literature review was undertaken to synthesize the current use of SRS environmental data in elasmobranch research. In addition, to facilitate the use of SRS in this field moving forward, we have compiled a list of popular SRS data sources and sensors for common environmental variables in marine science. Our review of 71 papers (55 published in the last 10 years) identified ten SRS-derived environmental variables that have been used in elasmobranch studies, from a range of satellite sensors and data sources. Sea surface temperature and ocean productivity were the most frequently used variables. Articles primarily analyzed variables individually or in pairs, with few studies looking at a suite of interacting variables. Here, we present a summary of the current state of knowledge on the application of SRS, current gaps and limitations, and discuss some of the potential future directions in which we envisage this field developing. Threatened elasmobranch populations inhabit some of the world’s most remote marine ecosystems. With often global coverage, SRS presents an opportunity to analyze the important environmental drivers of elasmobranch ecology to aid management decisions for the conservation of declining and threatened populations.","Williamson, M.J.; Tebbs, E.J.; Dawson, T.P.; Jacoby, D.M.P.",WOS:000462734000001,"Dawson, Terence, T.P.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00135,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge about the distribution of <i>Cystoseira</i> canopies was available for about the 14% of the Mediterranean coastline. Absence data were available only for the 2% of the basin. Despite these gaps, our HSM showed high accuracy levels in reproducing <i>Cystoseira</i> distribution so that the first continuous maps of the habitat across the entire basin was produced. Misclassification errors mainly occurred in the eastern and southern part of the basin, where large gaps of knowledge emerged. The most relevant drivers were the geomorphological ones, followed by anthropogenic variables proxies of pollution and urbanization. Our model shows the importance of data sharing to combine a large number of spatial and environmental data, allowing to individuate areas with high probability of <i>Cystoseira</i> occurrence as suitable for its presence. This approach encourages the use of this modeling tool for the prediction of <i>Cystoseira</i> distribution and for supporting and planning conservation and management initiatives.

Telemetry data suggest the likely origins of five individuals, which traveled one-way distances of up to 176 km from the FSA in the central Bahamas to two sites within a no-take marine protected area (MPA). Analyses of high-resolution SNP markers (including candidate loci under selection) illustrated patterns of spatial structure and genetic connectivity not reflected by telemetry data alone. Nassau grouper from Exuma and Long Island appear to have genetic signatures that differ from other islands and from the Hail Mary FSA.

Mass population declines or geographic shifts in species ranges are expected to occur, potentially leading to wide-scale ecosystem disruption or collapse. This is particularly important for habitat-forming species such as free-living non-geniculate coralline algae that aggregate to form large, structurally complex reef-life ecosystems with high associated biodiversity and carbon sequestration capability. Coralline algal beds have a worldwide distribution, but have recently experienced global declines due to anthropogenic pressures and changing environmental conditions. However, the environmental factors controlling coralline algal bed distribution remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to make adequate assessments of how populations may change in the future. We constructed the first species distribution model for non-geniculate coralline algae (focusing on maerl-forming species but including crustose coralline algae associated with coralline algal beds) and showed that bathymetry, temperature at the seabed and light availability are the primary environmental drivers of present-day non-geniculate coralline algae distribution. Our model also identifies suitable areas for species presence that currently lack records of occurrence. Large-scale spatial declines in coralline algal distribution were observed under all IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (ranging from 38% decline under RCP 2.6 up to 84% decline under RCP 8.5), with the most rapid rate of decline up to 2050.

For species that are the structural basis of marine ecosystems, such effects can be magnified into drastic loss of ecosystem functioning and resilience. Rhodoliths are unattached calcareous red algae that provide key complex three-dimensional habitats for highly diverse biological communities. These globally distributed biodiversity hotspots are increasingly threatened by ongoing environmental changes, mainly ocean acidification and warming, with wide negative impacts anticipated in the years to come. These are superimposed upon major local stressors caused by direct destructive impacts, such as bottom trawling, which act synergistically in the deterioration of the rhodolith ecosystem health and function. Anticipating the potential impacts of future environmental changes on the rhodolith biome may inform timely mitigation strategies integrating local effects of bottom trawling over vulnerable areas at global scales. This study aimed to identify future climate refugia, as regions where persistence is predicted under contrasting climate scenarios, and to analyze their trawling threat levels. This was approached by developing species distribution models with ecologically relevant environmental predictors, combined with the development of a global bottom trawling intensity index to identify heavily fished regions overlaying rhodoliths. Our results revealed the importance of light, thermal stress and pH driving the global distribution of rhodoliths. Future projections showed poleward expansions and contractions of suitable habitats at lower latitudes, structuring cryptic depth refugia, particularly evident under the more severe warming scenario RCP 8.5. Our results suggest that if management and conservation measures are not taken, bottom trawling may directly threaten the persistence of key rhodolith refugia. Since rhodoliths have slow growth rates, high sensitivity and ecological importance, understanding how their current and future distribution might be susceptible to bottom trawling pressure, may contribute to determine the fate of both the species and their associated communities.","Fragkopoulou, E.; Serrão, E.A.; Horta, P.A.; Koerich, G.; Assis, J.",WOS:000612347200001,"Fragkopoulou, Eliza, E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.594537,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We implemented a species distribution model (SDM) approach to (1) hindcast the habitat suitability of <i>H. stipulacea</i> over the last 100 years in the Mediterranean basin, and (2) to model the increase in the potential habitat suitability of <i>H. stipulacea</i> and <i>H. decipiens</i> during the current century under two very different climate scenarios, RCP 2.6 (lowest carbon emission scenario) and RCP 8.5 (highest carbon emission scenario).

Results from this PCA suggest that the <i>H. stipulacea</i> populations of the Mediterranean and Red Sea are likely to be similar. In contrast, <i>H. decipiens</i> from the Mediterranean is more related to the Atlantic populations rather than to the Red Sea populations. The hindcast model suggests that the expansion of <i>H. stipulacea</i> was related to the increases in seawater temperatures in the Mediterranean over the last 100 years.

The habitat suitability for <i>H. stipulacea</i> will keep expanding westward and northward as the Mediterranean continues to become saltier and warmer. In comparison, the SDMs built for <i>H. decipiens</i> forecast a restricted habitat suitability in the south-eastern Mediterranean Sea at the present environmental conditions and predicts a progressive expansion with a potential increase in habitat suitability along 85% of the Mediterranean coastline.

The relatively small intersection of model-predicted foraging areas for these 2 species within the study area may indicate possible niche differentiations.

This helps to explain why, compared with recently detected NIS, established NIS are predicted to be more prevalent in Atlantic Canada currently and exhibit the greatest potential to expand their range under future climate scenarios. For example, the distribution of established NIS is predicted to shift northwards, while the area of suitable habitat is projected to more than double by 2075. The potential distribution of recently detected NIS is also predicted to shift northwards, with only a negligible increase in the area of potentially suitable habitat by 2075. These projected distributional changes may result in an expansion of areas where the distributions of recently detected and established NIS overlap to form NIS biodiversity hotspots. Our findings guide the development of pre-emptive and targeted NIS monitoring and mitigation strategies to guard against potentially negative impacts to bivalve aquaculture and sensitive ecological communities.","Lowen, J.B.; DiBacco, C.",WOS:000400345700013,"DiBacco, Claudio, C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps12077,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Tunicata,,,Species distribution · Tunicates · Nearshore · Risk assessment · Invasive species · Climate change · Ecological niche models,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of physical features or coarse habitat types as surrogates of species distribution often does not provide an accurate enough (and hence useful) mapping of where species occur. This is further exacerbated in data-poor regions, where habitat maps in the marine environment are often patchy. A combination of satellite imaging analysis (for a rough classification of the main habitat types in shallow waters) and occupancy modelling based on data collected through dedicated underwater surveys is proposed as a relatively inexpensive and timely way to identify priority areas for the conservation of selected benthic species. The occupancy surveys provide estimates of the probability of presence, which can be used as weights of the importance of the available suitable habitat types in a potential habitat index (PHI). This approach was applied in the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) for 6 benthic hard-bottom species of conservation importance. Repetitive SCUBA diving surveys were conducted at six 5 m depth zones between 0 and 30 m at 47 locations in the Aegean Sea to detect the presence of the target species. Occupancy was modelled using several environmental spatial covariates. The applied method explicitly incorporated imperfect detectability in the modelling process. Predictive distributional maps of PHI were produced for each species, identifying areas that could be prioritized for conservation measures. Despite some limitations, this approach can provide a baseline for the protection of vulnerable species, in the framework of adaptive management for marine conservation planning.","Katsanevakis, S.; Sini, M.; Dailianis, T.; Gerovasileiou, V.; Koukourouvli, N.; Topouzelis, K.; Ragkousis, M.",WOS:000411307400002,"Koukourouvli, Nikoletta, N.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps12232,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Occupancy · Species distribution · Biodiversity mapping · Underwater visual survey · Detectability · Marine conservation,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The northern edge shift was less certain, yet resulted in an expansion of total eelgrass habitat. To minimize the extent of eelgrass bed extinction and areas of reduced growth along the southern range, strong climate mitigation is critical. Moreover, warm-temperature stress in reduced-growth areas will greatly increase the susceptibility of eelgrass to other natural or anthropogenic stressors.

We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation, and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundance patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution.

Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.","Nolan, M.K.B.; Kim, C.J.S.; Hoegh-Guldberg, O.; Beger, M.",WOS:000654277500004,"Nolan, Megan, M.K.B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109155,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Spatial prioritization; Coral cover; Species distribution models; Coral reef restoration; Marine conservation; Marxan,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biogeography of marine parasites is poorly known, especially because it requires an understanding of host-parasite interactions, information that is rare, especially over large spatial scales. Here, we have studied the biogeographical patterns of dactylogyrid parasites of chaetodontids, one of the most well-studied fish families, in the tropical Indo-west Pacific region. Dactylogyrid parasites were collected from gills of 34 butterflyfish species (<em>n</em> = 560) at nine localities within an approximate area of 62 million km<sup>2</sup>. Thirteen dactylogyrid species were identified, with richness ranging from 6 to 12 species at individual localities. Most dactylogyrid communities were dominated by <em>Haliotrema angelopterum</em> or <em>Haliotrema aurigae</em>, for which relative abundance was negatively correlated (<em>ρ</em> = −0.59). Parasite richness and diversity were highest in French Polynesia and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and lowest in Palau. Three biogeographic regions were identified based on dactylogyrid dissimilarities: French Polynesia, characterised by the dominance of <em>H. angelopterum</em>, the western Pacific region dominated by <em>H. aurigae</em>, and Ningaloo Reef (Australia), dominated by <em>Euryhaliotrema berenguelae</em>. Structure of host assemblages was the main factor explaining the dissimilarity (turnover and nestedness components of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) of parasite communities between localities, while environment was only significant in the turnover of parasite communities and overall adissimilarity.

In aquatic environments, high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems make it technically possible to simultaneously monitor large amounts of individuals at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions, providing a unique opportunity to study the behaviour and social interactions using a reality mining approach. Despite the potential, high-resolution telemetry systems have had very limited use in coastal marine areas due to the limitations that these environments pose to the transmission of acoustic signals. This study aims at designing and testing a high-resolution acoustic telemetry system to monitor, for the first time, a natural fish population in an open marine area. First, we conducted preliminary range tests and a computer simulation study to identify the optimal design of the telemetry system. Then, we performed a series of stationary and moving tests to characterize the performance of the system in terms of positioning efficiency and precision. Finally, we obtained a dataset corresponding to the movements of 170 concurrently tagged individuals to demonstrate the overall functioning of the system with a real study case of the behaviour of a small-bodied coastal species. Our results show that high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems efficiently generate positional data in marine systems, providing a precision of few meters, a temporal resolution of few seconds, and the possibility of tracking hundreds of individuals simultaneously. Data post-processing using a trajectory filter and movement models proved to be key to achieve a sub-meter positioning precision. The main limitation detected for our system was the restricted detection range, which was negatively affected by the stratification of the water column. Our work demonstrates that high-resolution acoustic telemetry systems are an effective method to monitor the movements of free-ranging individuals at the population level in coastal sites. By providing highly precise positioning estimates of large amounts of individuals, these systems represent a powerful tool to study key ecological processes regarding the social interactions of individuals, including social dynamics, collective movements, or responses to environmental perturbations, and to extend the studies to poorly studied small-sized species or life-stages.","Aspillaga, E.; Arlinghaus, R.; Martorell-Barceló, M.; Follana-Berná, G.; Lana, A.; Campos-Candela, A.; Alós, J.",,"Martorell-Barceló, Martina, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-020-00224-w,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,Acoustic telemetry,,"High-resolution tracking, Movement ecology, Reality mining",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using <em>in situ</em> sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining <em>in situ</em> samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em> predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to <em>in situ V. parahaemolyticus</em> measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed. However, the complexities of using remotely sensed data for ecological modeling applications and evaluating model performance also highlight the need for more research in this area.","DeLuca, N.M.; Zaitchik, B.F.; Guikema, S.D.; Jacobs, J.M.; Davis, B.J.K.; Curriero, F.C.",WOS:000585306100004,"DeLuca, Nicole, N.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112016,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Vibrio parahaemolyticus,,,"MODIS; Chesapeake Bay; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Ocean color,public health; Statistical analysis; Machine learning",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coral demographics (i.e., density, cover, and skewness and kurtosis coefficients of colony size distributions) were positively correlated with each other and the annual mean seawater temperature (ST), 10<sup>th</sup>-ST percentile (P10<sup>th</sup>-ST), 90<sup>th</sup>-ST percentile (P90<sup>th</sup>-ST) and photosynthetically active radiation at 3-m depth (PAR-3m), but they were negatively correlated with chlorophyll-a. Based on these results, we identified the following thresholds that may constrain the growth of O. patagonica colonies and populations: annual mean ST <19–20 °C, P10<sup>th</sup>-ST <14 °C, P90<sup>th</sup>-ST <25 °C and >27 °C, and PAR-3m <30 mol photons m−2 day−1. The species abundance along the Iberian coast conforms to the abundant-center pattern of distribution. However, the coral demographics indicated that this pattern was not only related to the time of establishment but also to differences in coral population growth, which were correlated with key environmental parameters. Our results contribute understanding of the forces driving population growth of <i>O. patagonica</i> and support the hypothesis of an ongoing coral-mediated tropicalization of macroalgae-dominated temperate ecosystems.","Serrano, E.; Ribes, M.; Coma, R.",WOS:000433153600159,"Serrano, Eduard, E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.032,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Oculina patagonica,,,Scleractinian coral; Sea warming; Artificial reef; Temperate ecosystem; Tropicalization; Global change,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our model results show high suitability in temperate and warm temperate regions around the world, with special highlight to some areas where this species still doesn’t occur. Thalli representing a potential temperate region origin, were held at 10, 13, 16, 20 and 24 °C, and measurements of optimal quantum field (Fv/Fm) demonstrated a decrease of photosynthetic yield in the higher temperature. Thalli from the population already established in warm temperate South Atlantic were held at 18, 24 and 30 °C with high and low nutrient conditions. This material exposed to the higher temperature demonstrated a drop in photosynthetic yield and significant reduction of growth rate. The congregation of modelling and physiological approach corroborate the invasive potential of <em>G. turuturu</em> and indicate higher invasion risk in temperate zones.

Here we present the first extensive study of rafting by marine invertebrates on floating anthropogenic debris in the eastern SPSG. We compared the effect of 9 raft-related categorical predictors on epibiont richness and fouling cover. Raft complexity was the most important predictor of richness. Fouling was dominated by thin crusts and biofilms, with more advanced communities only observed on few items. Fouling cover could not be predicted by any of the categorical factors tested. However, when tested as continuous predictors, raft volume and surface area were significantly correlated with both cover and richness. The most frequently encountered epibionts were common pelagic rafters, particularly <em>Lepas</em> spp., <em>Planes</em> spp., and <em>Jellyella</em> spp. Low fouling cover suggests that the SPSG's hyper-oligotrophic conditions strongly limit fouling growth, while the low frequency of coastal taxa points to the HCS/SPSG nutrient gradient acting as a filter for such organisms.","Rech, S.; Gusmao, J.B.; Kiessling, T.; Hidalgo-Ruz, V.; Meerhoff, E.; Gatta-Rosemary, M.; Moore, C.; de Vine, R.; Thiel, M.",WOS:000605764100096,"Thiel, Martin, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143545,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Oceanic rafting; Plastic pollution; Coastal species; Fouling cover; Community richness; Epibionts,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This knowledge is crucial to evaluate biodiversity patterns, to predict the impact of environmental change and anthropogenic activities, and to design accurate management programs. Here, we investigated the degree to which environmental features, human activities and spatial constraints interact and influence spatial gradients in marine biodiversity using the Western Mediterranean Sea as a model system. Our results revealed that a large fraction of the variability in biodiversity metrics of most marine groups analysed is accounted for by the joint effect of environment and human activities, environment and spatial variables or between all three groups of variables. In other words, major environmental variables and human activities have a collinear spatial structure, and thus an important part of the variation in biodiversity metrics can be attributed to these three groups of explanatory variables. Among pure effects, deviance partitioning results showed that the effect of environmental variables was more evident than the effect of human or spatial variables. The effect of single environmental and human variables considered in the analyses was different for different marine groups. This study contributes to the knowledge of the effects of ecological factors on the spatial distribution of marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea, which is important in the development of more complex spatial analyses. Our results support the hypothesis that the joint effect of different predictor sets can be highly relevant in spatial patterns of biodiversity due to spatial collinearity. Thus, the simultaneous analysis of the relative effect of ecologically important predictor sets is important in preventing misinterpretations of the ecological mechanisms that explain spatial distribution of marine biodiversity.","Navarro, J.; Coll, M.; Cardador, L.; Fernández, A.M.; Bellido, J.M.",WOS:000350540400009,"Bellido, José, J.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2014.12.004,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These can affect the genetic pools of species, including loss of genetic variability and evolutionary potential. In particular, geographically enclosed ecosystems, like the Mediterranean Sea, have a higher risk of suffering species loss and genetic erosion due to barriers to further range shifts and to dispersal. In this study, we address these questions for three habitat-forming seaweed species, <i>Cystoseira tamariscifolia, C. amentacea</i> and <i>C. compressa</i>, throughout their entire ranges in the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions. We aim to 1) describe their population genetic structure and diversity, 2) model the present and predict the future distribution and 3) assess the consequences of predicted future range shifts for their population genetic structure, according to two contrasting future climate change scenarios. A net loss of suitable areas was predicted in both climatic scenarios across the range of distribution of the three species. This loss was particularly severe for <i>C. amentacea</i> in the Mediterranean Sea (less 90% in the most extreme climatic scenario), suggesting that the species could become potentially at extinction risk. For all species, genetic data showed very differentiated populations, indicating low inter-population connectivity, and high and distinct genetic diversity in areas that were predicted to become lost, causing erosion of unique evolutionary lineages. Our results indicated that the Mediterranean Sea is the most threatened region, where future suitable <i>Cystoseira</i> habitats will become more limited. This is likely to have wider ecosystem impacts as there is a lack of species with the same ecological niche and functional role in the Mediterranean. The projected accelerated loss of already fragmented and disturbed populations and the long-term genetic effects highlight the urge for local scale management strategies that sustain the capacity of these habitat-forming species to persist despite climatic impacts while waiting for global emission reductions.","Buonomo, R.; Chefaoui, R.M.; Lacida, R.B.; Engelen, A.H.; Serrão, E.A.; Airoldi, L.",WOS:000434748700014,"Serrão, Ester, E.A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.04.013,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Cystoseira,,,Seaweed; Species distribution modelling; Genetic erosion; Climate change; Conservation; Climatic niche,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is considered an important elasmobranch hotspot where seventy-two elasmobranch species are present in the basin. Despite the recognised importance of elasmobranchs as umbrella species, to date only a small number of marine protected areas have been designated towards their protection. The paucity of spatially-explicit abundance data on elasmobranchs often precludes the designation of these areas to protect these marine predators. Here, we aimed to identify marine areas to protect elasmobranch species by means of a systematic spatial planning approach. We first estimated the spatial distribution of five elasmobranch species (three sharks and two rays) in the western Mediterranean Sea and then applied Marxan decision support tools to find priority marine conservation areas. We found that the five elasmobranchs are distributed in coastal and slope areas of the southern waters of the study area while in the northern region they are abundant in the continental slope and towards offshore waters. Conservation priority areas were identified in the southern part of the western Mediterranean. Adding more complex cost layers and zoning to the analysis did not alter conservation priority areas, confirming such areas are highly consistent and highly important for elasmobranch protection.

In both future scenarios, the models have shown niche erosion on the northern portion of the Brazilian coast and niche gains towards the south. In both scenarios, <i>L. abyssalis</i> populations tend to shift to deeper regions of the reef. The restricted range of occurrence (33,000 km<sup>2</sup>), intense anthropic activities along these beds (e.g., trawling fisheries, oil/gas mining, or removal for agricultural purposes) acting synergically with global warming, may drive this ecosystem to collapse faster than kelp species’ ability to adapt. We propose to classify <i>L. abyssalis</i> as Endangered - (EN) under IUCN criteria, and highlight that long-term monitoring of kelp beds is an urgent need to develop effective conservation initiatives to protect such rare and invaluable ecosystem.","Anderson, A.B.; Assis, J.; Batista, M.B.; Serrão, E.A.; Guabiroba, H.C.; Delfino, S.D.T.; Pinheiro, H.T.; Pimentel, C.R.; Gomes, L.E.O.; Vilar, C.C.; Bernardino, A.F.; Horta, P.A.; Ghisolfi, R.D.; Joyeux, J.-C.",WOS:000663361600003,"Guabiroba, Helder, H.C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105307,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this, potential abiotic (soil, water, and biogeographic parameters) and biotic (brachyuran diversity, gastropod density, tree density, meiofauna density and food availability) drivers of fiddler crabs along the east coast of South Africa (26°S - 34°S) were assessed in multivariate models of fiddler crab presence/absence and abundance. Overall fiddler crab presence/absence was most strongly influenced by biotic variables (i.e. brachyuran diversity, gastropod density, and tree density), while abundance was driven largely by sediment grain size and canopy cover (abiotic variables). Specifically, <i>Austruca occidentalis</i> did not have any strong drivers aside from tree density, both <i>Paraleptuca chlorophthalmus</i> and <i>Tubuca urvillei</i> were influenced strongly by sediment grain size, tree density and crab diversity while <i>Gelasimus hesperiae</i> was influenced by a change in latitude, sediment grain size and meiofauna density. Distribution is not always correlated with latitude or latitudinally-driven variables. Biotic factors seem to play a large role in determining whether or not a species inhabits a specific mangrove habitat while, once established, abiotic factors drive density.

However, due to natural and anthropogenic disturbance, seagrass meadows around the world have declined dramatically in recent decades. Researchers and managers have been calling for increased frequency and accuracy in the mapping of seagrass distributions to benefit seagrass conservation for over a decade, and we argue that a critical advancement in the management of seagrasses could come through increased and iterative model-based mapping of potential habitat as an accessory to seagrass monitoring. We further demonstrate how focus on errors of commission and omission during model interpretation could guide management activities, using the Texas Gulf Coast as a case study representing seagrass habitats worldwide. We used the species distribution modeling program Maxent to predict the location of suitable habitat for each seagrass species along the Texas Coast based on local current velocity, distance from boat launches (i.e., an index of human disturbance), nitrogen, light availability, salinity, and temperature. Models accurately predicted suitable habitat for all seagrass species, including <em>Halodule wrightii</em> (AUC = 0.830 ± 0.032), <em>Thalassia testudinum</em> (AUC = 0.901 ± 0.058), <em>Syringodium filiforme</em> (AUC = 0.911 ± 0.036), <em>Halophila engelmannii</em> (AUC = 0.865 ± 0.092), and <em>Ruppia maritima</em> (AUC = 0.868 ± 0.040). The relative importance of environmental factors differed between models. Distributions for <em>H. wrightii</em> and <em>T. testudinum</em> were most influenced by surface nitrate concentrations. <em>S. filiforme</em>, <em>H. engelmannii</em>, and <em>R. maritima</em> distributions were most influenced by benthic light availability. Human disturbances often lead to elevated nitrate concentrations and decreased benthic light availability, and our models generally predicted a lack of suitable habitat near sites characterized by abundant human development. We considered model errors of commission and omission for each species to identify candidate regions for seagrass transplantation and habitat restoration, respectively. Overall, we believe that the utility of the approach we have developed in the Texas Gulf Coast case study along extends beyond a single study site, and our methods will assist conservation of seagrass meadows worldwide.","Bittner, R.E.; Roesler, E.L.; Barnes, M.A.",WOS:000535863600008,"Bittner, Rachel, R.E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106790,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,Seagrass,,Coastal zone; Conservation; Geographical distribution; Management; Maxent; Seagrass,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Spanish Institute of Oceanography conducts the PELACUS multidisciplinary survey annually to assess pelagic fish stocks and collect information on the status of other ecosystem components, such as oceanographic conditions, phytoplankton, zooplankton and marine megafauna. Using data collected from these surveys, we developed niche models for 14 marine megafauna taxa (3 cetaceans, 10 seabirds and 1 fish) incorporating multi-trophic ecological descriptors collected simultaneously during the surveys alongside the more commonly used oceanographic variables (e.g. chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature). Megafauna niche models were developed by pooling observations from 2007 to 2013 and were found to be driven by mean fish biomass and its variability, in addition to sea surface temperature. Hierarchical clustering identified four distinct megafauna assemblages, the first comprising wide-ranging species and the other three associated with shelf-slope waters in Galicia, coastal/shelf waters in Galicia, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea, respectively. Community-level hotspot areas were found in shelf and shelf-break sectors of Galicia, along with small diversity spots scattered throughout the Cantabrian coastal area.

To address this gap, this investigation assessed temporal changes and depth acclimations of vegetative parameters, such as, shoot length and weight, shoot density, seagrass cover and below- and above-ground biomass, in three near-pristine subtidal <em>Z. marina</em> meadows in western Ireland. Most parameters revealed a marked temporal pattern, displaying clear unimodal responses, with peaks attained in July, intermediate values in April and November, and lowest values observed in January. Moreover, eelgrass cover and density decreased from 76.1 ± 6.5% in shallow meadows to 34 ± 4.5% at greater depths; inversely, other parameters such as shoot biomass or shoot length increased 2–3-fold with depth. Furthermore, annual leaf formation rates and above-ground biomass were estimated and compared to those of eelgrass populations from different latitudes (28°–66°) reported in the literature.

The magnitude of the epiphyte load depends on plant structural and physiological parameters, related to the time available for epiphyte colonization. Yet, the carbonate accumulation is likely to also depend on the carbonate saturation state of seawater (Ω) that tends to decrease as latitude increases due to decreasing temperature and salinity. A decrease in carbonate accumulation with increasing latitude has already been demonstrated for other carbonate producing communities. The aim of this study was to assess whether there was any correlation between latitude and the epiphyte carbonate load and net carbonate production rate on seagrass leaves. Shoots from 8 different meadows of the <em>Zostera</em> genus distributed across a broad latitudinal range (27 °S to up to 64 °N) were sampled along with measurements of temperature and Ω. The Ω within meadows significantly decreased as latitude increased and temperature decreased.

Mean carbonate load and net production rates decreased from subtropical and tropical, warmer regions towards subpolar latitudes, consistent with the decrease in Ω.

Methods suggested to reduce overfitting include increasing regularisation, using only linear and quadratic features, or applying forward selection of predictors using maximum likelihood (ML) methods. We built models using these options to determine environmental suitability within existing aquaculture zones for eight seaweed species, four red (Rhodophyta: Florideophyceae) and four brown (Ochrophyta: Phaeophyceae), that are being investigated for aquaculture in southern Australia. Forward selection models were the most parsimonious, but we encountered failure of ML methods for <em>Pterocladia lucida</em> (Rhodophyta) due to separation. Separation is a known issue for logistic regression and has recently been recognised in maxent models. Separation occurs where a variable, or combination of variables, is a perfect predictor for a binary response, here, species occurrence, and results in ML parameter estimates tending to infinity. One method for obtaining finite parameter estimates under separation is to apply a Cauchy prior distribution for coefficients. We therefore also built models for each species using a Cauchy-prior version of the forward selection method, and found that these models performed similarly to those built with ML methods. Default models achieved marginally higher predictive performance than other options based on training data metrics, but simpler models performed equivalently to, or better than, default models at predicting independent presence-absence test data. Predictive performance using test data varied considerably between species, but the difference in performance between models within each species was generally small. Our results confirm the concern that default maxent models may suffer from over-fitting and poor transferability. Model transferability and interpretability were important for our purpose, hence, based on the principle of parsimony, forward selection models were preferred. We also found that forward selection models retained similar predictive performance to the best model as assessed by each metric, further supporting use of these models. Where ML methods failed due to separation, the use of the Cauchy-prior method was a viable alternative. Predictions for the region of interest (Spencer Gulf, South Australia) were generated using the most parsimonious models, and <em>Solieria robusta</em> (Rhodophyta) showed the highest predicted suitability of the eight candidate species within existing aquaculture zones, especially in northern Spencer Gulf. Predicted suitability was low for the other Rhodophyta considered, while each of the Phaeophyceae showed moderate to high suitability in at least some southern Spencer Gulf aquaculture zones. These model results help to inform selection of the best candidate species and suitable farming areas for future research.","Wiltshire, K.H.; Tanner, J.E.",WOS:000540448700002,"Tanner, Jason, J.E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109071,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,Seaweed,,Maximum entropy; Species distribution modelling; Model selection; Overfitting; Seaweed; Aquaculture,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has a substantial impact on the marine ecology, endangering many local and endemic taxa. Larger foraminifera of the genus <em>Amphistegina</em> are among the most successful invaders, as evidenced by their abundance, ubiquity and wide extension in the Aegean and Ionian Sea. Because global climate change will amplify the entry and range expansion of tropical species in the Mediterranean, the interest in predicting species ranges and forecasting potentially negative impacts on ecosystems has grown substantially. We modeled the potential distribution of <em>Amphistegina</em> spp. and projected the result on future climate scenarios for 2050 and 2100, to predict range extensions of the taxon in future and compare these to range expansions under warm climate as documented in the fossil record. Results indicate that further warming is likely to cause a continued range extension, and predicts dispersal along the central Mediterranean coasts. The average range expansion rates were computed between 11.76 and 13.82 km per year, and are projected to lead to a total range expansion of 525 km (4.71° latitude) and 1035 km (11.87° longitude) in the year 2100. The results corroborate findings from the fossil record showing that some larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera cope well with rising water temperatures and are beneficiaries of warmer climate.

Data show that articulate brachiopods were not homogeneous in terms of species composition, body size, relative abundance and taphonomic signatures along the latitudinal gradient, thus indicating environmental sensitivity. The brachiopod assemblages throughout the gradient are characterized by the dominance of <i>Magellania venosa</i>, especially in the internal sector of the platform, accompanied by <i>Terebratella dorsata</i> towards the slope, and <i>Liothyrella uva</i> in the southern sector. Based on all available information, it appears that the main physical factors that affect the distribution of articulate brachiopods from the PCS were sediment grain size and water flow velocities. Also, in <i>M. venosa</i> shells, sediment grain size is also associated with fragmentation, abrasion and encrusting by invertebrates.

Brazil experiences a combination of low and uneven protection of marine environmets, increasing anthropogenic pressures, climate change, and gaps in information regarding the geographical distribution of many species (Wallacean shortfall). Here, we addressed these issues and present a strategy for identifying priority marine areas for conservation in Brazil that would contribute to increasing species representation and achievement of conservation targets. Within this strategy, we accounted for (i) species range shifts due to climate change and their influence on species distribution, (ii) the lack of species geographical distribution data, and (iii) anthropic pressures on oceans. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 12 threatened starfish species in both present and future (2100) times using Maxent. We also quantified and mapped species range shifts. Second, we developed three conservation spatial solutions and compared the 10% top-ranked areas. The results showed that ENMs had a good performance in representing the distribution of species, even those that had few occurrence records. Our models forecasted a significant range expansion for the majority of species (10 out 12) by 2100. We found that the priority sites covering the top-ranked 10% in the study area identified in ours conservation spatial solutions would protect between 10.41% and 15.88%, on average, of suitable areas for the starfish species. Our results indicated priority sites for conservation less affected by anthropic pressures (~2%) when data on human impacts on oceans were incorporated into the spatial prioritization process. We identified a network of priority marine sites for conservation that minimized human influence and considered the effects of climate change on species distribution. We used threatened starfish species as a case study for illustrating our approach; however, such an approach could be applied to any taxonomic group, which supports the development of more effective conservation actions that represent biodiversity under such threats.","Patrizzi, N.S.; Dobrovolski, R.",WOS:000437057200019,"Patrizzi, Nayla, N.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.05.003,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Ecological niche modeling; Marine protected areas; Conservation planning; Climate change; Human impact; Zonation,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent work showed that mid-latitude habitats along migratory routes may play an important role on the feeding ecology of baleen whales. This study aimed to investigate the function of a mid-latitude habitat for blue (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>), fin (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>) and sei (<i>Balaenoptera borealis</i>) whales occurring in sympatry during spring and summer months and to what extent their environmental niches overlap. We addressed those questions by developing environmental niche models (ENM) for each species and then making pairwise comparisons of niche overlap and relative habitat patch importance among the three species. ENMs were created using sightings from the Azorean Fisheries Observer Program from May to November, between 2004 and 2009, and a set of 18 predictor environmental variables. We then assessed monthly (April–July) overlap among ENMs using a modified Hellinger׳s distance metric (I). Results show that the habitat niches of blue and fin whales are strongly influenced by primary productivity and sea surface temperature and are highly dynamic both spatially and temporally due to the oceanography of the region. Niche overlap analyses show that blue and fin whale environmental niches are similar and that the suitable habitats for the two species have high degree of spatial coincidence. These results in combination suggest that this habitat may function as a mid-latitude feeding ground to both species while conditions are adequate. The sei whale model, on the other hand, did not include variables considered to be proxies for prey distribution and little environmental niche overlap was found between this species and the other two. We argue that these results suggest that the region holds little importance as a foraging habitat for the sei whale.","Prieto, R.; Tobeña, M.; Silva, M.A.",WOS:000405251400012,"Tobeña, Marta, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.07.015,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Environmental niche modeling (ENM); Azores; Mid-Atlantic; Migration; MaxEnt; Niche overlap; Blue whale; Fin whale; Sei whale,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these costs are alleviated for species that commute between the land and the sea, because terrestrial habitats can provide frequent access to fresh water. Here, we investigate how differences in the ecology and physiology of three sea krait species (<em>Laticauda</em> spp.) interact to determine their environmental tolerances and geographic distributions. These three species vary in their relative use of terrestrial versus marine environments, and they display concomitant adaptations to life on land versus at sea. A species with relatively high dehydration rates in seawater (<em>Laticauda colubrina</em>) occupied oceanic areas with low mean salinities, whereas a species with comparatively high rates of transcutaneous evaporative water loss on land (<em>Laticauda semifasciata</em>) occupied regions with low mean temperatures. A third taxon (<em>Laticauda laticaudata</em>) was intermediate in both of these traits, and yet occupied the broadest geographic range. Our results suggest that the abilities of sea kraits to acquire fresh water on land and tolerate dehydration at sea determine their environmental tolerances and geographic distributions. This finding supports the notion that speciation patterns within sea kraits have been driven by interspecific variation in the degree of reliance upon terrestrial versus marine habitats.

Delile, 1813 is a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered as an indicator of environment quality in coastal areas.

The aim of this study was to develop a Species Distribution Model for <em>P. oceanica</em>, to be applied to the Mediterranean North African coast, in order to obtain an estimation of the potential distribution of this species in the region. The Species Distribution Model was calibrated using high resolution data from 4 Mediterranean sites, located in Italy and Spain, as the study area is a data-poor zone with regard to seagrass distribution (i.e. only for some areas detailed distribution maps are available). The model was then validated using available data concerning the North African coast. The probability of presence of the species in a given area was modelled using a binomial generalized linear model as a function of the bathymetry and water transparency, dissolved organic matter, sea surface temperature and salinity, mainly obtained from satellite data. Model selection procedure suggests that water transparency plays a major role, but also other variables, such as salinity and sea surface temperature, are important at larger spatial scales in explaining meadows distribution. The availability of high resolution time-series of input data allowed us to apply the validated model to the whole North African coast. Suitable areas are strongly related to the coastal realm, and cover a large portion of North African coasts, with Tunisian and Lybian ones being the most relevant zones for this species.

We measured the stress response of seaweed samples from four populations (Norway, Denmark, Brittany and Spain) to common-garden heat stress (20 °C–36 °C) in both photosynthetic performance and transcriptomic upregulation of heat shock protein genes. The two stress indicators did not correlate and likely measured different cellular components of the stress response, but both indicators revealed population-specific differences, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. Our results confirmed that thermal extremes will regularly reach physiologically stressful levels in Brittany (France) and further south by the end of the 22nd century. Although heat stress resilience in photosynthetic performance was higher at the species' southern distributional edge in Spain, the <i>hsp</i> expression pattern suggested that this edge-population experienced reduced fitness and limited responsiveness to further stressors. Thus, <i>F. serratus</i> may be unable to mitigate its predicted northward shift and may be at high risk to lose its center of genetic diversity and adaptability in Brittany (France). As it is an important intertidal key species, the disappearance of this seaweed will likely trigger major ecological changes in the entire associated ecosystem.","Jueterbock, A.; Kollias, S.; Smolina, I.; Fernandes, J.M.O.; Coyer, J.A.; Olsen, J.L.; Hoarau, G.",WOS:000333512300009,"Olsen, Jeanine, J.L.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2013.12.008,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Fucus serratus,,,Global warming; Heat stress; Macroalgae; Heat shock protein; Photosynthetic performance,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A quantitative understanding of the impact of industrial activities on the marine environment is thus essential. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a widely applied method for quantifying the environmental impact of products and processes. LCA was originally developed to assess the impacts of land-based industries on mainly terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. As such, impact indicators for major drivers of marine biodiversity loss are currently lacking. We review quantitative approaches for cause–effect assessment of seven major drivers of marine biodiversity loss: climate change, ocean acidification, eutrophication-induced hypoxia, seabed damage, overexploitation of biotic resources, invasive species and marine plastic debris. Our review shows that impact indicators can be developed for all identified drivers, albeit at different levels of coverage of cause–effect pathways and variable levels of uncertainty and spatial coverage. Modeling approaches to predict the spatial distribution and intensity of human-driven interventions in the marine environment are relatively well-established and can be employed to develop spatially-explicit LCA fate factors. Modeling approaches to quantify the effects of these interventions on marine biodiversity are less well-developed. We highlight specific research challenges to facilitate a coherent incorporation of marine biodiversity loss in LCA, thereby making LCA a more comprehensive and robust environmental impact assessment tool. Research challenges of particular importance include i) incorporation of the non-linear behavior of global circulation models (GCMs) within an LCA framework and ii) improving spatial differentiation, especially the representation of coastal regions in GCMs and ocean-carbon cycle models.","Woods, J.S.; Veltman, K.; Huijbregts, M.A.J.; Verones, F.; Hertwich, E.G.",WOS:000374603900007,"Huijbregts, Mark, M.A.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2015.12.033,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Marine biodiversity; Life cycle assessment; Ecosystem quality; Human interventions; Impact pathways; Pollution,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we studied the community composition of zooplankton in the Belgian part of the North Sea over the course of 1 year. We identified zooplankton using both a traditional approach based on morphological characteristics and by metabarcoding of a 650 bp fragment of the V4-V5 region of the 18S rRNA gene using nanopore sequencing. Using long rDNA sequences, we were able to identify several taxa at the species level, across a broad taxonomic scale. Using both methods, we compared community composition and obtained diversity metrics. Diversity indices were not significantly correlated. Metabarcoding allowed for comparisons of diversity and community composition, but not all groups were successfully sequenced. Additionally, some disparities existed between relative abundances of the most abundant taxa based on traditional counts and those based on sequence reads. Overall, we conclude that for zooplankton samples, metabarcoding is capable of detecting taxa with a higher resolution, regardless of developmental stage of the organism.

In the case of Mediterranean Sea, the sub-regional assessment seems optimal to take into account biogeographic differences in species composition and functional characteristics. Previous research has shown that phytoplankton diversity indicators are efficient for reliable environmental assessments, although more effort has been recommended to test these indicators on a wide spatial scale to cover wider gradients of natural and anthropogenic pressures. In this work, a set of eight diversity indices was tested against the pressure levels within a common data set of the structure and abundance of phytoplankton communities from the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas. Expert knowledge was used to define four categories of impacts that take into account partial pressures, such as point and non-point pollution, industry, ports and fisheries. At the level of the common data set, most of the diversity, evenness and dominance indices could only distinguish between the highest level of impact and the rest of impact categories. These indices maintained the distinction between two levels of subsequently dichotomised impacts (no to low impact vs. high impact) across latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. On average, the indices were less sensitive to impacts in the northernmost and westernmost areas than in the southernmost and easternmost areas, although they still showed a significant response. The results also suggest that phytoplankton communities become more uniform and less dominated by a single taxon as sampling depth increases at sites with low impact, while evenness and dominance at impacted sites remain similar at all depths.

Many such species have become well established along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula. However, the lack of information about the distribution of the invaders and the factors determining their occurrence make bioinvasions a difficult issue to manage. Such information is key to enabling the design and implementation of effective management plans. The present study aimed to map the current probability of presence of six invasive macroalgae: <em>Grateloupia turuturu</em>, <em>Asparagopsis armata</em>, <em>Colpomenia peregrina</em>, <em>Sargassum muticum</em>, <em>Undaria pinnatifida,</em> and <em>Codium fragile</em> ssp. <em>fragile</em>. For this purpose, an extensive field survey was carried out along the coast of the north-western Iberian Peninsula. Species distribution models (SDMs) were then used to map the presence probability of these invasive species throughout the study region on the basis of environmental and anthropogenic predictor variables. The southern Galician rias were identified as the main hotspots of macroalgal invasion, with a high probability of occurrence for most of the species considered. Conversely, the probability of presence on the Portuguese coast was generally low. Physico-chemical variables were the most important factors for predicting the distribution of invasive macroalgae contributing between 57.27 and 85.24% to the ensemble models. However, anthropogenic factors (including size of vessels, number of shipping lines, distance from ports, population density, etc.) considerably improved the estimates of the probability of occurrence for most of the target species. This study is one of the few to include anthropogenic factors in SDMs for invasive macroalgae. The findings suggest that management actions aimed at controlling these species should strengthen control and surveillance at ports, particularly in southern Galician rias. Early detection should be of main concern for risk assessment plans on the Portuguese coast.","Blanco, A.; Larrinaga, A.R.; Neto, J.M.; Troncoso, J.S.; Méndez, G.; Domínguez-Lapido, P.; Ovejero, A.; Pereira, L.; Mouga, T.M.; Gaspar, R.; Martínez, B.; Lemos, M.F.L.; Olabarria, C.",WOS:000618048300003,"Larrinaga, Asier, A.R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111861,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Invasive species management; Invasive macroalgae mapping; Species distribution modelling; Anthropogenic predictors,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their structure and composition are driven and shaped by different variables: whilst on the continental shelf physical environmental variables are the main drivers shaping faunal abundance, structure and composition, the deep-sea fauna is most problably driven by biological variables such as predation and competition. Among shelf and deep-sea benthic communities, peracarids (e.g. amphipods and isopods) are one of the most dominant groups, showing high levels of abundance and diversity in both environments. Knowledge on their assemblage structure and composition in the SO remains limited, as well as the knowledge of the environmental variables that influence them. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate peracarid assemblages from the SO continental shelf and deep sea and to assess the main drivers shaping their assemblage structure along a wide bathymetric gradient (from 160 m to about 6000 m depth) and at a large geographic scale. We analysed the spatial distribution of 183,606 peracarids sampled using an epibenthic sledge (EBS) during nine different expeditions in the SO, covering a latitudinal range of 77° to 41° South. Depth was identified as the main driver shaping peracarid abundance pattern, their assemblage structure from the continental shelf (<1499 m) was dissimilar to that from the deep sea (>1500 m). Also, depth was differently correlated with different peracarid orders: while isopod abundances increased with depth, amphipods and mysids were negatively correlated; no correlation was found with cumaceans and tanaidaceans. The dissimilar peracarid assemblage structure between the SO continental shelf and the SO deep sea can be due to the assumption that there are different driving forces shaping benthic assemblages from these two environments (physical variables on the continental shelf, biological interactions in the deep sea). As a result, we also suggest that environmental changes due to climate change (e.g. temperature, ice coverage, productivity) would have different consequences depending on the bathymetric range considered.","Di Franco, D.; Linse, K.; Griffiths, H.J.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000663325100008,"Griffiths, Huw, H.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107832,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Peracarida,,,Macrobenthos; Environmental factors; Benthic environment; Marine invertebrates; Peracarida; Depth,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Southern bioregion of China has the nation’s largest seagrass distribution. However, lack of information on the distribution of seagrasses and the threats they face pose a significant obstacle to their conservation and restoration. Accordingly, a framework for prioritizing conservation and restoration objectives was proposed in the present study. First, we modeled the suitable habitats with MaxEnt, random forest (RF), and ensemble models to obtain a reliable basis map of seagrass distribution. A potentially suitable area of approximately 3,536–4,852&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was mapped in the coastal sea of South China, with the greatest area occurring between 18 °N and 22 °N. The anthropogenic pressures on the seagrass habitat were then estimated using an integrated exposure index consisting of four indicators, namely, population density, fishery economy, aquaculture, and shipping. The results indicated 48% of the coastal seas were under intensive anthropogenic pressures, with a higher exposure in the north than the south. The current conservation status suggests that there is a large seagrass conservation gap. By coupling the two dimensions of habitat suitability and integrated exposure, priority sites for seagrass management in South China were identified for the first time. Our work will not only provide basic information for coastal ecosystem management, but also serve as a tool to support the conservation and restoration planning of seagrass, thus, ultimately promoting the sustainability of seagrasses habitats.","Hu, W.; Zhang, D.; Chen, B.; Liu, X.; Ye, X.; Jiang, Q.; Zheng, X.; Du, J.; Chen, S.",WOS:000684999900003,"Hu, Wenjia, W.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107960,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Seagrass conservation; Exposure assessment; Habitat sustainability; Conservation and restoration planning,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To start filling this gap, we attempt to provide a global overview of reef-fish diversity around the numerous islands of the region. We evaluated species richness, the abundance and biomass, and the functional diversity of the fish assemblages for the major islands of the GC. We first highlight that the southwestern part of the central GC is the hotspot of reef-fishes diversity within the GC, in terms of species richness, functional diversity, and fish abundance. We then found out an important functional divergence between fish assemblages of northern and southern regions. The fish biomass of each region is dominated by different species, characterised by different ecological traits (the opposite of functional convergence). This functional divergence may be explained by an important oceanographic heterogeneity along the latitudinal axis of the GC. The northern part shows larger climate fluctuations while the southern part is more tropical and climatically stable. Such functional divergence is a biodiversity facet to take into account when determining the sites to focus conservation action. In the GC, this criterion allows the importance of some sites to be highlighted to preserve the legacy of the reef-fishes, despite their lower diversity levels.","Olivier, D.; Loiseau, N.; Petatán-Ramírez, D.; Trujillo-Millán, O.; Suárez-Castillo, A.N.; Torre, J.; Munguía-Vega, A.; Reyes-Bonilla, H.",WOS:000454994500062,"Munguía-Vega, Adrián, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e00506,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Biodiversity; Biologically important area; Functional traits; Marine protected area; Sea of Cortez; Tropical Eastern Pacific,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lakshadweep–Maldives–Chagosarchipelago (LMC) forms one of the largest chains of atoll systems in the world, and due to remoteness from the mainland, its islands boast a unique set of flora and fauna. The coral reefs of these tropical islands are highly vulnerable to stressors such as climate change, overfishing, monsoon runoff, and ocean acidification. To understand and manage these sensitive ecosystems, knowledge about the existing coral cover and distribution patterns are essential. In the present study, habitat modelling of the two corals <em>Acropora muricata</em> (Linnaeus, 1758) and <em>Porites lutea</em> (Milne Edwards &amp; Haime, 1851) were carried out using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to predict the probability of occurrence using remotely sensed environmental variables as predictors. The average test AUC values of 0.980 and 0.974, respectively, for <em>A. muricata</em> and <em>P. lutea</em> as estimated by MaxEnt shows that the model performance for both the species is outstanding. The average uncertainty (standard deviation) was about 0.012 and 0.021 respectively. It is found that the bathymetry is the variable having the highest contribution followed by Calcite and Phosphate for the distribution of both the species. The results of this study throw light on the probable occurrence of coral reefs in many of the hitherto unknown areas, especially the submerged banks and seamounts in the region. Much of these areas are less explored and have strategic positional advantages in increasing the ecosystem connectivity of the region. Furthermore, the relationship between coral distribution and the environmental variables as predicted by this study will be valuable in future conservation activities and designing marine protected areas.","Anakha, M.; Sreenath, K.R.; Joshi, K.K.; Shelton, P.; Nameer, P.O.",WOS:000615949100003,"Anakha, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.101619,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,"Acropora muricata, ""Porites lutea""",,,Maximum Entropy; MaxEnt; Species distribution model,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the traits associated with alien introduction has been largely restricted to comparing indigenous and alien species or comparing alien species that differ in abundance or impact. However, a more complete understanding may emerge when the entire pool of potential alien species is used as a control, information that is rarely available. In the eastern Mediterranean, the marine environment is undergoing an unparalleled species composition transformation, as a flood of aliens have entered from the Red Sea following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. In this study, we compile data on species traits, geographical distribution, and environmental affinity of the entire pool of reef-associated fish species in the Red Sea and more generally across the Indo-Pacific. We use this extensive data to identify the prime characteristics separating Red Sea species that have become alien in the Mediterranean from those that have not. We find that alien species occupy a larger range of environments in their native ranges, explaining their ability to colonize the seasonal Mediterranean. Red Sea species that naturally experience high maximum temperatures in their native range have a high probability of becoming alien. Thus, contrary to predictions of an accelerating number of aliens following increased water temperatures, hotter summers in this region may prevent the establishment of many alien species. We further find that ecological trait diversity of alien species is substantially more evenly spaced and more divergent than random samples from the pool of Red Sea species, pointing at additional processes, such as competition, promoting ecological diversity among alien species. We use these results to provide a first quantitative ranking of the potential of Red Sea species to become established in the eastern Mediterranean.","Belmaker, J.; Parravicini, V.; Kulbicki, M.",WOS:000317284700004,"Belmaker, Jonathan, J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12132,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show a positive exponential relationship between the current area of habitat that coral species occupy and the predicted area of habitat that they will occupy by 2100. There was considerable decoupling between scales of response, however, and with further ocean warming some ‘winners’ at local scales will likely become ‘losers’ at regional scales. We predicted that nine of the 12 species examined will lose 24–50% of their current habitat. Most reductions are predicted to occur between the latitudes 5–15°, in both hemispheres. Yet when we modeled a 1 °C capacity to adapt, two ubiquitous species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i> and <i>Acropora digitifera</i>, were predicted to retain much of their current habitat. By contrast, the thermally tolerant <i>Porites lobata</i> is expected to increase its current distribution by 14%, particularly southward along the east and west coasts of Australia. Five areas were identified as Indian Ocean refugia, and seven areas were identified as Pacific Ocean refugia for reef corals under climate change.

Yet global climate models reveal a heterogeneously warming ocean, which has initiated a search for refuges, where corals may survive in the near future. We hypothesized that some turbid nearshore environments may act as climate-change refuges, shading corals from the harmful interaction between high sea-surface temperatures and high irradiance. We took a hierarchical Bayesian approach to determine the expected distribution of 12 coral species in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, between the latitudes 37°N and 37°S, under representative concentration pathway 8.5 (W m<sup>−2</sup>) by 2100. The turbid nearshore refuges identified in this study were located between latitudes 20–30°N and 15–25°S, where there was a strong coupling between turbidity and tidal fluctuations. Our model predicts that turbidity will mitigate high temperature bleaching for 9% of shallow reef habitat (to 30 m depth) – habitat that was previously considered inhospitable under ocean warming. Our model also predicted that turbidity will protect some coral species more than others from climate-change-associated thermal stress. We also identified locations where consistently high turbidity will likely reduce irradiance to <250 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and predict that 16% of reef-coral habitat ≤30 m will preclude coral growth and reef development. Thus, protecting the turbid nearshore refuges identified in this study, particularly in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the northern Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands (Japan), eastern Vietnam, western and eastern Australia, New Caledonia, the northern Red Sea, and the Arabian Gulf, should become part of a judicious global strategy for reef-coral persistence under climate change.","Cacciapaglia, C.; van Woesik, R.",WOS:000370491400016,"van Woesik, Robert, R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13166,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon, known as the temperature–size rule, has important consequences for global fisheries, whereby ocean warming is predicted to result in smaller fish and reduced biomass. However, the generality of this phenomenon and the mechanisms that drive it in natural populations remain unresolved. In this study, we document the maximal size of 74 fish species along a steep temperature gradient in the Mediterranean Sea and find strong support for the temperature–size rule. Importantly, we additionally find that size reduction in active fish species is dramatically larger than for more sedentary species. As the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption depends on activity levels, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen is a limiting factor shaping the temperature–size rule in fishes. These results suggest that ocean warming will result in a sharp, but uneven, reduction in fish size that will cause major shifts in size-dependent interactions. Moreover, warming will have major implications for fisheries as the main species targeted for harvesting will show the most substantial declines in biomass.","van Rijn, I.; Buba, Y.; DeLong, J.; Kiflawi, M.; Belmaker, J.",WOS:000406812100020,"Kiflawi, Moshe, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13688,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the marine environment, the major anthropogenic drivers of change comprise exploitation, invasion by nonindigenous species, and climate change. However, the magnitude of these stressors has been widely debated and we lack empirical estimates of their relative importance. In this study, we focused on Eastern Mediterranean, a region exposed to an invasion of species of Red Sea origin, extreme climate change, and high fishing pressure. We estimated changes in fish abundance using two fish trawl surveys spanning a 20-year period, and correlated these changes with estimated sensitivity of species to the different stressors. We estimated sensitivity to invasion using the trait similarity between indigenous and nonindigenous species; sensitivity to fishing using a published composite index based on the species’ life-history; and sensitivity to climate change using species climatic affinity based on occurrence data. Using both a meta-analytical method and random forest analysis, we found that for shallow-water species the most important driver of population size changes is sensitivity to climate change. Species with an affinity to warm climates increased in relative abundance and species with an affinity to cold climates decreased suggesting a strong response to warming local sea temperatures over recent decades. This decrease in the abundance of cold-water-associated species at the trailing “warm” end of their distribution has been rarely documented. Despite the immense biomass of nonindigenous species and the presumed high fishing pressure, these two latter factors seem to have only a minor role in explaining abundance changes. The decline in abundance of indigenous species of cold-water origin indicates a future major restructuring of fish communities in the Mediterranean in response to the ongoing warming, with unknown impacts on ecosystem function.","Givan, O.; Edelist, D.; Sonin, O.; Belmaker, J.",WOS:000426506100007,"Givan, Or, O.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13835,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous research has mainly focused on how species' ranges will respond to changing ocean temperatures, without accounting for other environmental covariates that could affect future distribution patterns. Here, we integrate habitat suitability modeling approaches, a high-resolution global climate model projection, and detailed fishery-independent and -dependent faunal datasets from one of the most extensively monitored marine ecosystems—the U.S. Northeast Shelf. We project the responses of 125 species in this region to climate-driven changes in multiple oceanographic factors (e.g., ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height) and seabed characteristics (i.e., rugosity and depth). Comparing model outputs based on ocean temperature and seabed characteristics to those that also incorporated salinity and sea surface height (proxies for primary productivity and ocean circulation features), we explored how an emphasis on ocean temperature in projecting species' range shifts can impact assessments of species' climate vulnerability. We found that multifactor habitat suitability models performed better in explaining and predicting species historical distribution patterns than temperature-based models. We also found that multifactor models provided more concerning assessments of species' future distribution patterns than temperature-based models, projecting that species' ranges will largely shift northward and become more contracted and fragmented over time. Our results suggest that using ocean temperature as a primary determinant of range shifts can significantly alter projections, masking species' climate vulnerability, and potentially forestalling proactive management.","McHenry, J.; Welch, H.; Lester, S.E.; Saba, V.",WOS:000487849500001,"Saba, Vincent, V.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14828,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How this variation in biosecurity affects the invasion risks posed to the countries involved is unclear. We aimed to improve the understanding of how the biosecurity of a country influences that of its neighbours. We developed six scenarios that describe biological invasions in regions with contiguous countries. Using data from alien species databases, socio-economic and biodiversity data and species distribution models, we determined where 86 of 100 of the world's worst invasive species are likely to invade and have a negative impact in the future. Information on the capacity of countries to prevent invasions was used to determine whether such invasions could be avoided. For the selected species, we predicted 2,523 discrete invasions, most of which would have significant negative impacts and are unlikely to be prevented. Of these invasions, approximately a third were predicted to spread from the country in which the species first establishes to neighbouring countries where they would cause significant negative impacts. Most of these invasions are unlikely to be prevented as the country of first establishment has a low capacity to prevent invasions or has little incentive to do so as there will be no impact in that country. Regional biosecurity is therefore essential to prevent future harmful biological invasions. In consequence, we propose that the need for increased regional co-operation to combat biological invasions be incorporated in global biodiversity targets.","Faulkner, K.T.; Robertson, M.P.; Wilson, J.R.U.",WOS:000513274600001,"Wilson, John, J.R.U.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15006,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marine ectotherms experience temperatures closer to their upper thermal limits due to the paucity of temporary thermal refugia compared to those available to terrestrial organisms. Thermal limits of marine ectotherms also vary among species and trophic levels, making their trophic interactions more prone to changes as oceans warm. We assessed how temperature affects reef fish trophic interactions in the Western Atlantic and modeled projections of changes in fish occurrence, biomass, and feeding intensity across latitudes due to climate change. Under ocean warming, tropical reefs will experience diminished trophic interactions, particularly herbivory and invertivory, potentially reinforcing algal dominance in this region. Tropicalization events are more likely to occur in the northern hemisphere, where feeding by tropical herbivores is predicted to expand from the northern Caribbean to extratropical reefs. Conversely, feeding by omnivores is predicted to decrease in this area with minor increases in the Caribbean and southern Brazil. Feeding by invertivores declines across all latitudes in future predictions, jeopardizing a critical trophic link. Most changes are predicted to occur by 2050 and can significantly affect ecosystem functioning, causing dominance shifts and the rise of novel ecosystems.","Inagaki, K.Y.; Pennino, M.G.; Floeter, S.R.; Hay, M.E.; Longo, G.O.",WOS:000575088900001,"Inagaki, Kelly, K.Y.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15346,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use seascape genomics to characterise genetic diversity, structure and gene-environmental associations in a dominant forest-forming seaweed, <i>Phyllospora comosa</i>, along its entire latitudinal (12° latitude), and thermal (~14°C) range. <i>Phyllospora</i> showed high connectivity throughout its central range, with evidence of genetic structure and potential selection associated with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) at its rear and leading edges. Rear and leading-edge populations harboured only half the genetic diversity of central populations. By modelling genetic turnover as a function of SST, we assessed the genomic vulnerability across <i>Phyllospora's</i> distributional range under climate change scenarios. Despite low diversity, range-edge populations were predicted to harbour beneficial adaptations to marginal conditions and overall adaptability of the species may be compromised by their loss. Assisted gene flow from range edge populations may be required to enhance adaptation and increase resilience of central and leading-edge populations under warming oceans.

Spatial niche partitioning is known to occur among species that breed sympatrically, but is less apparent during the non-breeding period when there is increased potential for overlap among closely related species from neighbouring island groups. This applies to several species of prion, <i>Pachyptila</i> spp., in the Southern Ocean; although extremely abundant, their at-sea distribution was virtually unknown because they are difficult to distinguish while at sea. To understand spatial niche partitioning at large scales, we investigated the year-round distribution of thin-billed prions (<i>Pachyptila belcheri</i>) from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and Antarctic prions (<i>Pachyptila desolata</i>) from South Georgia.</p>         </section>            <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jbi12008-sec-0002"">                  <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jbi12008-sec-0002-title""> Location</h3>                  <p>South Atlantic Ocean.</p>         </section>            <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jbi12008-sec-0003"">                  <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jbi12008-sec-0003-title""> Methods</h3>                  <p>Recently, geolocation devices have become small enough to be deployed on small seabirds.

This study evaluated the increasing densities of <i>C. limbata</i> populations in Santa Catarina State shoreline. Two recent expansions, northwards to São Paulo State and southwards to Rio Grande do Sul State, are discussed, and a niche model of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was performed to evaluate suitable <i>C. limbata</i> habitats. Brazilian populations are established and significantly increasing in most sites where the species has been detected. The distributional boundaries predicted by the model are clearly wider than their known range of occurrence, evidencing environmental suitability in both hemispheres from areas where the species still does not occur.

The algal substrate reduction was accompanied by the reduction in the abundance and density of all associated faunal groups. However, the increase or maintenance of the algal substrate was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of peracarids, due to the dominance of herbivorous species, while other taxonomic groups like mollusks and polychaetes decreased or maintained their abundance, although with higher species evenness of gastropods when alga increases.

Upwelling related variables are the best overall predictors of biogeographic structure (nutrient concentrations, sea-surface temperature, upwelling/downwelling seasonal switch index), but the relative importance of predictors is geographically variable and top predictors are dependent on the type of larval dispersal. Upwelling related variables are more important to predict biogeographic structure for invertebrates with lower-medium dispersal capabilities and algae, whereas species with high larval dispersal (planktotrophic) are better predicted by a different subset of variables (i.e. salinity, precipitation seasonality). Our results lend support to the influence of coastal upwelling in structuring biogeographic patterns and highlight the potential for climate change-induced alterations of upwelling regimes to profoundly affect biodiversity at biogeographic scales.","Fenberg, P.B.; Menge, B.A.; Raimondi, P.T.; Rivadeneira, M.M.",WOS:000348763100009,"Fenberg, Phillip, P.B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.00880,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a gridded distribution database and phylogenetic information, we compared the phylogenetic structure of assemblages for three tropical reef fish families (Labridae: wrasses, Pomacentridae: damselfishes and Chaetodontidae: butterflyfishes) using the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We then related these indices to contemporary and historical environmental conditions of coral reefs using spatial regression analyses. Higher levels of phylogenetic clustering were found for fish assemblages in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and more particularly when considering the NTI index. The phylogenetic structure of the Pomacentridae, and to a lower extent of the Chaeotodontidae and Labridae, was primarily associated with the location of refugia during the Quaternary period. Phylogenetic clustering in the IAA may partly result from vicariance events associated with coral reef fragmentation during the glacial periods of the Quaternary. Variation in the patterns among fish families further suggest that dispersal abilities may have interacted with past habitat availability in shaping the phylogenetic structure of tropical reef fish assemblages.","Leprieur, F.; Colosio, S.; Descombes, P.; Parravicini, V.; Kulbicki, M.; Cowman, P.F.; Bellwood, D.R.; Mouillot, D.; Pellissier, L.",WOS:000383635600002,"Parravicini, Valeriano, V.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01638,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subtropical environments, where many species overlap at their range margins, are cooler, more light-limited and variable than tropical environments. It is thus likely that species respond variably to these multi-stressor regimes and that factors other than mean climatic conditions drive biodiversity patterns. Here, we tested these hypotheses for scleractinian corals at their high-latitude range limits in eastern Australia and investigated the role of mean climatic conditions and of parameters linked to abiotic stress in explaining the distribution and abundance of different groups of species. We found that environmental drivers varied among taxa and were predominantly linked to abiotic stress. The distribution and abundance of tropical species and gradients in species richness (alpha diversity) and turnover (beta diversity) were best explained by light limitation, whereas minimum temperatures and temperature fluctuations best explained gradients in subtropical species, species nestedness and functional diversity. Variation in community structure (considering species composition and abundance) was most closely linked to the combined thermal and light regime. Our study demonstrates the role of abiotic stress in controlling the distribution of species towards their high-latitude range limits and suggests that, at biogeographic transition zones, robust predictions of the impacts of climate change require approaches that account for various aspects of physiological stress and for species abundances and characteristics. These findings support the hypothesis that abiotic stress controls high-latitude range limits and caution that projections solely based on mean temperature could underestimate species’ vulnerabilities to climate change.","Sommer, B.; Beger, M.; Harrison, P.L.; Babcock, R.C.; Pandolfi, J.M.",WOS:000426725400005,"Sommer, Brigitte, B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02986,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our primary objective was to predict the climate-change induced range-shift of <i>Fucus distichus</i>, the dominant canopy-forming macroalga in the Arctic and subarctic rocky intertidal. More specifically, we asked: which Arctic/subarctic and cold-temperate shores of the northern hemisphere will display the greatest distributional change of <i>F</i>.&nbsp;<i>distichus</i> and how will this affect niche overlap with seaweeds from temperate regions? We used the program MAXENT to develop correlative ecological niche models with dominant range-limiting factors and 169 occurrence records. Using three climate-change scenarios, we projected habitat suitability of <i>F</i>.&nbsp;<i>distichus</i> – and its niche overlap with three dominant temperate macroalgae – until year 2200. Maximum sea surface temperature was identified as the most important factor in limiting the fundamental niche of <i>F</i>.&nbsp;<i>distichus</i>. Rising temperatures were predicted to have low impact on the species' southern distribution limits, but to shift its northern distribution limits poleward into the high Arctic. In cold-temperate to subarctic regions, new areas of niche overlap were predicted between <i>F</i>.&nbsp;<i>distichus</i> and intertidal macroalgae immigrating from the south. While climate-change threatens intertidal seaweeds in warm-temperate regions, seaweed meadows will likely flourish in the Arctic intertidal.

We investigated whether species-specific responses are associated with life-history traits. We collected a database of coral reef fish distribution together with life-history traits for the Indo-Pacific Ocean. We ran species distribution models (SDMs) on 3,725 tropical reef fish species using contemporary environmental factors together with a variable describing isolation from stable coral reef areas during the Quaternary. We quantified the variance explained independently by isolation from stable areas in the SDMs and related it to a set of species traits including body size and mobility. The variance purely explained by isolation from stable coral reef areas on the distribution of extant coral reef fish species largely varied across species. We observed a triangular relationship between the contribution of isolation from stable areas in the SDMs and body size. Species, whose distribution is more associated with historical changes, occurred predominantly in the Indo-Australian archipelago, where the mean size of fish assemblages is the lowest. Our results suggest that the legacy of habitat changes of the Quaternary is still detectable in the extant distribution of many fish species, especially those with small body size and the most sedentary. Because they were the least able to colonize distant habitats in the past, fish species with smaller body size might have the most pronounced lags in tracking ongoing climate change.","Ottimofiore, E.; Albouy, C.; Leprieur, F.; Descombes, P.; Kulbicki, M.; Mouillot, D.; Parravicini, V.; Pellissier, L.",WOS:000397458000030,"Ottimofiore, Eduardo, E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2800,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adjacent Arabian Sea is characterized by a sharper environmental gradient, ranging from extensive coral cover and warm temperatures in the southwest, to sparse coral cover, cooler temperatures, and seasonal upwelling in the northeast. Reef fish, however, are not confined to these seas, with some Red Sea fishes extending varying distances into the northern Arabian Sea, while their pelagic larvae are presumably capable of much greater dispersal. These species must therefore cope with a diversity of conditions that invoke the possibility of steep clines in natural selection.

We then decompose biodiversity into 24 species assemblages and investigate their spatial distribution using ecological units and ecoregions recently proposed. Finally, we propose a descriptive method, which we call the environmental chromatogram, to characterize the environmental signature of each plankton assemblage. The method is based on a graphic that identifies where species of an assemblage aggregate along an environmental gradient composed of multiple ecological dimensions. The decomposition of the biodiversity into species assemblages allows us to show (a) that most marine regions of the North Atlantic are composed of coenoclines (i.e., gradients of biocoenoses or communities) and (b) that the overlapping spatial distribution of assemblages is the result of their environmental signatures.

We use ensemble species distribution models of four coral species (<i>Porites rus</i>, <i>Porites lobata</i>, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i> and <i>Acropora digitifera</i>) to gauge potential geographic differences in gross carbonate production. Net carbonate production was estimated by considering erosional rates of ocean acidification, increasing cyclone intensity, local pollution, fishing pressure and the projected burdens of increases in SSTs (under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) through to the year 2100. Our models predict that only 4 ± 0.1% (~60 000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs are projected to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100 under RCP 8.5 – most of which will be located near the Equator. However, with drastic reductions in emissions (under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0 Wm<sup>−2</sup>), we predict that 15 ± 0.3% (~250 000 km<sup>2</sup>) (under RCP 4.5 Wm<sup>−2</sup>) and 12 ± 0.7% (~200 000 km<sup>2</sup>) (under RCP 6.0 Wm<sup>−2</sup>) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs, have the potential to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100. Yet the burdens of fishing pressure and its cascading effects are projected to be responsible for substantial reef erosion, nearly halving the number of reefs able to keep up with sea-level rise. If action is taken immediately and emissions are drastically reduced to RCPs 4.5 or 6.0 Wm<sup>−2</sup>, and reef management reduces the burdens of local pollution and fishing pressure, then our model predicts that 21–27% (~350 000–470 000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Indo-Pacific coral reefs – most of which will be located near the Equator – would have the potential to keep up with sea-level rise by the year 2100.","Cacciapaglia, C.W.; van Woesik, R.",WOS:000520524600001,"Cacciapaglia, Christopher, C.W.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04949,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although studies have evaluated effects of rising temperatures on marine species, few have looked at these impacts along with other environmental drivers over long time periods. In this study, we associate long-term density of blacklip abalone to changing oceanographic conditions in a climate change ‘hot-spot’ off southeast Australia. We downscaled and hind-casted existing hydrodynamic models to provide information on waves and currents over 25 yr and used this information to run biophysical connectivity models. We combined the connectivity models with 21 yr of data on abalone density, temperature, seafloor habitat, and the effects of a disease outbreak in an machine learning modeling approach to develop a spatio-temporal model of abalone density. We found that the combination of temperature, connectivity, current speed, wave orbital velocity, fishery catch, depth, reef structure and a disease outbreak explain 70% of variation in abalone density and allowed us to create 30 m resolution predictive grids with 75% accuracy. An emerging hotspot analysis run on the individual predictive grids from each year detected a predominance of low-density grids across the region, with 49.5% of cells classified as cold spots, 14.3% as hotspots and 36.2% with no significant patterns observed. This type of spatio-temporal analysis provides important insights into how changing environmental conditions are impacting density in an important fishery species, allowing for better adaptive management in the face of future climate change.","Young, M.A.; Treml, E.A.; Beher, J.; Fredle, M.; Gorfine, H.; Swearer, S.E.; Ierodiaconou, D.",WOS:000544487400010,"Beher, Jutta, J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05181,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because some invasions originate from a geographically restricted portion of the native species range and its climatic niche, it is possible that the frequency, direction, and magnitude of phenotypic evolution during invasion have been underestimated. We explored the utility of niche shift analyses in the red seaweed <i>Gracilaria vermiculophylla</i>, which expanded its range from the northeastern coastline of Japan to North America, Europe, and northwestern Africa within the last 100&nbsp;years. A genetically informed climatic niche shift analysis indicates that native source populations occur in colder and highly seasonal habitats, while most non-native populations typically occur in warmer, less seasonal habitats. This climatic niche expansion predicts that non-native populations evolved greater tolerance for elevated heat conditions relative to native source populations. We assayed 935 field-collected and 325 common-garden thalli from 40 locations, and as predicted, non-native populations had greater tolerance for ecologically relevant extreme heat (40°C) than did Japanese source populations. Non-native populations also had greater tolerance for cold and low-salinity stresses relative to source populations. The importance of local adaptation to warm temperatures during invasion was reinforced by evolution of parallel clines: Populations from warmer, lower-latitude estuaries had greater heat tolerance than did populations from colder, higher-latitude estuaries in both Japan and eastern North America. We conclude that rapid evolution plays an important role in facilitating the invasion success of this and perhaps other non-native marine species. Genetically informed ecological niche analyses readily generate clear predictions of phenotypic shifts during invasions and may help to resolve debate over the frequency of niche conservatism versus rapid adaptation during invasion.","Sotka, E.E.; Baumgardner, A.W.; Bippus, P.M.; Destombe, C.; Duermit, E.A.; Endo, H.; Flanagan, B.A.; Kamiya, M.; Lees, L.E.; Murren, C.J.; Nakaoka, M.; Shainker, S.J.; Strand, A.E.; Terada, R.; Valero, M.; Weinberger, F.; Krueger-Hadfield, S.A.",WOS:000433572400017,"Sotka, Erik, E.E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12592,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a combination of environmental variables and landscape metrics to perform a suite of predictive algorithms which enables examination of the niche and find suitable habitats for the species. The most relevant environmental variables defining the distribution of <i>C. nodosa</i> were sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity. We found suitable habitats at SST from 5.8 °C to 26.4 °C and salinity ranging from 17.5 to 39.3. Optimal values of mean winter wave height ranged between 1.2 and 1.5 m, while waves higher than 2.5 m seemed to limit the presence of the species. The influence of nutrients and pH, despite having weight on the models, was not so clear in terms of ranges that confine the distribution of the species. Landscape metrics able to capture variation in the coastline enhanced significantly the accuracy of the models, despite the limitations caused by the scale of the study. We found potential suitable areas not occupied by the seagrass mainly in coastal regions of North Africa and the Adriatic coast of Italy. The present study describes the realized and potential distribution of a seagrass species, providing the first global model of the factors that can be shaping the environmental niche of <i>C. nodosa</i> throughout its range. We identified the variables constraining its distribution as well as thresholds delineating its environmental niche. Landscape metrics showed promising prospects for the prediction of coastal species dependent on the shape of the coast. By contrasting predictive approaches, we defined the variables affecting the distributional areas that seem unsuitable for <i>C. nodosa</i> as well as those suitable habitats not occupied by the species.

To understand large-scale variation in biotic interactions, we quantify consumption (predation and herbivory) along 2500 km of the Chilean coast (19°S–42°S). We deployed tethering assays at ten sites with three different baits: the crab <i>Petrolisthes laevigatus</i> as living prey for predators, dried squid as dead prey for predators/scavengers, and the kelp <i>Lessonia</i> spp. for herbivores. Underwater videos were used to characterize the consumer community and identify those species consuming baits. The species composition of consumers, frequency of occurrence, and maximum abundance (MaxN) of crustaceans and the blenniid fish <i>Scartichthys</i> spp. varied across sites. Consumption of <i>P. laevigatus</i> and kelp did not vary with latitude, while squid baits were consumed more quickly at mid and high latitudes. This is likely explained by the increased occurrence of predatory crabs, which was positively correlated with consumption of squidpops after 2 h. Crabs, rather than fish, were the principal consumers of squid baits (91% of all recorded predation events) at sites south of 30°S. Fish and crustaceans preyed in similar proportion on <i>P. laevigatus</i>, with most fish predation events at northern sites. The absence of any strong latitudinal patterns in consumption rate of tethered prey is likely due to redundancy among consumers across the latitudinal range, with crustaceans gaining in importance with increasing latitude, possibly replacing fish as key predators.","Musrri, C.A.; Poore, A.G.B.; Hinojosa, I.A.; Macaya, E.C.; Pacheco, A.S.; Pérez-Matus, A.; Pino-Olivares, O.; Riquelme-Pérez, N.; Stotz, W.B.; Valdivia, N.; Villalobos, V.; Thiel, M.",WOS:000495633200004,"Pacheco, Aldo, A.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-019-3587-0,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the discovery of Australia’s southernmost hermatypic corals and explore novel dynamics facilitating the presence and extent of high-latitude coral communities. Examination of 607 shallow reef sites across temperate Australia revealed hard corals to be negatively associated with increasing kelp bed cover, but positively associated with increasing sea surface temperature, herbivorous fishes, grazing sea urchins, and increasing cover of turf algae, which proliferates in the absence of kelp. However, the nature of these effects varied across different regions of temperate Australia consistent with regional variability in the presence/absence of key functional groups for temperate reefs, such as guilds of subtropical herbivorous fishes and/or prevalence of overgrazing sea urchins. For the southernmost coral communities, in eastern Bass Strait Tasmania, the dominant reef-building coral <i>Plesiastrea versipora</i> was negatively associated with kelp and positively associated with the southward range-extending diadematid sea urchin <i>Centrostephanus rodgersii</i>, which has caused extensive kelp bed overgrazing since first locally reported in 1974. Facilitation of coral establishment was strongest on overgrazed barrens where urchin density was relatively low, but sufficient to maintain the reef kelp-free, while corals were less frequent at high urchin densities and completely absent from barrens colonised by intensively grazing limpets. In contrast to tropical Australian coral reefs and other temperate regions (e.g. Western Australia), assays of herbivory confirmed sea urchin grazing, not herbivorous fishes, as chiefly responsible for kelp consumption within this high-latitude system. Size structure of <i>P. versipora</i> in eastern Bass Strait was dominated by small colonies (~ 20 cm<sup>2</sup>), suggesting an expanding population at the poleward edge of the species’ range. Nevertheless, colonies up to a maximum area of 500 cm<sup>2</sup> were observed, which are likely > 40 yrs old based on growth rates established in warmer waters. This research highlights novel patterns and processes structuring the interface between subtropical and temperate reef communities under climate change and specifically highlights the role of herbivores in releasing corals from competition with kelp under warming ocean regimes.","Ling, S.D.; Barrett, N.S.; Edgar, G.J.",WOS:000452084700009,"Ling, S.D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-018-1728-4,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many organisms live in remote areas of the ocean and inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments. Such amphibious lifestyle poses analytical difficulties due to broad distribution and scale of coral reefs. Ecological niche modeling is a widely used technique that allows to estimate the environmental set of conditions (niche) in which organisms can survive and reproduce. Estimating the distributions of species with complex life histories (i.e., dependent on various natural resources) at broad geographic scales is crucial, as many of these taxa are threatened (i.e., amphibians, aquatic reptiles, birds, and mammals). However, distribution estimates of such species remain challenging; thus, here we propose an approach to account for marine and terrestrial environmental domains to estimate the distribution of amphibious species. We also test whether inclusion of both environments leads to improved estimates of these species’ distributions. First we calibrated ecological niche models for marine and terrestrial domains separately, and subsequently we outlined a method to combine the marine–terrestrial potential distributions by integrating estimates of the two ecological niches into a single predictive model. Our ecological niche models produced inaccurate distribution predictions of species with amphibious life histories when only one of the environments was used in model calibration. When both aquatic and terrestrial environments were included, our models predicted narrower and more accurate potential distributions. Accounting for the dual environments involved in shaping the niches of amphibious species and their distributions is essential for studying the ecology and proposing conservation management actions for the species studied here. Models that take into account only a subset of the environmental factors are prone to overestimating species’ distributions and should be interpreted with caution.","Gherghel, I.; Brischoux, F.; Nyári, A.S.; Papes, M.",WOS:000543128700001,"Brischoux, Francois, F.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01937-3,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The largest changes are seen in biogeographic transition zones, such as subtropical reef communities, where species range shifts are already causing substantial community reorganisation. This causes functional changes in communities over subtropical latitudes, though a baseline functional understanding remains elusive for many taxa. One key marine taxon are molluscs, which provide many ecosystem services, are important prey for fishes and are also fisheries targets themselves, but remain largely unstudied. Here, we examine the trait composition, functional diversity, and functional redundancy of mollusc assemblages along the tropical-to-temperate transition in Japan (25° to 35° Northern latitude). Specifically, we use a trait database of 88 mollusc species from 31 subtropical reefs along the Pacific coast of Japan to show that trait composition of mollusc assemblages changes continuously along the latitudinal gradient. We discover that functional diversity of mollusc assemblages decreases with increasing latitude, a pattern associated with declines in functional dispersion. Moreover, we find a clear distinction between tropical and subtropical mollusc assemblages, with substrate-attached, suspension feeding bivalves more abundant in the tropics and free-living gastropod grazers more prevalent at higher latitudes. Our trait-based evidence in this study shows a contraction and almost complete shift in the functioning of marine mollusc assemblages at biogeographic transition zones and our trait database facilitates further study. Our findings provide evidence of the changing taxonomic and functional composition of extant mollusc communities with latitude, pointing to potential pertinent changes and tropicalisation of these communities with rapid ocean warming.","Floyd, M.; Mizuyama, M.; Obuchi, M.; Sommer, B.; Miller, M.G.R.; Kawamura, I.; Kise, H.; Reimer, J.D.; Beger, M.",WOS:000544831900001,"Floyd, Matthew, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01970-2,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focussed on two dominant ecosystem engineers at the Mingulay Reef Complex, the coral <i>Lophelia pertusa</i> (rubble, live and dead framework) and the sponge <i>Spongosorites coralliophaga</i>. Firstly, from combining biological (high-definition video, collected specimens), environmental (extracted from multibeam bathymetry) and ecosystem function (oxygen consumption rate values) data, we calculated biomass, C stock and turnover which can feed into assessments of C budgets. Secondly, using those values, we employed random forest modelling to predictively map whole-reef live coral and sponge biomass. The whole-reef mean biomass of <i>S. coralliophaga</i> was estimated to be 304&nbsp;T (range 168–440&nbsp;T biomass), containing 10&nbsp;T C (range 5–18&nbsp;T C) stock. The mean skeletal mass of the coral colonies (live and dead framework) was estimated to be 3874&nbsp;T (range 507–9352&nbsp;T skeletal mass), containing a mean of 209&nbsp;T of biomass (range 26–515&nbsp;T biomass) and a mean of 465&nbsp;T C (range 60–1122&nbsp;T C) stock. These estimates were used to calculate the C turnover rates, using respiration data available in the literature. These calculations revealed that the epi- and microbial fauna associated with coral rubble were the largest contributor towards C turnover in the area with a mean of 163&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> (range 149–176&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup>). The live and dead framework of <i>L. pertusa</i> were estimated to overturn a mean of 32&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> (range 4–93&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup>) and 44&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> (range 6–139&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup>), respectively. Our calculations showed that the Mingulay Reef overturned three to seven (with a mean of four) times more C than a soft-sediment area at a similar depth. As proof of concept, the supply of C needed from surface water primary productivity to the reef was inferred. Since 65–124&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> is supplied by natural deposition and our study suggested that a mean of 241&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> (range 160–400&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup>), was turned over by the reef, a mean of 117–176&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup> (range 36–335&nbsp;T C year<sup>−1</sup>) of the reef would therefore be supplied by tidal downwelling and/or deep-water advection. Our results indicate that monitoring and/or managing surface primary productivity would be a key consideration for any efforts towards the conservation of cold-water coral reef ecosystems.","De Clippele, L.H.; Rovelli, L.; Ramiro-Sánchez, B.; Kazanidis, G.; Vad, J.; Turner, S.; Glud, R.N.; Roberts, J.M.",WOS:000599052200001,"Glud, Ronnie, R.N.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-02030-5,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the capacity for foraging flexibility, our study aimed to determine the diet variability of an ectotherm omnivore inhabiting kelp forests, the sea urchin <i>Echinus esculentus</i>, along its entire latitudinal distribution in the northeast Atlantic. Using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analyses, we determined the diet and trophic position of sea urchins at sites in Portugal (42° N), France (49° N), southern Norway (63° N), and northern Norway (70° N), and related these results to the local abundance and distribution of putative food items. With mean estimated trophic levels ranging from 2.4 to 4.6, omnivory and diet varied substantially within and between sites but not across latitudes. Diet composition generally reflected prey availability within epiphyte or understorey assemblages, with local affinities demonstrating that the sea urchin adjusts its foraging to match the small-scale distribution of food items. A net “preference” for epiphytic food sources was found in northern Norway, where understorey food was limited compared to other regions. We conclude that diet change may occur in response to food source redistribution at multiple spatial scales (microhabitats, sites, regions). Across these scales, the way that key consumers alter their foraging in response to food availability can have important implication for food web dynamics and ecosystem functions along current and future environmental gradients.","Leclerc, J.-C.; De Bettignies, T.; de Bettignies, F.; Christie, H.; Franco, J.N.; Leroux, C.; Davoult, D.; Pedersen, M.F.; Filbee-Dexter, K.; Wernberg, T.",WOS:000652108500002,"Christie, Hartvig, H.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04936-5,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we evaluated whether their tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions contributes to the invasion potential of these two species. To examine the environmental tolerance and performance (e.g., growth) of these non-indigenous species, unifactorial experiments (8–10 days) were conducted with different environmental factors (solar radiation, salinity and temperature). Based on the results, the potential risk of invasion along the Chilean coast was evaluated for both species using a mechanistic niche modeling approach. Both species can tolerate extensive ranges of the abiotic factors salinity and temperature, with <i>C. intestinalis</i> being more tolerant to cold-temperate waters. Also, <i>C. intestinalis</i> was more susceptible to high light intensities than <i>C. fragile</i>. These results confirm those of other experiments, and the outcome of the niche modeling shows that both species can potentially invade most regions of the Chilean coast with the exception of the Magellan region. The results suggest that physiological capacity to tolerate and perform in a wide range of physical conditions is a pre-requisite for successful invasions by littoral biota, but predation and possibly competitive exclusion can slow down the invasion success of <i>C. intestinalis</i>, which in contrast to <i>C. fragile</i>, is consumed by many benthic predators. Sexual and asexual reproduction as well as buoyancy of its thalli further contribute to the dispersal and colonization success of <i>C. fragile</i>.

However, niche dynamics and risk predictions of marine invasions integrating phylogeographic structure in the analyses have not yet been investigated. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of two invasive lineages of Caulerpa taxifolia with different residence time in the Mediterranean Sea for a better understanding of their invasive processes. We performed lineage-based and species-based niche models to assess the risk of invasion, the spatial overlap, and the variables delimiting the distribution of the two lineages. We also compared the effect of using different extents on niche overlap and niche shift analyses. Intraspecific models with pooled occurrences accurately found two separate regions susceptible of invasion for each invasive lineage in the Mediterranean, while species-based predictions underestimated invaded regions. The invasive lineages spread across colder coastal areas than the species. Altogether, we provide evidence that different invasive lineages of algae show dissimilar environmental responses and invasive ranges that are not detectable by species-based analyses. Moreover, niche overlap and niche shift analyses seem to depend greatly on the geographical extent used. According to the most appropriate extent (worldwide), the invaded range did not show niche shift, and thus, no evidence of a post-introduction adaptation scenario was found as both lineages invaded habitats similar to their Australian native locations. Actions to prevent further spreading of the most recent invasive lineage are needed.","Chefaoui, R.M.; Varela-Álvarez, E.",WOS:000426065700013,"Chefaoui, Rosa, R.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1544-8,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two species are highly competitive and can&nbsp;occur in very high densities. Both species have been linked to the decrease of otherwise abundant native species such as the European shore crab (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>) and the common periwinkle (<i>Littorina littorea</i>). As both crabs are relatively new in European coastal waters, little is known about the full distribution range that may be achieved by these crabs and the ecological impact that may follow with an invasion of coastal habitats. In this study we investigated the potential distribution of <i>Hemigrapsus</i> in coastal waters of Northern Europe and the potential impact on the native competitor <i>C. maenas.</i> To this end we collected crabs on the Swedish west coast and on Helgoland and used these for behavioural experiments. We also collected new observation records of both species in Sweden and used these occurrences for building ecological niche models. We report that the potential distribution range of both <i>H. sanguineus</i> and <i>H. takanoi</i> extends from western Sweden to eastern Ireland (east–west) and southern Norway to western France (north–south). We also found evidence that <i>H. takanoi</i> can establish viable populations in nutrient-rich inshore areas of the western and southern Baltic Sea and that competition by <i>H. sanguineus</i> is likely to affect abundances of <i>C. maenas</i> in the areas where these species co-occur.","Karlsson, R.; Obst, M.; Berggren, M.",WOS:000483692300009,"Berggren, Matz, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02044-3,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the software package ModestR to determine the geographical distribution of all valid marine elasmobranch species (512 species of sharks and 619 species of batoids), thereby making it possible to determine the species composition of the elasmobranch community in any area worldwide. The primary aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with the species richness of elasmobranchs. The data were analyzed using multiple regressions and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in cells of 1º× 1º with the analyzed abiotic variables being bathymetry, chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically available radiation, pH, cloud cover, the concentrations of calcite, silicate, phosphate and nitrate, salinity, particulate organic carbon, diffuse attenuation and dissolved oxygen. The mean area of occupancy of the species was used as an indicator of niche occupancy. The model performed with SVM explained 97 and 99 % of the variance observed in the species richness of batoids and sharks, respectively. Mean area of occupancy, temperature and bathymetry were the variables with a higher contribution to the variance observed in both sharks and batoids. The negative residuals of the model performed with SVM indicated areas with lower than predicted species richness. These may be potential areas with undiscovered and/or unregistered species, or areas with decreased species richness due to the negative effect of anthropogenic factors, i.e. overfishing.","Guisande, C.; Patti, B.; Vaamonde, A.; Manjarrés-Hernández, A.; Pelayo-Villamil, P.; García-Roselló, E.; González-Dacosta, J.; Heine, J.; Granado-Lorencio, C.",WOS:000321628800009,"Patti, Bernardo, B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-013-0507-3,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our community modelling approach resulted in five geographically coherent ecological units that were best explained by changes in depth, temperature and salinity. Our model showed high predictive performance (AUC = 0.93) and the resulting ecological units represent more distinct species assemblages than those delineated by physiographic variables alone.

The mussel beds of the mid-intertidal coasts of the south-western Atlantic are composed of two species of scorched mussels, which dominate the physiognomy and structure of the rocky shore communities. The present study investigates the variation in the shell-shape allometric trajectories of both species of mussels throughout their distributional range in the southwestern Atlantic coast, from latitude 34°S to 53°S. Shells of <i>Brachidontes rodriguezii</i> were collected at two Uruguayan localities and four Argentinean localities, while shells of <i>Perumytilus purpuratus</i> were collected at six Argentinean localities. Shell shapes of the specimens were studied by geometric morphometrics using landmark and semi-landmark methods. Different evolutionary histories and thermal regimes characterize these two species. <i>Brachidontes rodriguezii</i> seems to have a long history in the region and is present in a restricted area, the warm temperate region of the south-western Atlantic, while <i>P. purpuratus</i> seems to have a recent history and is present in a wide thermal range, involving the cold-temperate regions of the south-western Atlantic and south-eastern Pacific and the warm-temperate region of the south-eastern Pacific. Based on these considerations, we prompt the hypothesis that allometric trajectories of <i>P. purpuratus</i> shell shape is more variable and adapted to a specific habitat than <i>B. rodriguezii</i>. The impact of allometry was larger in <i>P. purpuratus</i> than in <i>B. rodriguezii</i>. Graphical evidence was gathered, showing that these two species differ in allometric growth forms and that the allometric shell morphology changes reflect environmental constraints and adaptation. While the intertidal mussel beds of the South American coasts are ecologically similar in appearance, we found that the allometric variation of the scorched mussels occurs in response to diverging evolutionary processes such as phenotypic plasticity in <i>P. purpuratus</i> and canalization in <i>B. rodriguezii</i>.","Márquez, F.; Adami, M.L.; Trovant, B.; Nieto-Vilela, R.A.; González-José, R.",WOS:000424021400004,"Adami, Mariana, M.L.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-018-9928-5,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model projects environmental suitability using MaxEnt and considers commercial port locations, as a proxy for commercial shipping, to map patterns of relative invasion risk on a near global scale. A case study of five coastal marine crab species is presented. These models identify several regions that are at risk of new invasion where modeled environmental suitability and introduction likelihood overlap. The distribution of large commercial ports is near global but not evenly distributed; northern hemisphere temperate locations have a higher density of ports and tend to have more opportunities for invasion according to these models. This approach can be adapted to other marine and non-marine species and to current and future environmental and socioeconomic conditions, but it works best when occurrence data are representative of the complete range of conditions under which a species can survive.","Crafton, R.E.",WOS:000348186600027,"Crafton, R.

Sub-genotypes from marine and fresh waters were ecologically similar, suggesting broad ecological niches, rather than rapid evolutive adaptation to novel environments. Ecological niche models predicted that VHSv may have favorable physical (e.g., temperature, runoff), chemical (e.g., salinity, pH, phosphate), and biotic (i.e., chlorophyll) conditions for establishing into areas with important fish industries that, so far, are believed to be disease-free (i.e., freshwater and marine ecosystems of Africa, Latin America, Australia, and inland China). The model and our review suggest fish species from the Perciformes, Salmoniformes, and Gadiformes orders are likely to be infected with VHSv in novel regions as the virus expands its range to areas predicted to be at risk.

The West Indian topsnail, which inhabits rocky shores, is an important, regional fishery. It was overfished to extinction in Bermuda but reintroduced in 1982. In this study, we estimate potential population size through habitat mapping using high-resolution imagery and ground-based survey data. We also test the effects of image resolution and map scale on intertidal habitat assessments. The coastline of Bermuda was mapped as a linear feature (1:500) using high-resolution imagery. Topsnail population size was predicted using length of preferred habitat and population density. With the comprehensive map as ground-truth, effects of scale were assessed in two ways: supervised classification of low-resolution imagery and progressive map scale coarsening (Douglas-Peuker simplification). Bermuda’s coastline is 296 km at this map scale, 50 % of which is rocky shore. Topsnail population could expand significantly if all preferred habitat is occupied. However, image resolution and map scale drastically affect mapping robustness. Unsurprisingly, automated classifiers poorly distinguished narrow intertidal habitats. More disturbingly, coarsening map scale differentially affected habitats. Fine-scale mapping enabled by high-resolution imagery is vital for intertidal conservation planning. Limitations of low-resolution imagery and scale-dependent biases are pertinent beyond intertidal habitats. Numerous predominantly linear habitats may be especially sensitive to sea-level rise and other effects of climate change, so careful consideration of the effects of scale on habitat assessments and the use of high-resolution imagery are strongly recommended.","Meyer, E.L.; Matzke, N.J.; Williams, S.J.",WOS:000356537700001,"Meyer, Erin, E.L.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-014-0371-7,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combination of different metacommunity models contributed to the structure of the benthic species, suggesting that the interplay of environmental and spatial factors played a key role in determining the beach community structure. Our study highlights the sensitivity of beach invertebrates to environmental factors such as morphodynamic descriptors, and to oceanographic-related variables (e.g., sea-water temperature). The results also suggest significant spatial signals at a large geographical scale. We applied two different species categorizations, high dispersive vs low dispersive and generalist vs specialist, to disentangle the roles of dispersal mode and habitat specialization in the beach metacommunity structure. The strength of the environmental and spatial factors varied depending on the category of species traits considered, emphasizing the value of using different groups of species in explaining variation in metacommunity dynamics. Low dispersive species showed a better ability to track environmental variability than high dispersive species, which were more spatially constrained. Habitat specialists were better able to track environmental variability than generalists, which were mainly predicted by pure spatial factors. A better understanding of the metacommunity dynamics using different species categorizations can help to improve our predictions about exposed beach community structure, and to prioritize management actions to cope with biodiversity loss in such superlative marine environment.","Rodil, I.F.; Lucena-Moya, P.; Lastra, M.",WOS:000418591000016,"Rodil, Ivan, I.F.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-017-0263-9,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterizing patterns of flyingfish abundance, distribution, and habitat preference has important implications for understanding both localized and generalized functions of marine ecosystems. The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) supports many flyingfish species and their predators, yet no studies to date have identified oceanographic factors that define flyingfish habitats or estimate species richness and diversity at broad taxonomic and geographic scales. In this study, we analyzed 11,125 flyingfish representing 25 species and all seven named genera, collected from the ETP over a 21-year period. We applied spatially explicit analysis methods (ARCGIS, DIVA-GIS, MAXENT) and compared specimen locality data to remotely sensed oceanographic data and previously described oceanographic partitions. Our results show that <i>Exocoetus</i> is the most abundant genus (49%) and <i>E. monocirrhus</i> the most abundant species (32%) of flyingfishes in the ETP. Mean sea surface temperature was most important for defining flyingfish habitats (19.2–41.7%) and species richness (highest in the North Equatorial Current). Additionally, flyingfish species diversity was found to be highest in coastal regions of the study area (Shannon indices &gt; 1.5).

Here, we analyzed the LDG pattern in gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) in the Tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean (TEP), where they form a widespread, species-rich, and ecologically important group of marine benthic organisms. We compiled a database of the geographic occurrence of shallow-water (< 40 m depth) gorgonians with a range extent restricted to the TEP, in order to evaluate the shape of their LDG and to test different hypotheses that could explain these patterns (Rapoport’s and mid-domain effects), as well as the possible underlying mechanisms (source-sink dynamics and climatic variability hypothesis). The species richness showed a peak at 7–10° N with > 60 spp., declining toward the north and south. The gorgonians exhibit an increase of their distribution ranges at higher latitudes, supporting predictions of Rapoport’s effect, an effect rarely found in TEP marine faunas. This pattern is likely the result of a decrease of gorgonian temperature tolerances at lower latitudes. We highlight the existence of at least four gorgonian assemblages within the TEP exhibiting distinctive temperature adaptations, and a strong change in species composition with latitude. Our results indicate that sea temperature is an important factor shaping the distribution of gorgonians in the TEP, as in several other marine taxa.","Núñez–Flores, M.; Solórzano, A.; Hernández, C.E.; López-González, P.J.",WOS:000501242900022,"Núñez–Flores, Mónica, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12526-019-01006-1,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For marine fish, marine protected areas (MPAs) often harbour more individuals, especially of species targeted by fisheries. But precise pathways of biodiversity change remain unclear. For example, how local-scale responses combine to affect regional biodiversity, important for managing spatial networks of MPAs, is not well known. Protection potentially influences three components of fish assemblages that determine how species accumulate with sampling effort and spatial scale: the total number of individuals, the relative abundance of species and within-species aggregation. Here, we examined the contributions of each component to species richness changes inside MPAs as a function of spatial scale.</li>                                                   <li>Using standardized underwater visual survey data, we measured the abundance and species richness of reef fishes in 43 protected and 41 fished sites in the Mediterranean Sea.</li>                                                   <li>At both local and regional scales, increased species evenness caused by added common species in MPAs compared to fished sites was the most important proximate driver of higher diversity.</li>                                                   <li>Site-to-site variation in the composition (i.e. <i>β</i>-diversity) of common species was also higher among protected sites, and depended on sensitivity to exploitation.

In contrast, fewer abundant unexploited species were found at the regional scale than at the local scale, meaning that relative abundances at the regional scale were less even than at the local scale.</li>                                                   <li><i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are known to strongly influence fish community abundance and biomass, we found that changes to the relative abundance of species (i.e. increased evenness) dominated the biodiversity response to protection. MPAs had more relatively common species, which in turn led to higher diversity for a given sampling effort. Moreover, higher <i>β</i>-diversity of common species meant that local-scale responses were magnified at the regional scale due to site-to-site variation inside protected areas for exploited species.

Recent research suggests that shelf sediments might have a role to play as a natural climate solution, e.g. by storing organic carbon if left undisturbed from anthropogenic activity. However, we have an incomplete understanding about the centres of organic carbon accumulation and storage on continental shelves. To better constrain the rate of accumulation and the mass of organic carbon that is stored in sediments, we developed and applied a spatial modelling framework that allows us to estimate those quantities from sparse observations and predictor variables known or suspected to influence the spatial patterns of these parameters. This paper presents spatial distribution patterns of organic carbon densities and accumulation rates in the North Sea and Skagerrak. We found that organic carbon stocks and accumulation rates are highest in the Norwegian Trough, while large parts of the North Sea are characterised by low stocks and zero net accumulation. The total stock of organic carbon that is stored in the upper 0.1 m of sediments amounted to 230.5 ± 134.5 Tg C, of which approximately 26 % is stored in the Norwegian Trough. Rates of organic carbon accumulation in the Norwegian Trough are comparable with those reported from nearby fjords. We provide baseline datasets that could be used in marine management, e.g. for the establishment of “carbon protection zones”.

Experiments are better suited at attributing causation, but they are often limited in scope. We propose hybrid datasets, resulting from the integration of observational with experimental data, as an approach to leverage the scope and ability to attribute causality in ecological studies. We show how the analysis of hybrid datasets with emerging techniques in time series analysis (Convergent Cross-mapping) and macroecology (Joint Species Distribution Models) can generate novel insights into causal effects of abiotic and biotic processes that would be difficult to achieve otherwise. We illustrate these principles with two case studies in marine ecosystems and discuss the potential to generalize across environments, species and ecological processes.

Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta-analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85° of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea-surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4-fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2-fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.","Cheng, B.S.; Altieri, A.H.; Torchin, M.E.; Ruiz, G.M.",WOS:000462934100016,"Ruiz, Gregory, G.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2617,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Species distribution models provide one way to identify potentially suitable habitat by developing the relationship between climate variables and species occurrence data. However, these models when applied to freshwater invasions are complicated by two factors. The first is that the range expansions that typically occur as part of the invasion process violate standard species distribution model assumptions of data stationarity. Second, predicting potential range of freshwater aquatic species is complicated by the reliance on terrestrial climate measurements to develop occurrence relationships for species that occur in aquatic environments. To overcome these obstacles, we combined a recently developed algorithm for species distribution modeling—range bagging—with newly available aquatic habitat-specific information from the North American Great Lakes region to predict suitable habitat for three potential invasive species: golden mussel, killer shrimp, and northern snakehead. Range bagging may more accurately predict relative suitability than other methods because it focuses on the limits of the species environmental tolerances rather than central tendency or “typical” cases. Overlaying the species distribution model output with aquatic habitat-specific data then allowed for more specific predictions of areas with high suitability. Our results indicate there is suitable habitat for northern snakehead in the Great Lakes, particularly shallow coastal habitats in the lower four Great Lakes where literature suggests they will favor areas of wetland and submerged aquatic vegetation. These coastal areas also offer the highest suitability for golden mussel, but our models suggest they are marginal habitats. Globally, the Great Lakes provide the closest match to the currently invaded range of killer shrimp, but they appear to pose an intermediate risk to the region. Range bagging provided reliable predictions when assessed either by a standard test set or by tests for spatial transferability, with golden mussel being the most difficult to accurately predict. Our approach illustrates the strength of combining multiple sources of data, while reiterating the need for increased measurement of freshwater habitat at high spatial resolutions to improve the ability to predict potential invasive species.","Kramer, A.M.; Annis, G.; Wittmann, M.E.; Chadderton, W.L.; Rutherford, E.S.; Lodge, D.M.; Mason, L.; Beletsky, D.; Riseng, C.; Drake, J.M.",WOS:000406332400014,"Kramer, Andrew, A.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1883,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased—areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems.

The distributional boundaries, mainly driven by temperature and irradiance, suggest the existence of environmental suitability in warm temperate areas, as well as in the Northern Hemisphere off Atlantic and Asian coasts. These theoretical edges and respective environmental drivers agree with the physiological affinities of both species, supporting the hypothesis that these variables act as limiting factors for their occurrences in tropical or warmer areas.

Marine natural capital provides the flow of “marine ecosystem services” that are directly used or enjoyed by people providing benefits to human well-being. They include provisioning services (e.g., food), regulation and maintenance services (e.g., carbon sequestration and storage, and coastal protection), and cultural services (e.g., tourism and recreational benefits). In recent decades, human activities have increased the pressures on marine ecosystems, often leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, in turn, affecting their ability to provide benefits to humans. Therefore, effective management strategies are crucial to the conservation of healthy and diverse marine ecosystems and to ensuring their long-term generation of goods and services. Biophysical, economic, and sociocultural assessments of marine ecosystem services are much needed to convey the importance of natural resources to managers and policy makers supporting the development and implementation of policies oriented for the sustainable management of marine resources. In addition, the accounting of marine ecosystem service values can be usefully complemented by their mapping to enable the identification of priority areas and management strategies and to facilitate science–policy dialogue. Given this premise, this study aims to review trends and evolution in the concept of marine ecosystem services. In particular, the global scientific literature on marine ecosystem services is explored by focusing on the following main aspects: the definition and classification of marine ecosystem services; their loss due to anthropogenic pressures, alternative assessment, and mapping approaches; and the inclusion of marine ecosystem services into policy and decision-making processes.","Buonocore, E.; Grande, U.; Franzese, P.P.; Russo, G.F.",WOS:000682177900001,"Buonocore, Elvira, E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13152060,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,marine ecosystems; ecosystem services; benefits to humans; biophysical assessment; economic valuation,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, such systems may provide an alternative to the classical theory of stable evolutionary coexistence of generalist and specialist species on a single resource dimension. We explore such systems and the potential trade-offs between different resource dimensions in clownfishes.

We find a negative correlation between host range and environmental specificities in temperature, salinity and pH, probably indicating a trade-off between both types of specialization forcing species to specialize only in a single direction.

This provides an opportunity to study the differences in temperature sensitivity between two sibling species of the cosmopolitian foraminifera <i>Amphistegina</i>. Both species are very common in the Red Sea. Whilest, only one is a successful invader and the other is absent in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here we show that the two species are different in their temperature sensitivity, which explains their selective invasion into the Mediterranean. These differences demonstrate that in respect to climate change resilient marine species can be distinguished by their ability to compensate for temperature changes by adjusting their physiological performance and by having tolerance to a wider temperature range.

Ocean warming may cause shifts in coral communities by increasing temperatures above coral’s upper thermal limits in tropical regions, and by making extratropical regions (marginal reefs) more suitable and potential refugia. We used Bayesian models to project coral occurrence, cover and bleaching probabilities in Southwestern Atlantic and predicted how these probabilities will change under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). By overlapping these projections, we categorized areas that combine high probabilities of coral occurrence, cover and bleaching as vulnerability-hotspots. Current coral occurrence and cover probabilities were higher in the tropics (1°S–20°S) but both will decrease and shift to new suitable extratropical reefs (20°S–27°S; tropicalization) with ocean warming. Over 90% of the area present low and mild vulnerability, while the vulnerability-hotspots represent ~ 3% under current and future scenarios, but include the most biodiverse reef complex in South Atlantic (13°S–18°S; Abrolhos Bank).

However, the distribution of the franciscana is not continuous along its range, with two hiatuses proposed in southeastern Brazilian coast. The absence of franciscana records in these regions has been confirmed by multiple years of research, however the reasons for this discontinuous distribution is not well understood. In this study, information on the distribution of the franciscana in south and southeastern Brazil is updated and new limits for FMAs are proposed. NicheA 3.0 software was used to investigate the environmental suitability of distributional gaps in relation to four weakly correlated, allegedly relevant descriptors of franciscana's distribution. In total, 788 records from dedicated aerial and boat surveys and bycatch were used to verify and to confirm the new FMAs limits proposed by franciscana's experts previously. The distributional gaps were reshaped and defined as following: Gap I from Piraquê-Açu River Mouth, Santa Cruz (19°57′S) in the state of Espírito Santo to Barra de Itabapoana (21°18′S) in the state of Rio de Janeiro; and Gap II from Armação dos Búzios (22°44′S) to Piraquara de Dentro (22°59′S) in Rio de Janeiro. The ecological niche model indicated that distributional gaps are inside franciscana's fundamental niche, and are relatively suitable in terms of salinity, temperature, diffuse attenuation and bathymetry. However, the narrow of continental shelf seems to be the main factor explaining the absence of franciscanas in the distributional gaps as well as for the differentiation of some of the FMAs proposed. Narrowness of continental shelf seems to be intensifying the dynamics of biotic interactions promoting food competition for example, and/or causing geographic limitation to maintain minimal viable population size in present or past times periods.","do Amaral, K.B.; Danilewicz, D.; Zerbini, A.; Di Beneditto, A.P.; Andriolo, A.; Alvares, D.J.; Secchi, E.; Ferreira, E.; Sucunza, F.; Borges-Martins, M.; de Oliveira Santos, M.C.; Cremer, M.; Denuncio, P.; Ott, P.H.; Moreno, I.B.",WOS:000446287900001,"do Amaral, Karina, K.B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.07.010,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Pontoporia blainvillei,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum likelihood (MaxLike) species distribution modelling to test three hypotheses: the distribution of basking sharks is determined by (1) temperature, (2) chlorophyll concentration, or (3) both chlorophyll and temperature, while considering other factors, such as oxygen and salinity. Off South America, basking shark habitat included subtropical, temperate and cool-temperate waters between approximately 20°S and 55°S. Off Africa, basking shark habitat was limited to cool-temperate waters off Namibia and southern South Africa. MaxLike models had a better fit than MaxEnt models. The best model included minimum chlorophyll concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, and sea surface temperature range, supporting hypothesis 3. However, of all variables included in the best model, minimum chlorophyll concentration had the highest influence on basking shark distribution. Unlike the North Atlantic distribution, the South Atlantic distribution of basking sharks includes subtropical and cool-temperate waters. This difference is explained by high minimum chlorophyll concentration off southern Brazil as compared to North Atlantic subtropical areas. Observations in other regions of the world support this conclusion.

Because collecting specimens and data from the deep ocean is expensive and logistically difficult, it would be useful to be able to predict where species of interest are likely to occur so that sampling effort can be concentrated in appropriate areas. The distribution of two representative midwater fishes, the gulper eel <em>Eurypharynx pelecanoides</em> and the bobtail eel <em>Cyema atrum</em> (Teleostei: Saccopharyngiformes), were modeled with MaxEnt software to examine the viability of species distribution modeling (SDM) for globally distributed midwater fishes using currently available environmental data from the ocean surface and bottom. These species were chosen because they are relatively abundant, easily recognized, and unlikely to have been misidentified in database records, and are true midwater fishes, not known to undertake significant vertical diurnal migration. Models for both species show a generally worldwide distribution with some exceptions, including the Southern Ocean and Bering Sea.

The mechanisms by which temperature influences fish size at maturation are not well understood, particularly in natural populations, but may have broad implications if climate change continues to warm the seas. In this study, we use populations of 16 fish species across the Mediterranean Sea to evaluate the association between different temperature metrics and fish size at maturation, and to understand the variation among species. We found that both mean annual temperature and growing degree days (GDD) were the best supported environmental predictors of fish size at maturation. This suggests that the mechanisms affecting size at maturation may differ from those affecting maximum size, for which maximum temperature was the best predictor. Across species, we found that the effect of temperature is stronger for more active species, while other species-level predictors had limited influence.

By comparing SDM performance for the whole species or where observation and predictions were partitioned among geographically discontinuous genetic lineages, we first identified the appropriate biological unit for modeling sea scallop. Prediction errors, in particular contiguous omissions at the northern range margins were effectively halved in genetic lineage SDM (Total error=15%) verses whole species SDM. Remaining SDM prediction error was strongly associated with: i) Sharp climatic gradients (abrupt and persistent spatial shifts in limiting temperatures) found within continental shelf breaks and bottom channels. ii) A biotic gradient in the predation of sea scallop juveniles by the sand star within the Hudson Shelf USA.

We obtained location information from primary and secondary sources, and used environmental predictors related to species survival, growth and reproduction spanning terrestrial and marine realms. Explanatory environmental variables broadly corresponded between scales, with maximum sea surface salinity and tidal range being common factors across species differing in their dispersal potential and habitat specificity. The Indian coastline exhibits a steep salinity and tidal range gradient, which may influence adult or larval survival through desiccation stress.

One explanation for the enormous disparity in <em>Conus</em> diversity is that the amount of available habitat may differ, or may have differed in the past due to eustatic (global) sea level changes. Historical bathymetric data, however, indicated that sea level fluctuations since the Miocene have had a similar impact on the available habitat area in both Cape Verde and Canary archipelagos and therefore do not explain this disparity. We suggest that recurrent gene flow between the Canary Islands and West Africa, habitat losses due to intense volcanic activity in combination with unsuccessful colonization of new <em>Conus</em> species from more diverse regions, were all determinant in shaping diversity patterns within the Canarian archipelago. Worldwide <em>Conus</em> species diversity follows the well-established pattern of latitudinal increase of species richness from the poles towards the tropics. However, the eastern Atlantic revealed a striking pattern with two main peaks of <em>Conus</em> species richness in the subtropical area and decreasing diversities toward the tropical western African coast. A Random Forests model using 12 oceanographic variables suggested that sea surface temperature is the main determinant of <em>Conus</em> diversity either at continental scales (eastern Atlantic coast) or in a broader context (worldwide). Other factors such as availability of suitable habitat and reduced salinity due to the influx of large rivers in the tropical area also play an important role in shaping <em>Conus</em> diversity patterns in the western coast of Africa.","Cunha, R.L.; Lima, F.P.; Tenorio, M.J.; Ramos, A.A.; Castilho, R.; Williams, S.T.",WOS:000344695900008,"Williams, Suzanne, S.T.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syu059,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Conus,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those functions are compromised by mounting pressures on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Because of its economic and food value, fish biomass production provides an unusually direct link from biodiversity to critical ecosystem services. We used the Reef Life Survey’s global database of 4,556 standardized fish surveys to test the importance of biodiversity to fish production relative to 25 environmental drivers. Temperature, biodiversity, and human influence together explained 47% of the global variation in reef fish biomass among sites. Fish species richness and functional diversity were among the strongest predictors of fish biomass, particularly for the large-bodied species and carnivores preferred by fishers, and these biodiversity effects were robust to potentially confounding influences of sample abundance, scale, and environmental correlations. Warmer temperatures increased biomass directly, presumably by raising metabolism, and indirectly by increasing diversity, whereas temperature variability reduced biomass. Importantly, diversity and climate interact, with biomass of diverse communities less affected by rising and variable temperatures than species-poor communities. Biodiversity thus buffers global fish biomass from climate change, and conservation of marine biodiversity can stabilize fish production in a changing ocean.","Duffy, J.E.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Navarrete, S.A.; Edgar, G.J.",WOS:000376784600048,"Edgar, Graham, G.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1524465113,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,global change; fisheries; functional diversity; macroecology; structural equation model,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, rates of consumption peaked at midlatitudes (25 to 35°) in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres across both seagrass and unvegetated sediment habitats. This pattern contrasts with terrestrial systems, where biotic interactions reportedly weaken away from the equator, but it parallels an emerging pattern of a subtropical peak in marine biodiversity. The higher consumption at midlatitudes was closely related to the type of consumers present, which explained rates of consumption better than consumer density, biomass, species diversity, or habitat.

However, considering the competitive exclusion principle, PNC is questionable for related species in sympatry. This research aimed to test PNC in Riorajini, a tribe of four skates endemic to the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: <i>Atlantoraja castelnaui</i>, <i>A. cyclophora</i>, <i>A. platana</i>, and <i>Rioraja agassizii</i>. We updated available distribution maps for these species with literature data, reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the group with genetic data (<i>mt-nd2</i>), modelled the ecological niche (ENM) of each species, and calculated niche overlap, equivalency and similarity between models. The results recovered Riorajini as a monophyletic group and indicated PNC with bathymetry, distance to shore and concentration of nitrate characterizing the tribe's abiotic niche. However, no linear relationship between phylogenetic proximity and niche similarity was clear since pairs of species more phylogenetically distant showed more similar niches (<i>R. agassizii</i> and <i>A. castelnaui</i>, &gt; 70% niche similarity, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.005) than congeners (<i>A. castelnaui</i> and <i>A. platana</i>, 45%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.005). ENMs of each species showed different responses to variations in environmental predictors, with <i>A. castelnaui</i> and <i>R. agassizii</i> showing higher probability of occurrence in shallower waters, closer to shore, while <i>A. cyclophora</i> and <i>A. platana</i> explore deeper areas, although still constrained to the continental shelf. We discuss how these differences influence the distribution of each species in the environment and used the phylogeny to argue that <i>R. agassizii</i> and <i>A. castelnaui</i> share a conserved niche from an ancestral lineage.","Coelho, J.F.R.; Lima, S.M.Q.; Petean, F.F.",WOS:000592303900001,"Coelho, Jéssica, J.F.R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17451000.2020.1837883,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Coexistence; ecological niche model; Grinnellian niche; Neotropical coastal zone; threatened species,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, substantial species occurrence data are readily available for large parts of the world and are accessible programmatically. Considering both the observed and expected changes in species distributions, and hence biodiversity, in response to present and future climate change, it is important to utilise readily available species occurrence databases to generate temporal and spatial biodiversity maps. In this study biodiversity maps were generated for three generic functional groups within the exclusive economic zone of South Africa: zooplankton, fishes and benthos. This was achieved by stacking individual species-distribution maps. Freely available occurrence data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) were accessed for this purpose. Ensemble species-distribution modelling, employing five widely used statistical methods, was used to generate species-distribution maps for each functional group. The resulting spatial patterns of biodiversity for the three functional groups were largely in agreement with known patterns.

Fifteen islands and 145 sites across 15º of latitude and 2850 km were sampled. We found high spatial variability across the scales considered (archipelago, island and site). The structure of macroalgal communities differed among archipelagos, except between Madeira and the Canaries, which were similar. Across a latitudinal gradient, macroalgal communities in the Azores were clearly separated from the other archipelagos; communities in Madeira and the Canaries occupied an intermediate position, while those in Cape Verde appeared at the opposite end of the gradient. In the Azores, species with warm-temperate affinities dominated communities. Cape Verde communities were, in contrast, dominated by tropical taxa, whereas in the subtropical Canaries and Madeira there was a mixture of species with colder and warmer affinities. Apart from crustose coralline algae, the Dictyotales were the group with greatest cover; larger and longer-lived species were progressively replaced by short-lived species along a latitudinal gradient from north to south. The perennial species <i>Zonaria tournefortii</i> dominated the sea-bottom in the Azores, the semi-perennial <i>Lophophora variegata</i> in the Canaries, the filamentous algae in Madeira and the ephemeral <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i> in Cape Verde. We hypothesized that the differences among archipelagos could be explained by synergies between temperature and herbivory, which increased in diversity southwards, especially in Cape Verde. This was supported by the predominance of non-crustose macroalgae in the Azores and of crustose macroalgae in Cape Verde, as would be predicted from the greater herbivore activity.

Long-term trends in water quality, land cover, and pesticide use in watersheds of the Southern Great Plains and their association with <i>Prymnesium parvum</i>. MSc Thesis. Texas Tech University: Lubbock. 105 pp.","Prymnesium parvum is a harmful alga responsible for numerous fish-kill events worldwide and in the United States. Different biotic and abiotic factors may influence P. parvum distribution, growth, and toxicity. Several studies have been conducted on the association of water quality, lake inflow, and some biotic variables with P. parvum presence and bloom formation; however, the combination of water quality, weather and climate, hydrologic, land cover, and pesticide variables has not been applied before. In Texas, two of the most impacted river basins since 2001 are the Colorado River and Brazos River basins. This study examined one reservoir impacted by P. parvum and one unimpacted (reference) reservoir from each of these basins to address the following objectives at the watershed-scale: 1) compare and contrast environmental conditions in impacted reservoirs in the periods before and after the onset of toxic blooms in 2001, 2) determine environmental conditions that are unique to impacted reservoirs in the two study basins, and 3) identify potential environmental drivers of toxic blooms. The temporal scale of the variables was annual (average or cumulative as appropriate). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to address objectives 1 and 2. The period of record (POR) for objective 1 was 1992-2017 and only data from P. parvum-impacted reservoirs were used. Results showed that the use of most pesticides generally declined since 2001, coincidentally with the onset of toxic blooms, while the use of the herbicide Glyphosate and atmospheric CO2 concentration increased. The POR for objective 2 was limited to 2001-2017 and data from all four reservoirs were included. Results showed that P. parvum-impacted reservoirs have higher specific conductance, lower percent wetland area, and lower use of certain pesticides. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to address objective 3. All reservoirs were included in this analysis, the POR was 1992-2017, the dependent variable was toxic bloom occurrence (YES or NO at annual scale), and independent variables included non-redundant variables selected from a correlation matrix. Salinity (specific conductance) was the primary split, where the risk of toxic bloom increased greatly at levels ≥ 1613 µS/cm. The second split was the insecticide Terbufos, where the risk of toxic bloom increased at relatively low use levels when combined with high salinity. To avoid collinearity, percent wetland area was not included in the original CART model because it was highly correlated with salinity, but a new model was rebuilt replacing salinity with percent wetland area. The first split was percent wetland area, where the risk of toxic bloom increased with values below ≤ 0.43%. Overall, these results suggest that 1) the reduced use of potentially growth inhibitory pesticides and the increased use of Glyphosate – a known stimulant of P. parvum growth – coupled with the rising levels of air CO2 – also a known stimulant of growth – may have contributed to the onset of toxic blooms in the early 2000s; and 2) high levels of salinity, lower percentages of wetland area, and lower use of certain pesticides are unique traits of P. parvum-impacted reservoirs and are also associated with increased risk of toxic blooms.","Tábora Sarmiento, S.D.",,"Tábora Sarmiento, Shisbeth Danyra, S.D.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Prymnesium parvum,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is located in the Northeast of Brazil, more precisely inside the APA of Manguezal da Barra Grande, in Icapuí, State of Ceará. The stopover site has a great biodiversity of mollusks and crustaceans, important for the diet of these birds, and for the local shellfishing activity practiced mainly by women. In fact, in coastal areas of Ceará, the main economic activity is usually artisanal fishing and the environments explored are also often occupied by birds. Thus, local communities become key stakeholders in proposals for the conservation of fauna and ecosystems. For this study 19 shellfish collectors from Icapuí were interviewed about their ecological knowledge on migratory shorebirds, through semi-structured questionnaires, in June 2021.

While the country is considered as a home to a wide range of flora and fauna, much of its biological assets has not yet been apprehended. Rotifers, the members of phylum Rotifera, comprise some 2000 species of minute aquatic invertebrates. They have increasingly attracted efforts from the global taxonomists and limnologists not only due to their crucial role in aquatic food webs, but also for their growing applications in fundamental biological research and aquaculture industry. The oldest available records of Iranian rotifers date back to almost 70 years ago. Notwithstanding that the task to discover the aquatic invertebrates, such as rotifers, of all Iranian waters is far from complete, the last decade has witnessed an expanding quantity of research and publications on their diversity. In this chapter, a review of the surveys on phylum Rotifera in Iran has been provided, including a checklist of the identified rotifer taxa, based on almost all available data.

We found that downscaled SDMs had higher predictive accuracy than reference SDMs. Transferred and upscaled models had lower predictive accuracy than their reference counterparts but still performed better than random, making them potentially acceptable alternatives where information is lacking for imminent decisions or in cost-restricted scenarios. Our results provide insights into the techniques available for researchers and managers developing SDMs at varying scales, with different species, and with different levels of initial information.","Eger, A.M.; Curtis, J.M.R.; Fortin, M.-J.; Côté, I.M.; Guichard, F.",WOS:000400011100012,"Côté, Isabelle, I.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0129,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies show how genetic data can inform spatial conservation prioritization (SCP), but they focus on metrics of diversity and distinctness derived primarily from neutral genetic data sets. Identifying adaptive genetic markers can provide important information regarding the capacity for populations to adapt to environmental change. Yet, the effect of including metrics based on adaptive genomic data into SCP in comparison to more widely used neutral genetic metrics has not been explored. We used existing genomic data on a commercially exploited species, the giant California sea cucumber (<i>Parastichopus californicus</i>), to perform SCP for the coastal region of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using a RAD-seq data set for 717 <i>P. californicus</i> individuals across 24 sampling locations, we identified putatively adaptive (i.e., candidate) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on genotype–environment associations with seafloor temperature. We calculated various metrics for both neutral and candidate SNPs and compared SCP outcomes with independent metrics and combinations of metrics. Priority areas varied depending on whether neutral or candidate SNPs were used and on the specific metric used. For example, targeting sites with a high frequency of warm-temperature-associated alleles to support persistence under future warming prioritized areas in the southern coastal region. In contrast, targeting sites with high expected heterozygosity at candidate loci to support persistence under future environmental uncertainty prioritized areas in the north. When combining metrics, all scenarios generated intermediate solutions, protecting sites that span latitudinal and thermal gradients. Our results demonstrate that distinguishing between neutral and adaptive markers can affect conservation solutions and emphasize the importance of defining objectives when choosing among various genomic metrics for SCP.","Xuereb, A.; D'Aloia, C.C.; Andrello, M.; Bernatchez, L.; Fortin, M.-J.",WOS:000577896200001,"Fortin, Marie-Josée, M.-J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13609,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an extension of the Glacial Atlantic Ocean Mapping (GLAMAP) reconstruction of the Atlantic NSST based on the faunal and floral assemblage data of the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean Surface (MARGO) project and several recent estimates of the LGM sea-ice extent. Such a gridded climatology is highly useful for the visualization of the LGM climate, calculation of global and regional NSST averages, and estimation of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, as well as a boundary condition for atmospheric general circulation models. The gridding of the sparse NSST reconstruction was done in an optimal way using the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) software, which takes into account the uncertainty in the reconstruction and includes the calculation of an error field. The resulting Glacial Ocean Map (GLOMAP) confirms the previous findings by the MARGO project regarding longitudinal and meridional NSST differences that were greater than today in all oceans. Taken at face value, the estimated global and tropical cooling would imply an equilibrium climate sensitivity at the lower end of the currently accepted range. However, because of anticipated changes in the seasonality and thermal structure of the upper ocean during the LGM as well as uneven spatial sampling, the estimated cooling and implied climate sensitivity are likely to be biased towards lower values.","Paul, A.; Mulitza, S.; Stein, R.; Werner, M.",WOS:000639001100001,"Paul, André, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-805-2021,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the natural habitats of sandy shores are being modified at rates never experienced before, making beaches key monitoring sites of marine ecosystems worldwide. The ghost crab species <i>Ocypode quadrata</i> is the most conspicuous crustacean of sandy beaches along the Western Atlantic coast and has been successfully used as an indicator of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental variability. To investigate the potential role of a “triple whammy” [(1) urbanization; (2) use of resources; (3) decreasing resilience] on the most common bioindicator of sandy shores, we compiled a dataset including 214 records of burrows density from 94 microtidal sandy beach sectors covering a range of over 65° of latitude. The response of burrows density to synergetic effects of human modification of natural systems and environmental changes was investigated using linear models. We used the cumulative Human Modification (HMc) index, a standardized geographic projection of changes of natural systems, as a predictor of urbanization, industrialization and use of resources. The predictor wave energy, tidal range and temperature (sea surface and air) were included as potential effects of climate changes. Literature review showed records mainly concentrated at sub-tropical and temperate regions. HMc values were clearly negatively related to burrows density, thereby supporting an effect of modification of natural habitat at large spatial scale. Sea surface temperature and air temperature were positive related with density and the lack of a general pattern of the relationship between burrows density, interactions between wave energy and tide range, supported unclear patterns reported at regional scales. Finally, we argue that ghost crabs are valuable targets for protection actions on sandy beaches that can benefit coexisting species and provide natural habitat conservation.","Barboza, C.A.M.; Mattos, G.; Soares-Gomes, A.; Zalmon, I.R.; Costa, L.L.",WOS:000632501300001,"Soares-Gomes, Abílio, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.589542,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Ocypode quadrata,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are collected with handheld thermometers or underwater temperature recorders (UTRs) and are recorded at precisions from 0.5° to 0.001°C. Using the natural range of seasonal signals and variability for 84 of these time series, their length, decadal trend, and data precision were systematically varied before fitting generalized least squares (GLS) models to study the effect these variables have on trend detection. The variables that contributed most to accurate trend detection, in decreasing order, were time series length, decadal trend, variance, percentage of missing data (% NA), and measurement precision. Time series greater than 30 years in length are preferred and although larger decadal trends are modeled more accurately, modeled significance (p value) is largely affected by the variance present. The risk of committing both type-1 and type-2 errors increases when ≥5% NA is present. There is no appreciable effect on model accuracy between measurement precision of 0.1°–0.001°C. Measurement precisions of 0.5°C require longer time series to give equally accurate model results. The implication is that the thermometer time series in this dataset, and others around the world, must be at least two years longer than their UTR counterparts to be useful for decadal-scale climate change studies. Furthermore, adding older lower-precision UTR data to newer higher-precision UTR data within the same time series will increase their usefulness for this purpose.","Schlegel, R.W.; Smit, A.J.",WOS:000391854800005,"Smit, Albertus, A.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-16-0014.1,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an analysis of the historical introductions and establishments of marine and estuarine ornamental species in California using a database (‘NEMESIS’) and the contemporary fluxes (quantities, taxa) based on government records, direct observations of aquarium-bound shipments, and internet commerce. California is the major port of entry of marine ornamental species in the United States, which is the major global importing country. The vector was considered possibly responsible for twelve species between 1853–2011, nine of which successfully established, including <i>Caulerpa taxifolia</i> (Mediterranean invasive strain). The flux of imported ornamental species was over 11 million individual animals in 2009 and included 37 taxa from at least six temperate countries, although the majority originated from the Indo-Pacific region. Almost 4,000 individuals representing at least 149 species were imported into San Francisco on a single day in 2012. Estimates of imported quantities were probably accurate within an order of magnitude but could be improved with data on interstate shipments and internet commerce. Importations of high concern included <i>P. volitans</i>, live rock, <i>Chromis viridis</i> (green chromis), <i>Cromileptes altivelis</i> (panther or humpback grouper). The low historical establishment rate for ornamental species hypothetically could be explained part by a low release rate or temperature mismatch, but the flux remains high and is a growing concern that could be addressed by heightened public education.","Williams, S.; Crafton, E.; Fontana, R.; Grosholz, E.; Ha, G.; Pasari, J.; Zabin, C.",WOS:000422634100002,"Williams, Susan, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2015.6.1.02,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,"invasive, marine, ornamental, aquarium, internet commerce, vector",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is also a source and sink of invasive alien species (IAS), with some listed among the worst 100 invasive species by the IUCN. A common approach to study biodiversity and biogeographic patterns or to predict the invasive potential of species is the application of ecological niche models and species distribution models. These are statistical methods using spatially gridded environmental data and species occurrence information. As the Caspian Sea is not connected to the world’s oceans, spatially gridded environmental data for the Caspian Sea are not available in the widely used Bio-ORACLE marine data set. To address this issue, we compiled 28 ecologically relevant spatially gridded environmental variables using Kriging interpolation of point data to model minimum, maximum, mean, and range of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen for the surface and benthic zones of the Caspian Sea. Data were retrieved from the World Ocean Database. Additionally, we utilized raster statistics to create surface layers of maximum, mean, minimum, and range of chlorophyll a from remotely sensed data. We developed these environmental variables as they were previously confirmed to be relevant for the biogeographical classification of the Caspian Sea. To allow projections of models across the world’s oceans into the Caspian Sea (and vice versa), we matched our raster dimensions with those of the Bio-ORACLE data set. Our extension of the Bio-ORACLE data set with data from the Caspian Sea provides an important basis for the monitoring and evaluation of suitable habitats for native species as well as predicting the invasive potential of Caspian Sea species into world oceans.

The importance of process automation is associated with increased efficiency and performance both in the data pre-processing phase and in the post-analysis of the results generated by the packages and modeling programs. The Model-R framework was developed with the main objective of unifying pre-existing ecological niche modeling tools into a common framework and building a web interface that automates steps of the modeling process and occurrence data retrieval. The web interface includes RJabot, a functionality that allows for searching and retrieving occurrence data from Jabot, the main reference on botanical collections management system in Brazil. It returns data in a suitable format to be consumed by other components of the framework. Currently, the tools are multi-projection, they can thus be applied to different sets of temporal and spatial data. Model-R is also multi-algorithm, with seven algorithms available for modeling: BIOCLIM, Mahalanobis distance, Maxent, GLM, RandomForest, SVM, and DOMAIN. The algorithms as well as the entire modeling process may be parametrized using command-line tools or through the web interface. We hope that the use of this application, not only by modeling specialists but also as a tool for policy makers, will be a significant contribution to the continuous development of biodiversity conservation analysis.

They are rapidly progressing northwestward, closely approaching the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian seas. The shift in range locally leads to profound ecological changes where amphisteginids have become the dominant species along entire stretches of coastline. Mass deposits of amphisteginids reflect an increased carbonate production and reduced assemblage diversity, and these are likely to trigger major changes in ecosystem functioning. It is anticipated that the ongoing warming trend will convey the northwestward migration of amphisteginid foraminifers. To project future species distributions we applied a species-distribution model (SDM) that is based on ecological niche constraints of current distribution ranges. Our model indicates that further warming is likely to cause a northwest-ward range extension and predicts dispersal through the straits of Sicily, Messina, and Otranto into the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas. Our results corroborate reports that show a remarkable increase and range expansion of tropical species, indicating a continued meridionalization of the Mediterranean Sea.","Langer, M.R.; Weinmann, A.E.; Lötters, S.; Rödder, D.",WOS:000307033800004,"Weinmann, Anna, A.E.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsjfr.42.3.234,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Amphistegina,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate biogeographic shell shape variation in the marine gastropod <em>Trophon geversianus</em> across most of its distributional range, covering 14 degrees of latitude. Samples come from death assemblages which have the potential to unveil biogeographic patterns along spatio-temporal scales and are not affected by short-term volatility in comparison with living assemblages. We performed morphometric analyses on shells from death assemblages, and compared shape variation between mid-Holocene and modern shells from one southern site. Multivariate analyses identified two morphotypes matching the biogeographic regions of the Argentine Sea that segregates a warm-temperate from a cold-temperate zone. The Magellan province morphotype is characterized by a larger shell, lower spire height, and higher aperture length than the Argentinean province morphotype. This change in shell shape is significantly correlated to sea surface temperature, even after accounting for spatial autocorrelation, which could be indirectly influencing intraspecific morphoclines via shifts in growth rates. On the other side, shell size and shape variations were also detected (size increase over recent geological time) between mid-Holocene and modern specimens at the Beagle Channel, which could be attributed to paleoenvironmental changes and to shifts in predator-prey relationships. Our study illustrates the usefulness of death assemblages for revealing large-scale patterns of shell-shape variability in mollusk species, and highlights the spatial coincidence of intraspecific morphological differentiation with the transition zone between biogeographic provinces of the Argentine Sea.","Malvé, M.E.; Rivadeneira, M.M.; Gordillo, S.",WOS:000451814300002,"Rivadeneira, Marcelo, M.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2018.060,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Trophon geversianus,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To optimize management efforts of high-risk species, we must quantify risk of invasion at scales relevant to management efforts. Here we provide an updated and improved detailed-level risk assessment (DLRA) for <i>Didemnum vexillum</i> that uses new methods and tools to quantify and discriminate risk of invasion to the region. The screening level risk assessment framework CMIST (Canadian Marine Invasive Screening Tool) was used in a novel context to calculate uncertainty-adjusted invasion risk scores for 13 assessment zones in Atlantic Canada. Assessments were informed by 1) environmental niche modelling (MaxENT) to predict areas suitable for establishment; 2) source-based vector analysis to quantify potential for arrival and spread of <i>D. vexillum</i> via high-risk vectors (i.e., commercial vessels, ferries, fishing vessels, and aquaculture transfers); and 3) updated ecological data from the literature. Overall invasion risk, likelihood of invasion, and impact of invasion were highest in Bay of Fundy assessment zones and lowest in the most northern zones (St. Lawrence estuary, northern Gulf and the east coast of Newfoundland). Connectivity with source zones of <i>D. vexillum</i> via both natural (e.g., currents) and anthropogenic vectors (e.g., vessels) is highest in the Bay of Fundy due to proximity to established populations and high levels of vessel traffic. Potential for impacts is highest where vulnerable populations (e.g., scallops) and highly or moderately suitable areas for establishment exist. These areas are in the Minas Basin, Chignecto Bay, southwest New Brunswick, and southwest Nova Scotia with smaller areas in Mahone Bay and offshore on Western Bank and Sable Island Bank. Projections of environmental suitability for 2075 show a northeastward shift, with areas of high suitability retained in the Bay of Fundy and expanding into the Northumberland Strait. To reduce further local spread in the Bay of Fundy, bottom-disturbing activities, such as dredging and trawling where <i>D. vexillum</i> is present, should be addressed. In addition, movement of vessels between source areas and areas of high environmental suitability should be monitored, especially in anomalously warm years when populations are likely to be larger. Targeted monitoring of areas of current and future environmental suitability with high connectivity to source zones of <i>D. vexillum</i> should also be considered to improve early detection of new populations.","Moore, A.; Lowen, B.; DiBacco, C.",WOS:000438779100002,"Moore, Andrea, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2018.9.1.02,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Didemnum vexillum,,,"risk assessment, aquatic invasive species, environmental niche modelling, vector analysis, CMIST, colonial tunicate",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We transform the predicted occurrence probability, through ArcGIS, to map the habitat suitability index (HSI) of ＂Alnus formorsana＂ that approximately corresponds with the observed vegetation in 9 nearby landslide areas. Based on our findings, we discuss the future challenges related to SDM. The proposed approach can be used in the future to facilitate proper application of native plants in soil and water conservation.","Chiu, C.-A.; Hsu, H.-S.; Lin, S.-H.",,"Hsu, Hsien-Sheng, H.-S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.29417/JCSWC.201409_45(3).0006,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,Alnus formosana,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporating community-centered indicators and SES drivers and exposures of change into coastal management can help anticipate and mitigate human and/or coastal vulnerability. We have proposed a new index to measure the social-ecological vulnerability of coastal fishing communities (Index of Coastal Vulnerability [ICV]) based on species, ecosystem, and social indicators. The ICV varies from 0 (no vulnerability) to 1 (very high vulnerability) and is composed of 3 components: species vulnerability, i.e., fish biological traits; ecosystem vulnerability, i.e., environmental indicators of ecosystem health; and adaptive capacity, i.e., human ability to cope with changes. We tested the ICV of Brazil’s 17 coastal states. The average ICV for the Brazilian coast was 0.77, and variation was low among states. More than half of the coastal states revealed very high vulnerability (> 0.8). The ecosystem vulnerability values were worse than the adaptive capacity and species vulnerability values, and the North and Northeast regions were revealed to be vulnerable hot spots. Additionally, we investigated how the ICV related to specific anthropogenic risks, i.e., fish landing richness, fishery instability, market, coastal extension, and coastal population, and found that states with fewer species landings and higher coastal populations presented higher ICVs. At a time when human impacts are overtaking natural processes, understanding how these impacts lead to coastal vulnerability can help improve conservation policies. For this case study, we suggest both fisheries management measures and restoration of sensitive habitats to protect species and decrease vulnerability. The integrated evaluation developed here could be used as a baseline for coastal monitoring and conservation planning and be applied to coastal regions in which governments evaluate both social and biological aspects.","Silva, M.R.O.; Pennino, M.G.; Lopes, P.F.M.",WOS:000506574000019,"Silva, Monalisa, M.R.O.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.5751/es-11185-240404,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,Anthropocene; coupled system; ecosystem services; human ecology; resource dependency,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mussels usually form multilayered beds, and shell thickness is also expected to be affected by density and layering due to intraspecific competition. In this work, we explored the geographical variation of shell thickness in the intertidal mussel <i>Perumytilus purpuratus</i> between 18° and 42°S along the southeastern Pacific coast. We tested the hypothesis that there was a positive relationship between shell thickness and SST, and then we explored other variables that could have an effect on thickness, such as density, number of layers, and others environmental variables (pH and calcite concentration). The expected positive linear relationship between shell thickness and sea surface temperature was not found, but when the other population variables were included in the analysis, an unexpected inverse SST-thickness relationships appeared as significant, probably because this species could be adapted to colder and more acid seawater as are those of the tips of South America. Thickness was also negatively affected by density, which was expected for a gregarious species showing high intraspecific competition. Finally, our results highlight the importance of including density and crowding effects when macroscale patterns are explored, particularly in gregarious species, since these patterns could also be modulated by density-dependent processes, which might then override latitudinal trends of shell thickness when they are not included in the analyses.","Briones, C.; Rivadeneira, M.M.; Fernández, M.; Guiñez, R.",WOS:000347783300002,"Fernández, Miriam, M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/bblv227n3p221,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Perumytilus purpuratus,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the scale of a single microbe to the entire Earth system, biological and environmental processes have coevolved over billions of years into a complex system of interactions and feedbacks that together produce the geochemical and ecological conditions we observe around us. Community-scale processes result in net biogeochemical fluxes, which vary across regional and global scales in predictable patterns. At the community, regional, and global scale, this dissertation addresses a question central to our understanding of environmental microbial systems: How do microbial community interactions with their environment govern their functional and ecological role in the ecosystem, and how do environmental conditions shape the distribution and functional capacities of microbial genetic diversity? I demonstrate that microbial carbon cycling capacities in warm core ring waters originating from the Gulf Stream during an eddy intrusion event on the Mid-Atlantic Bight continental slope are distinct from those occurring in other shelf and shelf break water masses, illuminating the relationship between marine microbial communities and physical processes at the regional scale. As these eddy intrusion events likely increase in the future, these regional scale interactions have functional and biogeochemical implications in both present and future oceans. At the global scale, I build models to accurately predict genetic diversity of the key marine heterotroph SAR86 from environmental variables, identifying five previously unrecognized ecotypes within the SAR86 clade characterized by distinct environmental distributions, and resulting in the first global-resolution projections of SAR86 ecotype biogeography. From the community to the global scale, each level of inquiry demands solutions tailored to address the key challenges and opportunities unique to it, and new approaches are brought to bear at small and large scales, developing a more effective method to measure microbial activities in sediments to expand the range of environments for which microbial activity measurements are feasible, and providing a data discovery tool that harnesses the potential of publicly available sequencing datasets to scale data-driven discovery to ever more complex microbial systems.","Hoarfrost, A.",,"Hoarfrost, Adrienne, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.17615/xwx5-1b07,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

University of Toronto; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology: Toronto. xiii, 178 pp.","The spatial distribution of genetic variation across landscapes is influenced by physical features that facilitate or restrict movement and natural selection driven by environmental heterogeneity. Many marine organisms undergo a pelagic larval stage, during which time ocean currents influence dispersal and the degree of gene flow. Furthermore, gradients in temperature, salinity, and other environmental conditions produce spatially varying selection pressures across species ranges. In the first part of my thesis, I offer a novel perspective for marine conservation that emphasizes the importance of considering both connectivity (where connectivity is maintained by dispersal) and the potential for marine populations to adapt to their environment. To do so, I highlight how genomic data can be used to infer population connectivity (i.e. based on neutral genetic variation) and environmental selection (i.e. based on putatively adaptive genetic variation) in the context of marine reserve networks. Next, using a genomic dataset derived from restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), I investigated the impact of ocean currents and environmental variables on spatial patterns of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in the commercially harvested giant California sea cucumber (P. californicus) along the northeastern Pacific coast. The results showed evidence for population structure despite the potential for widespread gene flow, and demonstrated that accounting for directionality of ocean currents explained genetic variation better than between-site geographic distances. Strong associations between sea bottom temperature and putatively adaptive loci were identified at a broad spatial scale, as well as moderate evidence that surface salinity and bottom current velocities contribute to regional patterns of adaptive differentiation. In a study using simulations of larval dispersal coupled with demo-genetic simulations, I found that potential dispersal was spatially restricted with shorter pelagic larval duration (PLD), but there was no difference between a model of diffusive (isotropic) larval transport and oceanographic (anisotropic) transport. However, several important caveats were highlighted that should be addressed in future work. Collectively, my thesis integrates genomic, environmental, and oceanographic data to understand the role of seascape features on connectivity and adaptation, with implications for marine conservation plans that aim to connect marine populations and support adaptive responses to environmental change.","Xuereb, A.",,"Xuereb, Amanda, A.",,,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,biophysical modeling; marine invertebrate; seascape genomics,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from ten microsatellite markers showed significant genetic differentiation among and between North Pacific Ocean metapopulations. Isolation by distance, foraging segregation, site fidelity, oceanic conditions, and divergent breeding times are suggested to promote genetic differentiation for rhinoceros auklets. Using a population genetic approach, I tested if assignment tests could identify the genetic origin of rhinoceros auklets found at sea.

Peracarid crustaceans are one of the dominant and most species-rich groups of the SO benthos. To date, our knowledge on the influence of environmental variables in shaping abundance and species composition in the SO’s peracarid assemblages is limited, and with regard to ice coverage it is unknown. The aim of our study was to assess the influence of sea ice coverage, chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton concentrations on abundance, distribution and assemblage structure of peracarids. In addition, the influence of other physical parameters on peracarid abundance was assessed, including depth, temperature, salinity, sediment type, current velocity, oxygen, iron, nitrate, silicate and phosphate. Peracarids were sampled with an epibenthic sledge (EBS) in different areas of the Atlantic sector of the SO and in the Weddell Sea. Sampling areas were characterized by different regimes of ice coverage (the ice free South Orkney Islands, the seasonally ice-covered Filchner Trough and the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula including the Prince Gustav Channel which was formerly covered by a perennial ice shelf). In total 64766 individuals of peracarids were collected and identified to order level including five orders: Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda, Mysidacea, and Tanaidacea. Amphipoda was the most abundant taxon, representing 32% of the overall abundances, followed by Cumacea (31%), Isopoda (29%), Mysidacea (4%), and Tanaidacea (4%). The Filchner Trough had the highest abundance of peracarids, while the South Orkney Islands showed the lowest abundance compared to other areas. Ice coverage was the main environmental driver shaping the abundance pattern and assemblage structure of peracarids and the latter were positively correlated with ice coverage and chlorophyll-a concentration. We propose that the positive correlation between sea ice and peracarid abundances is likely due to phytoplankton blooms triggered by seasonal sea ice melting, which might increase the food availability for benthos. Variations in ice coverage extent and seasonality due to climate change would strongly influence the abundance and assemblage structure of benthic peracarids.","Di Franco, D.; Linse, K.; Griffiths, H.J.; Haas, C.; Saeedi, H.; Brandt, A.",WOS:000577101700001,"Brandt, Angelika, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.554663,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Peracarida,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using species distribution models (SDMs), we aimed at predicting trends in habitat shifts of two seaweed species of commercial interest in the Subantarctic Patagonian region in response to ongoing environmental changes across temperate South America and worldwide. We gathered occurrence data from direct, on-site visual, and taxonomic identification (2009–2018) from global databases of species occurrence and from the scientific literature. We built the SDMs selecting putative predictors of biological relevance to <i>Lessonia flavicans</i> and <i>Gigartina skottsbergii</i>. We calibrated the SDMs using MaxEnt and GLMs for model evaluation, splitting our occurrence datasets into two parts: for model training and for model testing. The models were projected to future climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) to examine trends in shifting habitat suitability for each species. Maximum sea surface temperature was the main predictor variable, followed by minimum nitrate concentration, explaining both species’ distributional shift across Subantarctic shorelines by the year 2050. Projection of the SDM for each species under altered environmental conditions to 30–40&nbsp;years into the future resulted in a south poleward shift with a reduction in habitat range for both species. Such responses would threaten their persistence, local marine species richness, biodiversity, ecological function, and thereby, the commercial and ecosystem services provided by <i>L. flavicans</i> and <i>G. skottsbergii</i> in Subantarctic South America.","Murcia, S.; Riul, P.; Mendez, F.; Rodriguez, J.P.; Rosenfeld, S.; Ojeda, J.; Marambio, J.; Mansilla, A.",WOS:000521873000001,"Murcia, Silvia, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02084-6,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although these ecosystem engineers have a facilitating role for some species, they may exclude or compete with others. The honeycomb worm <i>Sabellaria alveolata</i> (<a href=""#B91"">Linnaeus, 1767</a>) is an important foundation species, commonly found from northwest Ireland to northern Mauritania, whose reef structures increase the physical complexity of the marine benthos, supporting high levels of biodiversity. Local patterns and regional differences in taxonomic and functional diversity were examined in honeycomb worm reefs from 10 sites along the northeastern Atlantic to explore variation in diversity across biogeographic regions and the potential effects of environmental drivers. While taxonomic composition varied across the study sites, levels of diversity remained relatively constant along the European coast. Assemblages showed high levels of species turnover compared to differences in richness, which varied primarily in response to sea surface temperatures and sediment content, the latter suggesting that local characteristics of the reef had a greater effect on community composition than the density of the engineering species. In contrast, the functional composition of assemblages was similar regardless of taxonomic composition or biogeography, with five functional groups being observed in all sites and only small differences in abundance in these groups being detected. Functional groups represented primarily filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, with the notable absence of herbivores, indicating that the reefs may act as biological filters for some species from the local pool of organisms. Redundancy was observed within functional groups that may indicate that honeycomb worm reefs can offer similar niche properties to its associated assemblages across varying environmental conditions. These results highlight the advantages of comparing taxonomic and functional metrics, which allow identification of a number of ecological processes that structure marine communities.","Muller, A.; Poitrimol, C.; Nunes, F.L.D.; Boyé, A.; Curd, A.; Desroy, N.; Firth, L.B.; Bush, L.; Davies, A.J.; Lima, F.P.; Marzloff, M.P.; Meneghesso, C.; Seabra, R.; Dubois, S.F.",WOS:000651362100001,"Seabra, Rui, R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.654141,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is mounting evidence that these habitats are in decline, both in range and productivity. Acoustic propagation modelling has been used to identify primary productivity in seagrass beds, and work is ongoing in development as a method of providing large scale measurements of productivity in macroalgae forests. Acoustic predictive models require knowledge of the material properties of interest, yet little is known about the acoustic properties of seaweed species. As a preliminary step towards acoustic modelling of seaweed systems, this study investigates the acoustic properties of Ecklonia radiata, a key species in temperate Australian marine systems. Measuring sound speed in macroalgae, as with other biological material, provides unique challenges due to their intrinsic morphological and anatomical characteristics. Using a range of frequencies between 2-10 MHz different methods are proposed to measure sound speed both directly and indirectly. The measurements show a consistent result, with variation according to tissue type. This research provides an important first step towards the development of acoustic propagation models in kelp forest ecosystems.","Randall, J.; Hermand, J.-P.",,"Hermand, Jean-Pierre, J.-P.","Acoustics and Environmental Hydroacoustics Lab, Universite Libre de Bruxelles",https://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4799785,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying geographic provinces from the past may provide clues into genetic affiliations through time and provide some insight into how some coral species might respond to contemporary climate change. Coral habitat in the Indo-Pacific was reduced by 70% in the LGM. We identified five Indo-Pacific biogeographical provinces for corals during the LGM — (i) the western Indian Ocean, (ii) Southeast Asia, (iii) Indonesia and northwestern Australia, (iv) northeastern Australia and the Pacific Islands, and (v) the eastern Pacific. These provinces align with provinces recently identified using genetic markers. Given that the Quaternary was dominated by glacial conditions, the distributional legacies left through glacial dominance over that 2.6 million-year period may have also left evolutionary legacies. These glacial legacies may explain why contemporary corals live close to their upper thermal thresholds, which in turn have major consequences as we move into unprecedented rates of ocean warming.","Cacciapaglia, C.W.; Bush, M.B.; van Woesik, R.",,"Bush, Mark, M.B.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.21425/f5fbg50008,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,"coral reef, climate change, hindcast, species distribution modeling, refugia, last glacial maximum, biogeographical provinces",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, marine conservation is challenging, especially for data-poor species, whose habitats and threats are understudied. My dissertation explored how to address such challenges at two large spatial scales (in China and globally), with a focus on the little studied seahorses (Hippocampus spp.). In the first two data chapters, I explored the utility of various sources of information about species and habitat covariates in species distribution models (SDMs). My results from the first chapter showed that local ecological knowledge provided useful biogeographic data of five Chinese seahorse species to predict their distributions, which were mainly associated with ocean temperature. My second chapter at the global scale indicated that integrating citizen sciences, museum collections, and research-grade data with continuous predictors derived the best SDM models; these models predicted reliable habitat maps for 33 out of 42 species that were primarily associated with depths, proximity to macrohabitats (e.g., sponges), pH, and ocean temperature. In the third analytical chapter, I explored global threat patterns and conservation status for 42 seahorse species with two cumulative-human-impact (CHI) models (spatial and non-spatial) and random forest (RF) models. I found that human-impact indices (from the CHI models) can be used to predict conservation status at high accuracies (87% and 96%) in RF models. Applying a non-spatial CHI model derived indices better predicted conservation status, while using a spatial CHI model identified distribution patterns of threats. In the fourth data chapter, I integrated the derived biogeographic and threat maps in a novel framework to set conservation priorities for seahorse habitats in China and globally, using Marxan software. I found that the two major outputs of Marxan (i.e., selection frequency and best solution) were useful to determine feasible priority solutions at large spatial scales. My results identified valuable datasets and approaches to advancing ecological and conservation knowledge for data-poor marine species, an essential precursor to action for the ocean.","Zhang, X.",,"Zhang, Xiong, X.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0376121,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of VBR in alleviating erosion of personal values remains unclear.</p>            </section>                  <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jan13514-sec-0003"">                        <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jan13514-sec-0003-title""> Design</h3>                        <p>A cross-professional longitudinal cohort study was commenced at one university in England in 2016 with data collection points at the end of years one, two and three. Non-probability consecutive sampling resulted in 42 healthcare students (8 adult, 8 child and 9 mental health nursing and 17 midwifery students) taking part.</p>            </section>                  <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jan13514-sec-0004"">                        <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jan13514-sec-0004-title""> Methods</h3>                        <p>Six semi-structured focus groups were conducted at the end of participants’ Year One (DC1). Data analysis incorporated inductive and deductive approaches in a hybrid synthesis.</p>            </section>                  <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jan13514-sec-0005"">                        <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jan13514-sec-0005-title""> Findings</h3>                        <p>Participants described a ‘values journey’ where their values, particularly communication, courage and wanting to make a difference, were both challenged and retained. Participants personal journeys also acknowledged the: ‘courage it takes to use values’; ‘reality of values in practice’ and ‘need for self-reflection on values’.</p>            </section>                  <section class=""article-section__content"" id=""jan13514-sec-0006"">                        <h3 class=""article-section__sub-title section1"" id=""jan13514-sec-0006-title""> Conclusion</h3>                        <p>A ‘values journey’ may begin early in a healthcare student's education programme. This is important to recognize so that appropriate interventions designed to support students in higher education and clinical practice can be implemented. The values incorporated in VBR should be continually evaluated for fitness for purpose.</p>","Callwood, A.; Bolger, S.; Allan, H.T.",WOS:000430121900016,"Callwood, Alison, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jan.13514,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
