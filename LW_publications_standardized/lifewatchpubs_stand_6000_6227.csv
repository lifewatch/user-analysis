Species distribution model of cetaceans in relation to environmental factors at two locations in the North Atlantic. <i>Plymouth Student Scientist 12(1)</i>: 3-24","Cetaceans in the North Atlantic are under threat from the increasing pressure and demand placed on the sea by humans. In order to conserve cetacean populations, legislative acts such as the EC Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) are calling for protected areas to be established. Species distribution models have been used in this study as a tool to outline habitat preference of cetaceans in the Celtic Sea and eastern North Atlantic, helping to determine the boundaries for protected areas. Remotely-sensed environmental data was analysed against visual boat survey data using boosted regression tree modelling. A review of the literature emphasised the need for site specific analysis due to the variability in physical oceanographic processes. This was reflected in the results with the most important variable being chlorophyll at Baltimore and water depth at Penzance. The optimal depth was calculated at 30 – 50 m for both sites. The optimal range of chlorophyll was between 1.8 – 2.5 mgm-3 with an increase in cetacean sightings towards the upper limit. A preferred sea surface temperature of 14.6 – 15 °C was found at the Baltimore site and 15.5 – 15.6 °C was found at the Penzance site. The need for fine scale analysis of oceanographic properties and their relation to species distribution is recognised, as well as an expansion of this study to capture the full range of environmental variability at these locations.","Adams, L.",,"Adams, Laura, L.",,,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Cetacea,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent phylogenetic and population genetic analysis support the existence of a genetic complex described as <i>C. intestinalis</i> with two main dominant species (sp A and B) occurring worldwide. In Chile, the species has been observed around 30°S of latitude, but no official reports exist for the presence of <i>C. intestinalis</i> in southern regions (above 40°S), where most of the mollusk aquaculture centers are located. Here, we used occurrences from multiple invaded regions and extensive field sampling to model and validate the environmental conditions that allow the species to persist and to find the geographic areas with the most suitable environmental conditions for the spread of <i>C. intestinalis</i> in the Chilean coast. By studying the potential expansion of <i>C. intestinalis</i> southward in the Chilean Coast, we aimed to provide valuable information that might help the development of control plans before the species becomes a significant problem, especially above 40°S. Our results highlight that, by using portions of the habitat that are apparently distinguishable, the species seem to be not only genetically distinct, but ecologically distinct as well. The two regional models fitted for sp A and for sp B showed disagreement on which sections of Chilean coastline are considered more suitable for these species. While the model for sp A identifies moderately to highly suitable areas between 30° and 40°S, the model for sp B classifies the areas around 45°S as the most appropriate. Data from field sampling show a positive linear relationship between density of <i>C. intestinalis</i> and the index of suitability for sp A in aquaculture centers. Understanding the relation of the distinct species with the surrounding environment provided valuable insights about probable routes of dispersion in Chile, especially into those areas considered suitable for aquaculture activities but where the species has not yet been recorded. We discuss the implications of our findings as a useful tool to anticipate the invasion of such harmful invasive species with regard to the most relevant environmental variables.","Januario, S.M.; Estay, S.A.; Labra, F.A.; Lima, M.",WOS:000364331500002,"Januario, Stella, S.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1357,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Ciona intestinalis,,,"Aquaculture, Invasion risk, Population abundance, Species distribution, Suitability index",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying priority areas and spatial fisheries impact for addressing shark conservation in adata-limited context. MSc Thesis. Universidad de los Andes: Colombia. 23 pp.","Shark distribution and fishing grounds used by local communities are usually overlapped, although this coincidence is not straightforwardly distinguished in a data-limited context. We aim to delimit critical areas for shark conservation using a comprehensive spatial model to determine the co-occurrence area of the most fished shark species considering the distribution of the fishing effort and protection effectiveness of MPA'S in the Colombian Caribbean. Predicted distribution areas for nine frequent landed species were obtained using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model fed with species presence and environmental open-access data, while the fishing effort was derived from interview-based maps already available. The co-occurrence areas (COAs) were derived from the nine shark species habitat suitability models by using a 70% and 85% threshold cut, for defining a general and highest probability areas of distribution, respectively. Three independent co-occurrence areas were delimited along the Colombian Caribbean Sea: Morrosquillo Gulf, Santa Marta-Guajira and San Andres and Providence Archipelago, without finding an environmental link between them. By considering the highest probability of co-occurrence, 16 areas were well differentiated. Fishing grounds and COAs were unequally overlapped (total: 45%, mean: 26,76%) while marine protected areas did not offer effective protection against fishing pressure in areas identified as critical for conservation of the shark species in the analysis. This suggests a noticeable spatial relationship between co-occurrence shark areas and fishing grounds used by local fishing communities. The use of this methodology enables identification of co-occurrence areas in a data-limited context, which can be used as starting point for defining the priority areas for shark conservation in the Colombian Caribbean which will allow stakeholders to implement future management guidelines in well-defined areas.","Monsalve Rocha, S.",,"Monsalve Rocha, Sabrina, S.",,,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,"Habitat-suitability model, co-occurrence areas, shark conservation, data-limited spatial modeling, small-scale fisheries",Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

To fully capitalize on the potential discoveries from this genomic revolution, the rapidly increasing number of high-quality genomes requires effective pairing with rigorous taxonomic characterizations of specimens and the contextualization of their ecological relevance. However, to date there is no formal framework that genomicists, taxonomists, and coral scientists can collectively use to systematically acquire and link these data. Spurred by the recently announced “Coral symbiosis sensitivity to environmental change hub” under the “Aquatic Symbiosis Genomics Project” - a collaboration between the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to generate gold-standard genome sequences for coral animal hosts and their associated Symbiodiniaceae microalgae (among the sequencing of many other symbiotic aquatic species) - we outline consensus guidelines to reconcile different types of data. The metaorganism nature of the coral holobiont provides a particular challenge in this context and is a key factor to consider for developing a framework to consolidate genomic, taxonomic, and ecological (meta)data. Ideally, genomic data should be accompanied by taxonomic references, i.e., skeletal vouchers as formal morphological references for corals and strain specimens in the case of microalgal and bacterial symbionts (cultured isolates). However, exhaustive taxonomic characterization of all coral holobiont member species is currently not feasible simply because we do not have a comprehensive understanding of all the organisms that constitute the coral holobiont. Nevertheless, guidelines on minimal, recommended, and ideal-case descriptions for the major coral holobiont constituents (coral animal, Symbiodiniaceae microalgae, and prokaryotes) will undoubtedly help in future referencing and will facilitate comparative studies. We hope that the guidelines outlined here, which we will adhere to as part of the Aquatic Symbiosis Genomics Project sub-hub focused on coral symbioses, will be useful to a broader community and their implementation will facilitate cross- and meta-data comparisons and analyses.","Voolstra, C.R.; Quigley, K.M.; Davies, S.W.; Parkinson, J.E.; Peixoto, R.S.; Aranda, M.; Baker, A.C.; Barno, A.R.; Barshis, D.J.; Benzoni, F.; Bonito, V.; Bourne, D.G.; Buitrago-Lopez, C.; Bridge, T.C.L.; Chan, C.X.; Combosch, D.J.; Craggs, J.; Frommlet, J.C.; Herrera, S.; Quattrini, A.M.; Röthig, T.; Reimer, J.D.; Rubio-Portillo, E.; Suggett, D.J.; Villela, H.; Ziegler, M.; Sweet, M.",,"Baker, Andrew, A.C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.701784,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Scleractinia, ""Symbiodiniaceae""",Taxonomy,,"coral reef, coral holobiont, prokaryotes, genome sequencing, genomics",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially true for those components of biodiversity providing essential ecosystem functions and for which standard surveys may underestimate their real taxonomic diversity due to high degree of cryptic diversity and inherent diagnosis difficulties, such as meiofaunal communities. Within this context, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding may provide a fast and reliable way to refine and scale-up the characterization of biological diversity in complex environmental samples, allowing to bypass issues related to biodiversity estimation. Moreover, the possibility of integrating eDNA metabarcoding-derived data with tools and methods rooted in network theory would deepen the knowledge on the structuring processes of ecological communities in ways that cannot be predicted from studying individual species/communities in isolation. Here, a sediment eDNA metabarcoding of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and nuclear hypervariable V4 region of the 18S rDNA (18S) was used to reconstruct the bipartite networks linking intertidal meiofaunal OTUs and sampling stations from three estuaries of the North-Western Iberian Peninsula. Null models were used to identify the role of environmental and spatial constraints on the structure of COI- and 18S-derived networks and to characterize the macroecological features of surveyed phyla. Our results show the feasibility of eDNA metabarcoding to capture a fair amount of diversity hard to detect with standard survey procedures and to identify hierarchical spatial structures in intertidal meiofaunal assemblages, ultimately suggesting a restricted distributional range mostly driven by niche-based processes.","Bellisario, B.; Fais, M.; Duarte, S.; Vieira, P.E.; Canchaya, C.; Costa, F.O.",,"Canchaya, Carlos, C.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00828-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Meiofauna · eDNA · Metabarcoding · Bipartite networks · Modularity,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DMAs were observed during periods of low nitrate availability in Southern California coastal waters, highlighting the potential importance of diazotrophs during N depleted conditions. Eleven long-term (16–32 days) litter bag decomposition experiments with various macroalgae, especially those with high (> 10) C:N ratios, resulted in much higher BNF rates (maximum: 693 nmol N × g<sup>−1</sup> (dw) × h<sup>−1</sup>) than observed with living macroalgae. BNF rates were lower at the beginning of macroalgal decomposition but rapidly increased during the second phase before declining towards the end of decomposition. Labile carbon availability is likely influencing BNF rates throughout macroalgal degradation and limits BNF in the final decomposition stage. Comparable dark and light BNF rates with most macroalgae surveyed suggest macroalgal detrital systems are an overlooked, potentially global, niche for heterotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Lastly, suppressed BNF rates with sodium molybdate additions highlight the prevalence of sulfate reducing diazotrophs.","Raut, Y.; Capone, D.G.",WOS:000661288300001,"Raut, Yubin, Y.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15622,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the spatial analysis, the arrival of <em>Pterois</em> spp. could affect almost 200 species, several of which are endemic and of commercial importance.

Novel products derived from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, as well as future Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and RADAR missions, may play a key role in improving model performance. In this perspective piece, we demonstrate how modern sensors onboard satellites, planes and unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionizing the way we can detect and monitor both plant and animal species in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as well as allowing the emergence of novel predictor variables appropriate for species distribution modeling. We hope this interdisciplinary perspective will motivate ecologists, remote sensing experts and modelers to work together for developing a more refined SDM framework in the near future.","He, K.S.; Bradley, B.A.; Cord, A.F.; Rocchini, D.; Tuanmu, M.-N.; Schmidtlein, S.; Turner, W.; Wegmann, M.; Pettorelli, N.",WOS:000448239100002,"Schmidtlein, Sebastian, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rse2.7,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these invasive species, Ciona robusta, has now spread to the Korea Strait, the East Sea, and Jeju Island in connection with the climate change but not the Yellow Sea in Korea. Currently, the spread and distribution of C. robusta is increasingly damaging aquaculture and related facilities. Therefore, this study aims to identify the spread of C. robusta and potential habitats and to secure a data for the prevention of effective management measures due to climate change as well as damage the reduction in future through the prediction of spread. We used environmental variables in BioOracle. Also, the potential habitat and distribution of C. robusta was predicted using MaxEnt, a species distribution model. Two different RCP scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) were specified to predict the future distributions of C. robusta. The results showed that the biggest environmental factor affecting the distribution of C. robusta was the salinity as well as the highest distribution and potential habitats existent in the East Sea and around Jeju Island.","Park, J.-U.; Hong, J.; Kim, D.G.; Yoon, T.J.; Shin, S.",,"Shin, Sook, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.11626/kjeb.2018.36.4.687,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Ciona robusta,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reef fish provide essential protein and income for many people, and the impacts of commercial and high-intensity subsistence fishing on reef fish are well documented. However, how fish communities respond to low levels of subsistence fishing using traditional techniques (fishing for food, few fishers) is less well understood. We use three atolls in the Marshall Islands as a model system to quantify effects of commercial and subsistence fishing on reef fish communities, compared to a near-pristine baseline. Unexpectedly, fish biomass was highest on the commercially-fished atoll where the assemblage was dominated by herbivores (50% higher than other atolls) and contained few top predators (70% lower than other atolls). By contrast, fish biomass and trophic composition did not differ between pristine and subsistence-fished atolls – top predators were abundant on both. We show that in some cases, reefs can support fishing by small communities to provide food but still retain intact fish assemblages. Low-intensity subsistence fishing may not always harm marine food webs, and we suggest that its effects depend on the style and intensity of fishing practised and the type of organisms targeted.","Martin, T.S.H.; Connolly, R.M.; Olds, A.D.; Ceccarelli, D.M.; Fenner, D.E.; Schlacher, T.A.; Beger, M.",WOS:000412707000013,"Olds, Andrew, A.D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsx043,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed how oxygen concentrations and other environmental predictors explain variation in echinoderm assemblages at these mesophotic systems, where this group is among the predominant fauna. We compiled data on echinoderm taxa at 91 sampling stations, from historical and recent surveys (between 1950 and 2019), covering a longitudinal gradient of approximately 3,700 km along with the Nazca, Salas y Gómez, and Juan Fernández ridges. Uni- and multivariate model-based tools were applied to analyze the patterns of benthic fauna in relation to environmental factors. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between echinoderm species richness and depth, oxygen, and salinity. Changes in echinoderm community composition were significantly explained by oxygen, longitude, and chlorophyll-a. We observed notable species turnovers at ∼101 and ∼86°W, where assemblages tend to be more variable across stations. This turnover possibly reflects the effects of physical barriers to dispersion (e.g., currents) and habitat changes. Echinoderm assemblages observed around Easter and Desventuradas Islands presented a high occurrence of potentially endemic taxa and distinct species assemblages. This study is the first to assess the structure of mesophotic echinoderm assemblages of the southeastern Pacific Ocean along a large spatial scale. The information reported here could help design appropriate management tools for the vast, recently created, marine protected areas in the southeastern Pacific.","Mechó, A.; Dewitte, B.; Sellanes, J.; van Gennip, S.; Easton, E.E.; Gusmao, J.B.",WOS:000617908400001,"van Gennip, Simon, S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.574780,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cylix tupareomanaia, new genus and species, however, is distinguishable from all other members of the Syngnathidae by the following combination of bony autapomorphic characters: a cup-like crest present anterodorsally on the supraoccipital; and large conspicuous midventral conical spines on the cleithral symphysis and first trunk ring between the pectoral-fin bases. The new species can be further differentiated by genetic divergence in the mitochondrial COX1 gene from Acentronura breviperula, A. tentaculata, Idiotropiscis australe, and I. lumnitzeri (estimated uncorrected p-distances of 19.5%, 20.4%, 17.9%, and 18.4%, respectively). A phylogenetic hypothesis from the analysis of two nuclear loci, 18S and TMO-4C4, supports the placement of C. tupareomanaia, new genus and species, as the sister taxon to a clade comprising the genera Acentronura and Idiotropiscis. Cylix tupareomanaia, new genus and species, represents the eighth member within the pygmy pipehorse clade to be described from the Indo-Pacific and the first new genus and species of syngnathid to be reported from New Zealand since 1921.

All copepod life stages were found in spring and summer and copepod nauplii were an important part of total copepod abundance and constituted between 21,4 – 74,7% in spring and summer. Cyclopoid copepods were the most abundant group in spring and were dominated by <i>Oithona</i> spp.. Calanoid copepods became more abundant among the copepods in summer and were dominated by Acartia spp. And <i>Paracalanus/Pseudocalanus</i> spp. copepodites. <i>Microsetella</i> spp. dominated among the harpacticoid copepods and was mostly found in spring. Meroplankton abundance was low throughout the study period and constituted maximum 14,4% of total zooplankton abundance. Polychaeta and Cirripedia dominated the meroplankton in spring, while Polychaeta and Gastropoda dominated in summer. A cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis similarities among samples indicated a division of the zooplankton communities in three main periods; early spring (March), which corresponded to the pre-bloom phase in the phytoplankton community, spring (April – May) which corresponded to the bloom – late bloom phase of the phytoplankton community and summer (June – July) which represented a period of low algal biomass.","Monrad, K.",,"Monrad, Kristoffer, K.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

MA Thesis. Université de Liège: Liège. 88 pp.","As a semi-enclosed sea affected by a growing coastal urbanization, the Mediterranean is the recipient of numerous anthropic pollutants. These include trace elements (TE) and microplastics (MP), two different types of contaminants who share a common affinity for sediments. Both of them can enter and accumulate in marine organisms, causing metabolic disorders when present in excessive amounts. The potential impact of these two types of contaminants combined with their association with sediments highlight the importance of developing accurate tools of surveillance for this compartment of the marine environment, such as bioindicator species. Due to their proximity with sediments and to their feeding mode relying on detritus, sea cucumbers have been raising the interest of scientists for the monitoring of marine sediments. However, to be able to make use of the bioindicator qualities of these animal, it is crucial to better understand their relationship with the two contaminants mentioned, in order to ascertain that they reflect accurately the contamination status of their habitat. Therefore, several specimens of Holothuria tubulosa and Holothuria polii were collected during three periods of the year at three locations in the Bay of Calvi to measure the concentration in TE of their organs, with the aim of identifying the factors influencing these concentrations. In the meantime, the microplastic stomachal content of the sea cucumbers collected on the different sites was compared. This work confirms that the organ chosen for the TE analysis is the main factor influencing their concentrations. Moreover, every organ displays a different sensitivity to the sources of variability considered. Thus, the bodywall of sea cucumbers displays the lowest TE concentrations, which are homogenous between species at any time of the year and for each sampling site. On the opposite, these concentrations are the highest in the haemal system, especially in H. polii, particularly at the fish farm compared to the sewage system exit or to the STARESO station. Muscles mixed with the water vascular system record periodic variations in TE concentrations, with the highest values in summer. Finally, the concentrations measured in the respiratory trees only differ according to species, with the highest values in H. polii. In future studies using these animals as bioindicators, it will be crucial to select the organ whose sensitivity reflects best the difference in contamination that has to be highlighted, either from a temporal or from a spatial perspective. The majority of the numerous plastic debris extracted from sea cucumbers guts belonged to the class of MP, with a large dominance of fibers and filaments. Individuals collected near the fish farm ingest more plastic items, whereas those living near the exit of the sewage systems stand out from the ingestion of rubbers and fragments, as well as from a higher mean length of the ingested items. These results confirm the tendency of sea cucumbers to ingest numerous plastic debris in a way that reflects the degree of human pressure on their habitat as well as the potential of sea cucumbers as bioindicators of plastic pollution in sediments.","Dogniez, M.",,"Dogniez, Martin, M.",Université de Liège,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,University of Liège,,Belgium,o,University,Science

Along with their economic value, they are also an excellent source of proteins, vitamins, minerals, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA). The FA profiles of the adductor muscle (AM) of bivalves can be successfully used to trace their geographic origin. This approach is paramount for traceability, as it allows to expose fraudulent practices associated with the capture of bivalves from unsuitable areas for human consumption that may put food safety at risk. However, it is yet to be determined whether phylogenetic or environmental drivers prevail on the shaping of FA signatures when comparing multiple bivalve species originating from the same location or distinct geographic origins. In this study, the FA profiles of the AM of six commercially important bivalve species (<em>Cerastoderme edule, Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ruditapes philippinarum, Scrobicularia plana and Solen marginatus</em>) from Ria de Aveiro (Northwest Coast of Portugal) were compared. Furthermore, the FA profiles of the AM of <em>C. edule</em> and <em>R. phillipinarum</em> originating from Ria de Aveiro and the Tagus estuary (~250 Km apart) were also compared to identify if phylogenetic drivers prevailed over environmental ones. The FA profiles of the AM of the six bivalve species sampled in Ria de Aveiro differed significantly among themselves, displaying higher levels of similarity between species belonging to the same infraclass. The comparison of species from the same ecosystem and specimens from different ecosystems evidenced that phylogenetic drivers prevail over environmental ones on the shaping of FA profiles of the AM. These findings are important for food safety issues, as they revealed that the FA profile of the AM of a given bivalve species cannot be used as a reliable proxy for another one when aiming to trace geographic origin. The transfer of this technology to bivalve’s production ensures product’s safety, promotion and differentiation, as well as a tool against fraud.","Ricardo, F.; Gonçalves, D.; Pimentel, T.; Mamede, R.; Rosário M.

Within Africa, discussions of these issues have largely been based on the archaeological record from the south and northeast of the continent, with little evidence from eastern coastal areas leaving significant spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge. Here, we present data from Panga ya Saidi, a limestone cave complex located 15 km from the modern Kenyan coast, which represents the first long-term sequence of coastal engagement from eastern Africa. Rather than attempting to distinguish between coastal resource use and coastal adaptations, we focus on coastal engagement as a means of characterising human relationships with marine environments and resources from this inland location. We use aquatic mollusc data spanning the past 67,000 years to document shifts in the acquisition, transportation, and discard of these materials, to better understand long-term trends in coastal engagement. Our results show pulses of coastal engagement beginning with low-intensity symbolism, and culminating in the consistent low-level transport of marine and freshwater food resources, emphasising a diverse relationship through time. Panga ya Saidi has the oldest stratified evidence of marine engagement in eastern Africa, and is the only site in Africa which documents coastal resources from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene, highlighting the potential archaeological importance of peri-coastal sites to debates about marine resource relationships.","Faulkner, P.; Miller, J.M.; Quintana Morales, E.M.; Crowther, A.; Shipton, C.; Ndiema, E.; Boivin, N.; Petraglia, M.D.",,"Faulkner, Patrick, P.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256761,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By reviewing records from the World Register of Marine Species and using ancestral state reconstruction methods, we build on the fly tree of life phylogeny and ecological descriptions of marine life history. Our ancestral state reconstruction analyses suggest marine dwelling is lacking as an ancestral trait for the most recent common ancestor to Diptera. While many transitions in Empidoidea, Sciomyzoidea, Tipulomorpha, and Culicomorpha seem to have been gradual, other transitions in Tephritoidea and Tabanomorpha were found likely to have been stochastic occurrences. From the collection of 532 marine species, we reveal several independent transitions to the marine environment throughout the fly tree of life. Considering the results from our analysis, we outline potential adaptations for marine flies and discuss the barriers of colonizing the marine environment and the implications to the mechanisms for salt tolerance.","Pak, N.; Wu, S.; Gibson, J.F.",,"Pak, Nina, N.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7935,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"ancestral state reconstruction, coastal Flies, macroevolution, PASTML, WoRMS",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variations in uvigerinid distribution and their test metrics are discussed based on the main climatic and oceanographic changes through the last glacial cycle. The higher dominance of <i>Trifarina angulosa</i> during the interglacial stages suggests that this species is favored by a stronger influence of the warm, nutrient-poor and oxygen-rich North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and near-bottom currents. Uvigerinid richness, the number of larger and less elongated tests and the accumulated biomass increased during the glacial stages, when the lower continental slope was more influenced by the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) close to the bottom and nutrient-enriched surface waters. In this sense, these biotic descriptors have the potential to be applied as proxies in studies on the paleocirculation and carbon flows to the seafloor through the late Quaternary in the South Atlantic. A regression model was also formulated to convert the test length to the total test volume for Uvigerinidae, which can facilitate data acquisition in future studies, expanding their use as paleoceanographical proxies.","Santana, B.F.B.B.; Freitas, T.R.; Leonel, J.; Bonetti, C.",,"Freitas, Thaise Ricardo, T.R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marmicro.2021.102041,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Uvigerinidae,,,South Atlantic; Paleoceanography; Paleoproductivity,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to discover which these strategies is adopted by the crab larvae of <i>Panopeus lacustris</i>, samplings of mesozooplankton were performed seasonally by six sites (transect 233 km long, towards continental slope) on the Amazon Continental Shelf (ACS), through two years (July 2013 to January 2015). The temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a were registered by CTD-probe. All stages of zoea and megalopa de <i>P. lacustris</i> were founded along months, proving the hypothesis of continuous reproduction of the species. The larval dispersion pattern varies between phases, with an inversion between zoea and megalopa. The density of the zoea stages is higher in the coastal zone in brackish water up to 83 km from the coast (ZI = 2,592; ZII = 375; ZIII = 77 and ZIV = 20 larvae/100 m<sup>3</sup>) and it decreases while approaching the continental shelf break, 158 to 233 km from coast (ZI = 4; ZII = 8; ZIII = 7 and ZIV = 3 larvae/100 m<sup>3</sup>), while the non-competent phase of megalopa presents an opposite pattern (up to 83 km: M = 57 larvae/100m<sup>3</sup>; 158 to 233 km: M= 5,730 larvae/100m<sup>3</sup>), with bloom in ocean waters 233 km long (5,049 larvae/100m<sup>3</sup>) in October. Larval density responds to variations in salinity caused by the plume of the Amazon, as they occur throughout the ACS regardless of the period of the year and the flow of the river. The uniqueness of the megalopa bloom probably was originated in several sectors of the Amazon coastal entries, like the indented coastline.","Alcântara de Lima, F.; Butturi-Gomes, D.; Martinelli-Lemos, J.M.",,"Alcântara de Lima, Francielly, F.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.101960,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Brachyura, ""Panopeus lacustris""",,,Amazon river plume; Brachyura; Ecology; Estuary; Larval dispersal; Plankton,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish can hear particle motion, and a swim bladder potentially adds the additional capacity to sense sound pressure. Combining these capacities allows them to sense direction, distance, spectral content, and detailed temporal patterns. Both sound pressure and particle motion were recorded in a shallow part of the North Sea before and during exposure to a full-scale airgun array from an experimental seismic survey. Distinct amplitude fluctuations and directional patterns in the ambient noise were found to be fluctuating in phase with the tidal cycles and coming from distinct directions. It was speculated that the patterns may be determined by distant sources associated with large rivers and nearby beaches. Sounds of the experimental seismic survey were above the ambient conditions for particle acceleration up to 10 km from the source, at least as detectable for the measurement device, and up to 31 km for the sound pressure. These results and discussion provide a fresh perspective on the auditory world of fishes and a shift in the understanding about potential ranges over which they may have access to biologically relevant cues and be masked by anthropogenic noise.","Rogers, P.; Debusschere, E.; de Haan, D.; Martin, B.; Slabbekoorn, H.",,"de Haan, Dick, D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0006412,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degenerate tale of ascidian tails. <i>Integrative and Comparative Biology 61(2)</i>: 358-369. <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab022"" target=""_blank"">https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab022</a>","Ascidians are invertebrate chordates, with swimming chordate tadpole larvae that have distinct heads and tails. The head contains the small brain, sensory organs, including the ocellus (light) and otolith (gravity) and the presumptive endoderm, while the tail has a notochord surrounded by muscle cells and a dorsal nerve cord. One of the chordate features is a post-anal tail. Ascidian tadpoles are nonfeeding, and their tails are critical for larval locomotion. After hatching the larvae swim up toward light and are carried by the tide and ocean currents. When competent to settle, ascidian tadpole larvae swim down, away from light, to settle and metamorphose into a sessile adult. Tunicates are classified as chordates because of their chordate tadpole larvae; in contrast, the sessile adult has a U-shaped gut and very derived body plan, looking nothing like a chordate. There is one group of ascidians, the Molgulidae, where many species are known to have tailless larvae. The Swalla Lab has been studying the evolution of tailless ascidian larvae in this clade for over 30 years and has shown that tailless larvae have evolved independently several times in this clade. Comparison of the genomes of two closely related species, the tailed <em>Molgula oculata</em> and tailless <em>Molgula occulta</em> reveals much synteny, but there have been multiple insertions and deletions that have disrupted larval genes in the tailless species. Genomics and transcriptomics have previously shown that there are pseudogenes expressed in the tailless embryos, suggesting that the partial rescue of tailed features in their hybrid larvae is due to the expression of intact genes from the tailed parent. Yet surprisingly, we find that the notochord gene regulatory network is mostly intact in the tailless <em>M. occulta</em>, although the notochord does not converge and extend and remains as an aggregate of cells we call the “notoball.” We expect that eventually many of the larval gene networks will become evolutionarily lost in tailless ascidians and the larval body plan abandoned, with eggs developing directly into an adult. Here we review the current evolutionary and developmental evidence on how the molgulids lost their tails.","Fodor, A.C.A.; Powers, M.M.; Andrykovich, K.; Liu, J.; Lowe, E.K.; Brown, C.T.; Di Gregorio, A.; Stolfi, A.; Swalla, B.J.",,"Brown, C.

A second species infects the gulf butterfish, <i>Peprilus burti</i> Fowler, and the American harvestfish, <i>Peprilus paru</i> (L.), and it is described as a new species that occurs in coastal waters of the north-central and northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Metacercariae infecting the mesoglea of pelagic jellyfishes (<i>Bougainvillia carolinensis</i> [McCady], <i>Chrysaora quinquecirrha</i> [Desor], and <i>Stomolophus meleagris</i> Agassiz) and pelagic comb jellies (<i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> Agassiz and <i>Beroe ovata</i> Bruguière) were collected that resemble the new species but require further study to identify. Newly generated sequence fragments (<i>28S</i> rDNA) from both species of <i>Opechona</i> plus 2 other lepocreadiids collected during the study were aligned with publicly available sequences from 18 other lepocreadiids, 6 species of Aephnidiogenidae , and 2 species of Gorgocephalidae Manter, 1966. The alignment was subjected to Bayesian inference analysis rooted using a gorgocephalid.

The occupancy framework is frequently used to model species distribution with the advantage of accounting for imperfect observation, but occupancy studies typically do not define the characteristic scale of the modelled variables. We used camera trap data from winter wildlife surveys in the Swiss part of the Jura Mountains to model occupancy of wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) and roe deer (<i>Capreolus capreolus</i>). We used a three-step approach: (1) first, we identified factors influencing detectability; (2) second, we optimized the characteristic scale of each candidate explanatory variable; and (3) third, we fit multivariable, multiscale occupancy models in relation to land cover, human presence and topography. Wild boar occupancy was mainly influenced by the interaction between elevation within 2500&nbsp;m and the proportion of forested areas within a 2500&nbsp;m, with a nonsignificant additional effect of the interaction between ruggedness within 1900&nbsp;m and the proportion of forested areas within 2500&nbsp;m as well as the distance to urban areas. Roe deer occupancy was mainly associated with the interaction between ruggedness within 900&nbsp;m and the proportion of open landscape within 900&nbsp;m, with an additional nonsignificant effect of the interaction between elevation within 1500&nbsp;m and the proportion of open landscape within 900&nbsp;m as well as the distance to urban areas. Incorporating scale optimization in occupancy modelling of camera trap data can greatly improve the understanding of species-environment relationships by combining the possibility of occupancy models to correct for detection bias and simultaneously allowing to infer the characteristic scale at which certain factors influence the distribution of the organisms studied.","Wevers, J.; Beenaerts, N.; Casaer, J.; Zimmermann, F.; Artois, T.; Fattebert, J.",,"Artois, Tom, T.","Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University",https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rse2.207,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,"Camera traps, ecological neighbourhood, habitat selection, occupancy models, scale optimization, wildlife survey",Journal article,,,,,,,,,Hasselt University - Centre for Environmental Sciences (CMK),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Isaac Lea's (1792–1886) substitutions and other modifications of his own names of molluscan species. <i>Malacologia 64(1)</i>: 1-56. <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.4002/040.064.0101"" target=""_blank"">https://dx.doi.org/10.4002/040.064.0101</a>","The American conchologist Isaac Lea had a long and productive career during which he introduced more than 1,800 names of molluscan species between 1827 and 1874, the majority North American land and freshwater species. His idiosyncratic way of publishing, by describing new taxa multiple times in duplicated and variously modified journal papers as well as in retitled collections of extracts, has led to considerable difficulties in determining accurate dates of his original descriptions. He considered the reading and presentation of a manuscript before a “learned society” as the date of its original publication and therefore his own recorded dates must be approached with caution. The problem of interpreting Lea's names was compounded by the fact that Lea frequently modified his own new taxonomic names in his subsequent publications, and often without providing justification for the change. The various name versions were inconsistently applied by subsequent authors. The current paper analyses Lea's substitutions and other modifications of his own names of molluscan species and discusses 131 of his publications in this context, for which attempts at precise dating were made. The status of these “replacements” of Lea's taxonomic names were evaluated under the current ICZN <i>Code</i> (). A few additional cases of changes of Lea's names by other authors are included; these are instances in which Lea had missed a primary homonym or a secondary homonym was discovered later. While some of the names here discussed are currently resting in synonymy, others are of greater current relevance as they are in use as valid names for taxa of conservation/management concern, including IUCN and U.S.-federally listed species.</p> <p>The following 98 discussions of often-complex name changes involve 348 species-group names and their subsequent spellings, 231 of which were introduced by Lea. Based on their current taxonomic status, the names belong to 4 bivalve and 11 gastropod families, with the vast majority concentrated in Unionidae and Pleuroceridae. Under the current ICZN <i>Code</i>, the investigated changes fall into many different categories, which impacts their nomenclatural availability: 35 names changed by Lea (plus 6 by other authors) are interpreted as substitute names for junior primary homonyms, 7 of which were unnecessary; 1 name (plus 6 by others) as substitute names for junior secondary homonyms, 1 of which was unnecessary; 13 names as justified emendations; 10 names (plus 1 by another) as unjustified emendations that have not entered prevailing usage; 1 name determined by his first reviser action; 37 names (plus many by others) as incorrect subsequent spellings that are not in prevailing usage; and 1 incorrect subsequent spelling that is shown to be in prevailing usage and thus considered a correct original spelling. The concept of “prevailing usage,” ill-defined under the current (1999) ICZN <i>Code</i>, is addressed in this context. The following names in current use are corrected as follows: <i>Helix balasteriana</i> I. Lea, 1840 (taxon <i>inquirendum</i>, ?Dyakiidae), <i>Lioplax cyclostomatiformis</i> (I. Lea, 1844), <i>Diplodon demararaensis</i> (I. Lea, 1859), <i>Iheringella isocardiodes</i> I. Lea, 1856, <i>Dilatata brongniartiana</i> (I. Lea, 1843), <i>Elliptio nasutidus</i> (I. Lea, 1863), <i>Elliptio pullata</i> (I. Lea, 1857), <i>Pleurocera picta</i> (I. Lea, 1841) [instead of <i>P. curta</i> (Haldeman, 1841), which is preoccupied] and <i>Beringiana youconensis</i> (I. Lea, 1847); many others are confirmed in their recently applied spellings. This work serves as an example that the basic endeavor of summarizing available and valid names from the published literature is not always a straightforward task.</p>","Bieler, R.",WOS:000685113400001,"Bieler, Rüdiger, R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.4002/040.064.0101,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern Spain is one of the most prolific regions, and especially the so-called Asturian area. Large accumulations of shellfish led some scholars to propose the existence of intensification in the exploitation of coastal resources in the region during the Mesolithic. In this paper, shell remains (molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms) from stratigraphic units 114 and 115 (dated to the early Mesolithic c. 9 kys cal BP) at El Mazo cave (Asturias, northern Spain) were studied in order to establish resource exploitation patterns and environmental conditions. Species representation showed that limpets, top shells and sea urchins were preferentially exploited. One-millimetre mesh screens were crucial in establishing an accurate minimum number of individuals for sea urchins and to determine their importance in exploitation patterns. Environmental conditions deduced from shell assemblages indicated that temperate conditions prevailed at the time of the occupation and the morphology of the coastline was similar to today (rocky exposed shores). Information recovered relating to species representation, collection areas and shell biometry reflected some evidence of intensification (reduced shell size, collection in lower areas of exposed shores, no size selection in some units and species) in the exploitation of coastal resources through time. However, the results suggested the existence of changes in collection strategies and resource management, and periods of intense shell collection may have alternated with times of shell stock recovery throughout the Mesolithic.","García-Escárzaga, A.; Gutiérrez-Zugasti, I.; González-Morales, M.R.; Cobo-García, A.",,"Gutiérrez-Zugasti, Igor, I.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/pia-481,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Intensification, Biometry, Shell midden, Archaeomalacology, Mesolithic",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The critical role of interactions between ecological foundation species in structuring a mangrove community. PhD Thesis. Florida Atlantic University, Faculty of The Charles E. Schmidt College of Science: Boca Raton. xxiii, 184 pp.","The main objective of this research was to analyze how well my proposed Foundation Species Interaction model explained the benthic communities found on red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) prop roots. This research investigated the connections between the primary foundation species (mangroves), the dominant secondary foundations species (oysters, sponges, and barnacles), and the resulting biodiversity in order to understand the temporal and spatial variability of the ecosystems at different community levels. Chapter 1 was dedicated to explaining my change in ecological theory, the Foundation Species Interaction model. The interactions included in the model between the foundations species that were examined were the mutualistic (+, +), commensal (+, 0), and parasitic (+, -) interactions. Chapter 2 focused on exploration of the mangrove ecosystem in Southeast Florida and establishing where the secondary foundation species and prop root epibionts where found along the latitudinal gradient. The survey investigated the connections between mangroves, the dominant secondary foundations species (e.g. oysters, sponges, and barnacles), and the resulting biodiversity to understand the temporal and spatial variability of the ecosystems at different community levels. Chapter 3 was dedicated to testing the Foundation Species Interaction model’s ability to predict the biodiversity along the latitudinal gradient of the survey. The difference in mangrove prop root communities were largely explained by where the communities laid along the latitudinal gradient and by secondary foundation species presence. The shift from one foundation species to another had sizable effects on biodiversity. Chapter 4 combined the Foundation Species Interaction model with the established predation hypothesis and tested their abilities to explain biodiversity along the latitudinal gradient. This allowed for shifts in community structure to be examined for top-down and bottom-up influences. Predation effects changed along the latitudinal gradient, as the predation effects changed so did the effects of each of the individual foundation species.

This research was conducted to determine the influence of the invasive crustacean species Dikerogrammarus villosus on native crustacean species in the reach of the Drava river between Prelog and Legrad during five years in the period 2011 to 2019. This study aimed to examine the distribution and effect of Dikerogrammarus villosus expansion on native crustacean species. The field study was carried out at 27 sites between the upper end of the Dubrava Reservoir and its dam on the Drava River to the confluence of the Mura River. Qualitative samples of macrozoobenthos were collected with a benthic hand net on all available microhabitats and stored in 70% ethanol. After a laboratory analysis and the identification of crustacean samples to the species level, the results were analysed using graphic and spatial analyses. Four native and one alien invasive amphipod species were recorded (native: Gammarus fossarum, Gammarus roeselii, Synurella ambulans, and Niphargus sp.; alien: Dikerogammarus villosus), as well as one native isopod (Asellus aquaticus). In the main course of the Drava River, D. villosus has almost entirely replaced native species recorded in this study, while in the old course of Drava River (downstream dam of hydroelectric power plant Dubrava), D. villosus coexist with native species. During the study period, D. villosus has not spread into lower parts of the Bednja and Plitvica Rivers, although it was found at the confluences of these two tributaries in the Stara Drava. It is not expected that D. villosus will succeed in replacing native crustaceans in the Old Drava course downstream from the Dubrava dam. Microhabitat diversity and the diverse ecological conditions in the Old Drava may be the key factors that enable the coexistence of the native crustaceans with invasive D. villosus in this part of the Drava river","Šarec, M.",,"Šarec, Marija, M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Drava R.,Dikerogammarus villosus,,,"invasive Amphipoda, expansion, influence",Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

PhD Thesis.

Much of this uncertainty results from intraspecific variation and convergence in morphological characters historically used for diagnosis of species and higher-level taxonomic groupings. The utility of Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic methods for analyses based on genetic data has been acknowledged by many systematic studies of decapods at a variety of taxonomic levels. This dissertation employed ML phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among hermit and king crabs at various levels of taxonomic sampling. The work is presented as a compilation of articles for future publication, the first of which focused on a subset of <i>Paguristes, Areopaguristes</i>, and  <i>Pseudopaguristes</i> species from the western Atlantic. That study demonstrated a lack of monophyly for all three genera and identified two new species previously suggested by  morphology. Further results confirmed that color is a key character for species diagnosis and  has potential to delineate broader taxonomic subgroups. Morphological descriptions for these  new species were provided in the second article of this volume, along with a comparative  discussion of potentially allied species. The final article in this volume expanded the number<i>Paguristes, Areopaguristes</i>, and <i>Pseudopaguristes</i> species in the phylogenetic analysis and included gene sequences for the type species of the three genera of primary interest were obtained, thereby enabling broader conclusions about the constituency of the genera. Major findings indicated numerous genetic clades within the generic complex, although the taxonomic scope and status of these clades was not definitively determined. Still, many of the clades recovered could be tentatively diagnosed by morphological characters that may prove useful for future taxonomic revisions. Based on such observations, it was suggested that <i>Paguristes</i> s.s. may be best represented by those taxa most closely allied with <i>A. hummi</i> and morphologically similar Pacific species such as <i>A. lemaitrei</i>, and <i>A. waldoschmitti</i>. The constituency and affiliation of <i>Areopaguristes</i> s.s. remained poorly defined, but phylogenetic outcomes suggested that <i>Pseudopaguriste</i> s.s. is composed of species with 8 quadriserial gill pairs and enlarged right chelipeds.

Collectively, camera trapping projects are generating a massive and continuous flow of data, consisting of images and videos (with and without animal observations) and associated identifications (Scotson et al. 2017, Kays et al. 2020). In recent years, significant progress has been made by the global camera trapping community to resolve the challenges this brings, from the development of specialized data management tools and analytical packages, to the application of cloud computing and artificial intelligence to automate species recognition (Tabak et al. 2018). However, to effectively exchange camera trap data between infrastructures and to (automatically) harmonize data into large-scale wildlife datasets, there is a need for a common data exchange format—one that captures the essential information about a camera trap study, allows expression of different study and identification approaches, and aligns well with existing biodiversity standards such as Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012). Here we present Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP), a data exchange format for camera trap data. It is managed by the Machine Observations Interest Group of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and developed publicly, soliciting community feedback for every change. Camtrap DP is built on Frictionless Standards, a set of generic specifications to describe and package (tabular) data and metadata. Camtrap DP extends these with specific requirements and constraints for camera trap data. By building on an existing framework, users can employ existing open source software to read and validate Camtrap DP formatted data. Validation especially is useful to automatically check if provided data meets the requirements set forth by Camtrap DP, before analysis or integration. Supported by the major camera trap data management systems e.g. Agouti, TRAPPER, eMammal, and Wildlife Insights, Camtrap DP is reaching its first stable version. The first Camtrap DP dataset was published on Zenodo (Cartuyvels et al. 2021b). This dataset was also published to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Cartuyvels et al. 2021a), demonstrating the ability and limitations of transforming the data to the Darwin Core standard.","Desmet, P.; Bubnicki, J.; Norton, B.",,"Bubnicki, Jakub, J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3897/biss.5.73188,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,"camera trap, data format",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, an extensive body of research focuses on the epidemiology and control of ASF. Nevertheless, little information is available on the combined effect of ASF and ASF-related control measures on wild boar (Sus scrofa) population abundances. This is crucial information given the role of the remaining wild boar that act as an important reservoir of the disease. Given the high potential of camera traps as a non-invasive method for ungulate trend estimation, we assess the effectiveness of ASF control measures using a camera trap network. In this study, we focus on a major ASF outbreak in 2018–2020 in the South of Belgium. This outbreak elicited a strong management response, both in terms of fencing off a large infected zone as well as an intensive culling regime. We apply a Bayesian multi-season site-occupancy model to wild boar detection/non-detection data. Our results show that (1) occupancy rates at the onset of our monitoring period reflect the ASF infection status; (2) ASF-induced mortality and culling efforts jointly lead to decreased occupancy over time; and (3) the estimated mean total extinction rate ranges between 22.44 and 91.35%, depending on the ASF infection status. Together, these results confirm the effectiveness of ASF control measures implemented in Wallonia (Belgium), which has regained its disease-free status in December 2020, as well as the usefulness of a camera trap network to monitor these effects.","Bollen, M.; Neyens, T.; Fajgenblat, M.; De Waele, V.; Licoppe, A.; Manet, B.; Casaer, J.; Beenaerts, N.",,"Beenaerts, Natalie, N.","Centre for Environmental Sciences, Hasselt University",https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.726117,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,,,,"African swine fever, camera traps, occupancy, spatio-temporal, Bayesian inference, Stan",Journal article,,,,,,,,,Hasselt University - Centre for Environmental Sciences (CMK),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The Mediterranean Sea hosts more than 3000 caves, which are among the most studied in the world. This review aims to synthesize and update knowledge of Mediterranean marine caves. Their biota includes few obligate cave-dwelling organisms, but many cryptobiotic or crevicular (crevice-dwelling) and bathyphilic (preferring deep-water) species that secondarily colonize caves. A total of 2369 taxa have been reported from 404 caves in 15 countries, with several species new to science described in recent decades. Dramatic environmental gradients generate a zonation of the biota, with up to six faunal zones and two main biocoenoses. Biotic cover and biomass are strongly reduced inside caves, due to hydrological confinement and trophic depletion. The food web is based on suspension-feeders, but motile carnivores play a role in the importation of organic matter from outside. Lack of primary production, faunal affinities and microbial metabolism make marine caves readily accessible models of deep ocean ecosystems. Future research should focus on filling regional (e.g. south-eastern Mediterranean) and thematic (e.g. microbes, meiofauna, macroinfauna) gaps in fundamental knowledge, and on management measures. Marine caves have low ecological resilience and harbour many species of conservation interest, but are threatened by seawater warming, local human impacts and non-indigenous species.","Gerovasileiou, V.; Bianchi, C.N.",,"Bianchi, Carlo Nike, C.N.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003138846-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,,"Biodiversity, ""Conservation""",,Marine Caves; Benthic Habitats,Book chapters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, WoRMS mainly focuses on taxonomy and does not specifically address species introductions. Here, we introduce the World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS), a database directly linked to WoRMS that includes all introduced marine species, distinguishing native and introduced geographic ranges. Both the WoRMS and  WRiMS contents are continually updated by specialists who add citations of original species descriptions, key taxonomic literature, images and notes on native and introduced geographic distributions. WRiMS editors take responsibility for assessing the validity of species records by critically evaluating if a species has been introduced to a region, erroneously identified and/or potentially naturally present in a region but previously unnoticed. WRiMS currently contains 2,714 introduced species. The amount and quality of the information entered depend on  the availability of experts to update its contents. Because WRiMS is global and it combines species taxonomic and geographic information with links to other resources and expertise, it is currently the most comprehensive standardised database of marine introduced species.

The number of macroalgal taxa has increased from 142 in 1994 to 207 in 2020 (an increase of 45.8%); rhodophytes increased from 74 to 110 (48.6%), chlorophytes from 45 to 61 (35.6%), and phaeophyceans from 23 to 36 (56.5%). Spatial and temporal trends in the IRL macroalgal community were analyzed from a data set collected contemporaneously (1994 – 1996; n ¼ 1,042 samples) with the Biodiversity Conference. The macroalgal community was primarily composed of unattached, ‘‘drift’’ algae, with the rhodophyte Gracilaria tikvahiae the most abundant species (59% of biomass). Macroalgal abundance increased,  with evidence of shifts in species composition, from north to south and no consistent temporal patterns. This study provides baseline data to determine long-term changes in community structure of IRL macroalgae and a call to address important research questions.","Hanisak, M.D.",,"Hanisak, M.

This distinct increase is based on a careful revision of museum material that was collected during the 19th century. A detailed revision revealed numerous misidentifications of published material, which greatly distorted the understanding of many species in the literature. The revised fauna reveals only minimal affinities with coeval faunas from the Proto-Mediterranean Sea and suggests a palaeogeographic subdivision within the Central Paratethys between northern and southern basins. A major drop in columbellid diversity occurred at the Langhian/Serravallian boundary, coinciding with the Miocene Climatic Transition. This event led to a severe diversity decline from a high Langhian level of 32 species, which was comparable in the number of columbellid species to that of the modern Red Sea and tropical West Africa (~23 species), down to a diversity level of nine species, equalling that of the modern Mediterranean Sea.","Harzhauser, M.; Landau, B.M.",,"Landau, Bernard, B.M.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.5025.1.1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Animalia, ""Columbellidae"", ""Gastropoda"", ""Mollusca"", ""Neogastropoda"", ""Plantae"", ""Tracheophyta""","Biodiversity, ""Taxonomy""",,"Magnoliopsida,  Annonaceae",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington: Friday Harbor. 14 pp.","The marine isopod Pentidotea wosnesenskii is one of many species that can change its color throughout its life. The variety of colors it can take on allows it to match the species of algae it lives on and consumes. While this isopod can change its color when moved to a new substrate, this requires it to build a new cuticle and molt, a process that takes weeks. It seems likely that it would be more efficient for an isopod to seek out algae that it is already matched to. This species is highly likely to have color sensing abilities as a way of adjusting their chromatophores, so they may use those abilities to search for a substrate that they can match. I placed isopods in containers where they had access to three different colors of algae. I hypothesized that adult isopods would show a preference for algae that was similar in color to their cuticles. However, the results of this study do not suggest that isopods use color sensing to move to matching backgrounds. Instead, they may be choosing substrates based on its quality as a food source or how well they can attach themselves to it. Because they can adjust the shade of their body with their chromatophores, these other factors may be a higher priority than a wellmatched color.","Nelson, A.",,"Nelson, Aurora, A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Pentidotea wosnesenskii,,,"marine isopod, color sensing, color sensing",Reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bergmann's rule posits that members of the same clade are larger at colder temperatures. Whether temperature drives this relationship is debated because several other potential drivers covary with temperature. We conducted a near-global comparative analysis on marine copepods (97 830 samples, 388 taxa) to test Bergmann's rule, considering other potential drivers. Supporting Bergmann's rule, we found temperature better predicted size than did latitude or oxygen, with body size decreasing by 43.9% across the temperature range (-1.7 to 30ºC). Body size also decreased by 26.9% across the range in food availability. Our results provide strong support for Bergman's rule in copepods, but emphasises the importance of other drivers in modifying this pattern.

These associations are involved in roles as diverse as nutrient exchanges, shelter or adaptation to adverse conditions. Ascidians are widely dispersed marine invertebrates associated to invasive behaviours. Studying their microbiomes has interested the scientific community, mainly due to its potential for bioactive compounds production—e.g., ET-73 (trabectedin, Yondelis), an anticancer drug. However, these symbiotic interactions embrace several environmental and biological functions with high ecological relevance, inspiring diverse biotechnological applications. We thoroughly reviewed microbiome studies (microscopic to metagenomic approaches) of around 171 hosts, worldwide dispersed, occurring at different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya), to illuminate the functions and bioactive potential of associated organisms in ascidians. Associations with Bacteria are the most prevalent, namely with Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes phyla. The microbiomes of ascidians belonging to Aplousobranchia order have been the most studied. The integration of worldwide studies characterizing ascidians’ microbiome composition revealed several functions including UV protection, bioaccumulation of heavy metals and defense against fouling or predators through production of natural products, chemical signals or competition. The critical assessment and characterization of these communities is extremely valuable to comprehend their biological/ecological role and biotechnological potential.","Matos, A.; Antunes, A.",,"Matos, Ana, A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md19070370,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,ascidians; symbiosis; bioactive potential,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to detailed light microscopic analysis, ultrastructural analysis of benthic diatoms from Lake Mrtvo More was performed for the first time using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A total of 97 taxa were identified in 12 samples. Cocconeis scutellum Ehrenberg and Halamphora coffeiformis (C.Agardh) Levkov were the most frequent taxa in the samples. Shannon-Wiener diver-sity index (H’) values varied from 1.78 (in September on Padina sp.) to 4.52 (in August on glass).

DNA metabarcoding of zooplankton enhances community-level analyses of connectivity in a marine pelagic environment. PhD Thesis. University of KwaZulu-Natal: Pietermaritzburg. 137 pp.","Zooplankton are abundant and diverse marine organisms that form ecologically important communities in marine pelagic ecosystems. They are well-suited for biomonitoring of ecosystem health and changes in biodiversity because their community structure and biomass respond rapidly to environmental variation. Biomonitoring of zooplankton communities using traditional morphology-based species identification methods is labor-intensive due to their cryptic morphology, high diversity and small body size. Fast-developing molecular techniques such as DNA metabarcoding (large-scale, high-throughput DNA sequencing of targeted gene regions to simultaneously identify multiple species present in samples) may provide higher resolution, accurate, faster and more cost-effective biomonitoring tools. The primary objectives of this dissertation were to develop and test a novel DNA metabarcoding approach for biomonitoring of marine zooplankton over the continental shelf of eastern South Africa. Novel taxon-specific DNA mini-barcode primers were designed to increase species identification rates of selected taxa. Artificially assembled mock communities with known composition and relative abundances were then used in an experimental setup to test detection rates and the accuracy of designed and published primers. The DNA metabarcoding protocol was then used to assess connectivity among zooplankton communities over the narrow KwaZulu-Natal continental shelf. Plankton tow nets were used to sample cross-shelf transects at three sites (uThukela, Durban and Aliwal), which are strongly influenced by the Agulhas Current but differ in shelf width, seafloor substrate and benthic habitat structures. Connectivity network analysis detected distinct clustering of zooplankton communities associated with each transect. The hypothesis that a dynamic ocean current regime associated with the offshore Agulhas Current (nearby and flowing parallel to the shelf-edge) would result in similar well-mixed alongshore zooplankton communities was rejected. A strong benthicpelagic coupling effect was inferred based on the species composition of planktonic larvae and benthic adults occurring at the respective transects. This dissertation provides a refined and novel method for biomonitoring of marine pelagic environments in coastal waters, based on taxonspecific DNA metabarcoding of zooplankton communities. The approach is well-suited to measuring the long-term effects of climate change on marine pelagic ecosystems and ocean productivity.","Govender, A.",,"Govender, Ashrenee, A.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,PhD,,,,,,,,,,,,

Explorations of deep-water ecosystems have been limited in this region, and elsewhere globally. To characterize community composition of mesophotic and deep-sea demersal fauna at seamounts in the region, we conducted expeditions to Rapa Nui (RN) and Salas y Gómez (SyG) islands in 2011 and Desventuradas Islands in 2013. Remote autonomous baited-cameras were used to conduct stationary video surveys between 150–1,850 m at RN/SyG (N = 20) and 75–2,363 m at Desventuradas (N = 27). Individual organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and relative abundance was quantified with the maximum number of individuals per frame. Deployments were attributed with associated environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, seamount age, and bathymetric position index [BPI]). We identified 55 unique invertebrate taxa and 66 unique fish taxa. Faunal community structure was highly dissimilar between and within subregions both for invertebrate (p &lt; 0.001) and fish taxa (p = 0.022). For fishes, dogfish sharks (Squalidae) accounted for the greatest dissimilarity between subregions (18.27%), with mean abundances of 2.26 ± 2.49 at Desventuradas, an order of magnitude greater than at RN/SyG (0.21 ± 0.54). Depth, seamount age, broad-scale BPI, and nitrate explained most of the variation in both invertebrate (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.475) and fish (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.419) assemblages. Slightly more than half the deployments at Desventuradas (N = 14) recorded vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa such as corals and sponges. Our study supports mounting evidence that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are areas of high biodiversity and high conservation value. While Chile and Peru have recently established or proposed marine protected areas in this region, the majority of these ridges lie outside of national jurisdictions and are under threat from overfishing, plastic pollution, climate change, and potential deep-sea mining. Given its intrinsic value, this region should be comprehensively protected using the best available conservation measures to ensure that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges remain a globally unique biodiversity hotspot.","Friedlander, A.M.; Goodell, W.; Giddens, J.; Easton, E.E.; Wagner, D.",,"Wagner, Daniel, D.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253213,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Seamounts; Invertebrates; Islands; Marine conservation; Marine ecosystems; Biodiversity; Marine fish; Nitrates,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, the aesthetic value of biodiversity is of strong importance as it contributes to human well-being and increases the collective willingness to engage in conservation efforts. Using the endangered coralligenous reefs along the French Mediterranean coastline as a case study, we propose a quantitative approach to estimate the aesthetic and ecological values of a marine ecosystem. We combined human image evaluation and deep learning algorithms to provide a quantitative estimation of the aesthetic value of 7692 photographic quadrats among 160 stations located between 20 and 90&nbsp;m depth and gathered on 95 sites. To understand how aesthetic value is related to biodiversity metrics, environmental variables and anthropogenic pressures we used a structural equation modelling approach. We found that taxonomic diversity and species composition explained a significant part of the aesthetic value of the coralligenous reefs. Taxonomic diversity showed a net positive effect and species composition analysis highlighted both positive and negative effects of some species on the aesthetic value. Net negative effects of functional and phylogenetic diversities were found, which illustrates an aesthetic bias in human perception of ecological value. The aesthetic and ecological values were mapped along the French Mediterranean coastline in three dimensions (longitude, latitude, depth); this synthetic visualization could be of strong interest for conservation and communication purposes about this endangered benthic key-ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea. Overall, our approach provides a geographically scalable estimate of the aesthetic value of biodiversity which is still an underestimated facet of nature contributions to people. It could be transposed to other marine ecosystems such as coral reefs but also to terrestrial landscapes for which an increasing number of images evaluated for human preference are becoming available.","Langlois, J.; Guilhaumon, F.; Bockel, T.; Boissery, P.; De Almeida Braga, C.; Deter, J.; Holon, F.; Marre, G.; Tribot, A.-S.; Mouquet, N.",,"Langlois, Juliette, J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107935,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Aesthetic perception; Coralligenous reefs; Ecological value; Deep learning; Nature contribution to people,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Construction of dichotomous taxonomic keys for San Francisco Bay planktonic diatoms. BSc Thesis. University of San Francisco: San Francisco. 39 + appendices pp.","Planktonic diatoms exhibit high biodiversity in marine systems and make a significant contribution to water column primary productivity. This makes research on planktonic diatoms particularly important in measuring the health of coastal marine ecosystems. At the University of San Francisco (USF), undergraduate research has been conducted since September 2015 to study planktonic diatoms in San Francisco Bay. A previous study by Keith (2018), Planktonic Diatom Species Succession in San Francisco Bay, documented changes in species diversity over time, observing seasonal patterns in species richness as well as the effect of environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, and rainfall on species succession. In her work, an abundance of centric diatoms was present, indicating their essential role in local phytoplankton communities; however, the majority of observed centric taxa could not be identified with light microscopy. The current project was intended to use scanning electron microscopy to examine phenotypic characteristics of cells from field collections of Keith (2018) and clonal cultures to identify the species that make up the assemblage of dominant centric diatoms. Five centric diatom species were identified prior to the COVID-19 pandemic: Coscinodiscus curvatulus, Actinoptychus senarius, Coscinodiscus oculus-iridis, Coscinodiscus lentiginosa, and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii. However, due to temporary sampling site closures and limited access to laboratories because of stay-at-home orders from the pandemic, the project was modified to be done remotely. The project was modified to analyze and compile present literature on diatom taxonomy based on morphology and develop taxonomic keys specific to diatoms in San Francisco Bay for use by both specialists and non-specialists, including school-aged children. In the construction of the keys, genera and species were considered significant if they were observed in ≥50% of the samples in the study by Keith (2018) from September 2015 - December 2017, including Chaetoceros spp., Ditylum brightwelli, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Rhizosolenia setigera, Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira spp., and Trieres mobiliensis. Here, two keys are constructed – “A Technical Key to Common Planktonic Diatoms in San Francisco Bay” and ""A Basic Key to Common Phytoplankton in San Francisco Bay” – and the challenges of constructing the keys are discussed.

However, very few pharmaceutical molecules have been isolated from this environment, yet very promising. Studies on secondary metabolites with pharmacological properties in gorgonians have been increasingly growing. Those molecules are made by a symbiosis between gorgonians and microorganisms. To extract it, some species can be overexploited in their natural environment on coral reefs. Pharmacological analyses have already been done on gorgonians of the genus Eunicella with the highlight of molecules such as terpenes and steroids, but no comparison have been made yet between different origins of those species. For this study, analyses to detect the presence of terpenes and steroids were made on the species Eunicella cavolini (Koch, 1887), Eunicella singularis (Esper, 1791) and Eunicella verrucosa (Pallas, 1766) coming from different locations: Aegean Sea, Corsica (Ligurian Sea), Roscoff (Celtic Sea) and Hendaye (Biscay Bay).

Several techniques were used to detect the presence of secondary metabolites: thin layer chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results highlighted the presence of terpenes and steroids in the gorgonians of the genus Eunicella. They are present in the same or even larger amount in the samples coming from the aquarium compared to the ones coming from the natural environment. Diversity and quantity is mainly influenced by the location: it’s the main characteristic coming out of this comparison. Temperature around 16°C seems to favor the development of the secondary metabolites. Between the three species studied, Eunicella verrucosa is likely to present the best results, though there are few correlations between the results of the same species. Depth, hydrodynamic conditions and anthropic conditions doesn’t seem to influence the diversity of the secondary metabolites produced. Gorgonians of the genus Eunicella are therefore marine organisms very promising for the development of pharmacological molecules in a culture environment.","Preud'homme, S.",,"Preud'homme, Sophie, S.","Université de Liège, Faculté des Sciences",,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using molluscs to assess ecological quality status of soft-bottom habitats along the Atlantic coastline of the United States. <i>Ecol.

Identifying the species needed for estimating these indices, however, is both expensive and time-consuming, and requires a high degree of taxonomic expertise. The use of proxy taxa as a means of subsampling the target community may save time, resources, and the breadth of taxonomic expertise needed. Our study used macroinvertebrate benthic survey data from the Atlantic Coast of the United States to test the fidelity of molluscs as proxies of the whole community. We calculated the AMBI and M-AMBI scores for both the molluscan and whole communities and then adjusted the molluscan-only index scores to that of the whole community using the linear relationship between the two communities within a Bayesian framework. We found that the mollusc-only AMBI approach underperformed at classifying the ecological quality of the whole community, particularly regarding sample sites classified as needing remediation. The low performance of the mollusc-only AMBI approach is likely due to the dearth of molluscs with high environmental stress tolerances. In contrast, the mollusc-only M-AMBI outperformed AMBI at classifying ecological quality. The M-AMBI linear model correctly classified nearly all of the adjusted mollusc-only sample sites needing remediation. The increased efficacy of mollusc-only M-AMBI may be due to the incorporation of species richness and diversity into the index, as both metrics were highly correlated between the molluscan and whole communities. Mollusc-only M-AMBI did have some drawbacks, however, with fidelity decreasing as ecological quality decreased. Overall, our study highlights the potential utility of a mollusc-only approach for assessing the ecological quality of estuarine and coastal soft-bottom habitats.","Pruden, M.J.; Dietl, G.P.; Handley, J.C.; Smith, J.A.",,"Pruden, Matthew, M.J.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107910,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,AMBI; M-AMBI; Proxy; Biotec index; Mollusc,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Texas A&M University: Texas. 33 pp.","Coral reefs are an essential part of the world. They provide the world with over half of the produced oxygen and take up over one-third of the carbon dioxide produced by mankind. Part of the success of these reef systems is due to the symbiotic relationship between coral and zooxanthellae (unicellular algae), and the different clades that reside within them. The relationship between these living organisms is essential for the reef systems survival, and for its ability to thrive. Zooxanthellae produce over 90% of the corals food and provide them with their vibrant color. The greatest threat to these delicate creatures is bleaching (loss of Zooxhantellae) due to increased water temperatures. Xenia elongata (Pulsing Xenia) is a soft coral that is easy to maintain in the laboratory, but also easy to bleach. In this project, I compared the concentration of zooxanthellae in Xenia, before and after a bleaching event induced by local temperature increase. The average loss of symbionts within these corals after bleaching was over 80%. This significant loss contributed to the mortality and complete disintegration of the observed colonies. The loss of zooxanthellae, resulted in coral starvation, that subsequently caused coral death. In this paper I also discuss how the increased temperatures may have caused an increased buildup of hydrogen peroxide which disrupted the extracellular matrix protein 67 and its calcium bonds. The loss of protein-calcium bond may then have caused the disintegration and overall death of the coral.","Scolley, J.F.",,"Scolley, James Franklin, J.F.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,BA,,,,,,,,,,,,

A field study on the effects of Norwegian aquaculture farms on the intertidal rocky shore community. MSc Thesis. The University of Bergen: Bergen. 105 pp.","The aquaculture industry has more than doubled since the early 2000s, and the growth is not predicted to stagnate any time soon. Norwegian salmonid aquaculture cages are usually open where waste is flushed from the cage by ocean currents, distributing nutrients and other compounds to the surrounding habitats. Nutrient enrichment can lead to eutrophication of the water masses, which again can have large ecological consequences on the habitat. This study examined if the intertidal communities around Bergen were affected by nearby aquaculture farms. This was done by examining data collected at rocky shores, and modeled values of change in dissolved inorganic nitrogen originating from aquaculture (Δ DIN) at each station retrieved from the NORWECOM model. In addition, three of the intertidal stations were resampled in summer to examine if there were differences in the results due to season. It was found that the intertidal animal community was influenced by Δ DIN, while the algae community was not. Biodiversity, species richness and functional group composition was not significantly driven by Δ DIN. The differences in station biodiversity, species richness, and functional group composition, were not significantly influenced by season, but the animal community, both during spring and summer, was influenced by Δ DIN, supporting my results from the main analysis. As grazing animals have been found to often preferer annual ephemeral algae, grazers have shown to aid as a tool for battling macroalgae blooms driven by nutrient enrichment. This could be the reason for the response in animal community, and not in algae community or biodiversity. More research is needed to figure out the ecological consequence of this change, but this study shows that the intertidal zone should be taken into consideration when deciding how the aquaculture industry should grow in the futur","Lynge, O.M.",,"Lynge, Ovidie Mari, O.M.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Universidad de Cádiz/Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research: Cádiz, Bremerhaven. 45 pp.","Reefs are ecologically valuable habitats in coastal oceans, acting as ground for settlement, feeding, nursery and shelter for numerous species. Around 80% of the reefs worldwide are threatened by human activities. The reefs of the North Sea are mostly of geological origin. In the German Bight the rocky reefs are protected by the European Union as part of the Natura 2000 Network. In this study, the Sylt Outer Reef, located in the south-eastern part of the North Sea, was described geologically and faunistically using digital videos from a towed underwater camera. A methodology was established to evaluate the distribution of seafloor substrata and to identify the reef fauna. Additionally, the fauna was quantified and the relationships between geological and faunistic variables were explored. A total of 11 video transects were analysed. At all stations, the benthic habitats were dominated by sandy sediment followed by lag deposit, while only small fractions of the seafloor were covered by stones. The sizes of the stones varied considerably within and between the stations with a maximum size of almost 60 cm. The benthic epifauna of the Sylt Outer Reef comprised 20 taxa (mostly species) from nine higher taxonomic groups. The Shannon-Wiener diversity of the epifauna varied between the stations from 0.69 to 2.01. The number of taxa at the stations depended on the habitat structure and declined with an increasing amount of the seafloor being covered by sand. Conversely, the number of taxa increased with stone size. Only the smallest stones were entirely uncolonized. In total, three different clusters of the epibenthic fauna could be distinguished inside the protected area of the Sylt Outer Reef. Although only a relatively small fraction of the benthic fauna can be captured by optical methods, the results generated by this noninvasive method allowed for a differentiated description of the epibenthic habitats of the reef areas of the Sylt Outer Reef.","Wagner Díaz-Marcote, I.",,"Wagner Díaz-Marcote, Irene, I.",,,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",North Sea,,"Benthos, ""Image analysis"", ""Reefs""",,Gutow,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,BSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can the well-studied environmental impacts of bathyal bottom trawling be used in assessing the unknown environmental effects of deep-sea mining on the abyssobenthic environment? MSc Thesis. University of Dundee: Dundee. 51 pp.","The deep-sea is the largest continuous ecosystem on Earth, yet it remains one of the least understood by scientists. Exploitation of the deep-sea takes several forms including commercial fishing and, in the near future, mining. Bottom trawling is a destructive, nonselective fishing method that is well established all over the world. Consequently, its environmental impacts have been well studied. Deep-sea mining (DSM), on the other hand, has not yet beguncommercially, but is expected to commence in both national and international waters within the next few decades. Since no large-scale seabed mining has yet taken place, its environmentalimpacts remain uncertain. This thesis explores the similarities of bathyal deep-sea bottom trawling (DSBT) and abyssal DSM to determine if the well-known environmental impacts of DSBT can be used to predict those of DSM. Methodologies are compared, as well as the biotic and faunal aspects of their respective benthic ecosystems. It is likely that the environmental effects of DSBT can andshould be used in assessing the impacts of DSM. Because full-scale in situ testing remains challenging and expensive for submarine mining, this insight may prove helpful in establishing preliminary regulations and environmental protections for DSM.","Geiser, L.",,"Geiser, Lauren, L.",,,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,,Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MSc,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim is to detect anomalies in order to correct them and assign a quality level (""Good"", ""Doubtful"", ""False"") providing users with a confidence level thus a relevance in using those data. However, no such procedure existed for the quality control of taxonomic data, especially for geographic and taxonomic information. In order to overcome this lack, the work I carried out led to a procedure for biogeographical control of taxonomic data. Relevant tests have been identified, and scripts were developed to perform these tests on a selected dataset (phytoplankton from the REPHY network from 2010 to 2020). Results have been used to develop descriptive sheets allowing to run the tests on demand. Some tests have been integrated into existing tools and the result has been ordered and documented to provide the expected qualification procedure.","Bonnet, S.",,"Bonnet, Sarah, S.",,,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,"data quality, procedure, taxonomic data, database, Quadrige",Book/Monograph,Dissertation,MA,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is highly probable that the fortified residence belonged to the elite who controlled the surrounding territory. The objective of the work is to supplement the information obtained from the rest of the archaeological mate-rial with data on the contemporary malacological fauna in the settlement, since much of it shows signs of having suffered from the fire that affected the building. The material was obtained in the excavation campaigns of 2016 and 2018 and was found in the same stratigra-phic level. The shells of 5 species of marine and 4 continental molluscs were found within the building.Marine molluscs were intentionally collected from the thanatacoenoses of a gravel beach and transported to the fortified residence. Given that the shells had marine encrustations within them, showed obvious signs of having been dragged and eroded through wave action and had perforations caused by marine predators, it is clear that they were empty when collected and could not have been used as a food source. It must therefore be assumed that there was some other reason, maybe recreational, for their collection.With regards to the continental molluscs, there is no data showing that they were collected intentionally. The presence of some burned specimens could be interpreted as showing that they were contemporary with the fire or buried naturally soon afterwards. The ecological characteristics of the four species allows us to infer that the appearance and vegetation of that time was very similar to the current one (Mediterranean scrub) and that therefore some clearing of the original forests, probably through the use of burning, had already taken place and that could have occurred quite some time prior to the construction of the building.","Forner, E.; Oliver, A.; Falomir, F.; Gual, V.",,"Forner, Enric, E.",,,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,"archaeomalacology, Iron Age, Iberian culture, Vinaròs",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fundamental prerequisite for monitoring and explaining their geographical distribution is precise descriptions of their morphology. Four new, closely related species of the family Paramesochridae (Copepoda, Harpacticoida) were found in the deep sea of the Pacific (San Diego Trough and off Chile), the Atlantic Ocean (Porcupine Abyssal Plain and Angola Basin), and the Atlantic and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea and off Crozet Island). The discovery of <em>Emertonia berndi</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong>, <em>E. hessleri</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong>, <em>E. ilse</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong>, and<em> E. serrata</em> <strong>sp. nov.</strong> increases the number of known deep-sea species in this genus to ten. The new species are placed in <em>Emertonia</em> Wilson, 1932 because of their one-segmented endopods on the second and third swimming legs. The presence of a two-segmented endopod on the fourth swimming leg allocates them to the “<em>andeep</em>-group” within this genus. The four species can be distinguished from their congeners by the strongly serrated spines on the exopods of their swimming legs and an outwardly directed flexible seta on the exopod of the fifth leg. It is conveivable that these two specific characters evolved only once in the genus <em>Emertonia</em>. Their apparently cosmopolitan distribution covers thousands of kilometres and spans all major oceans. This biogeographical pattern may be explained by resuspension events followed by passive transport by benthic currents. Discrepancies in their dispersal ranges may be a result of changing geological and oceanographic boundaries.","Mathiske, A.; Thistle, D.; Gheerardyn, H.; Veit-Köhler, G.",,"Veit-Köhler, Gritta, G.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.5051.1.18,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,"Copepoda, ""Crustacea"", ""Kliopsyllus"", ""Paramesochridae""",,,"Crustacea, distribution range, Kliopsyllus, meiobenthic copepods, Paramesochridae, species description, systematics, DIVA-1, PUCK, SYSTCO, D.S.V.

Here we describe the Muar Oyster, <i>Crassostrea (Magallana) saidii</i> sp. nov., first reported as an established local fishery renowned for exceptional and distinctive flavour over 160 years ago by British colonial officials in Malaysia, but as yet never formally named or described as a species. This new species has a subtle but clear morphological diagnosis dependent on three-dimensional characters, which has long been recognised by local fishers to differentiate the new species from co-occurring <i>C. (M.) belcheri</i> (G. B. Sowerby II, 1871). The Indo-Pacific clade <i>Magallana</i> Salvi & Mariottini, 2016 in Salvi and Mariottini 2017 is a phylogenetically distinct group that nonetheless cannot be morphologically separated from the broader genus <i>Crassostrea</i> Sacco, 1897. Fossils or species known only from shell specimens, though morphologically distinct species, cannot be classified as <i>Magallana, Talonostrea</i> Li & Qi, 1994, or <i>Crassostrea s.s.</i>; therefore, we revise these groups as sub-genera within <i>Crassostrea</i>. Our analysis of the COI barcoding fragment from previously published sequences of all available Magallana species found that gene is not sufficient to separate several economically important species, and revealed more than 5% of sequences in GenBank represent identification errors. The new species <i>Crassostrea (Magallana) saidii</i> sp. nov., which is genetically, morphologically, and gastronomically distinct, is known from only one population under potential threat from urbanisation. Many more global species of <i>Magallana</i> remain undescribed. The systematics of this group is critical to understand the diversity of global oysters, and to understand the sustainable use of species grown worldwide for centuries as our food.","Sigwart, J.D.; Wong, N.L.W.S.; Esa, Y.",,"Wong, Nur Leena, N.L.W.S.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12526-021-01203-x,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,Crassostreinae,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral geography and local environment of reefs in the subtropical South Pacific likely promotes the allopatric and adaptive divergence of taxa colonising from the tropics; however, the fauna of this region has been relatively understudied. Here, we address the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships among <i>Chrysiptera</i> taxa of the subtropical South Pacific. We use meristic counts, morphometrics and genetic markers to characterise the similarities and differences among four taxa restricted to the South Pacific region that have strikingly different colouration: <i>C. notialis,</i> a taxon restricted to eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island; <i>C. galba,</i> found in the Cook Islands, southern French Polynesia and Pitcairn Islands; and the two disjunct populations of <i>C. rapanui,</i> found in the eastern Pacific around Rapa Nui (Isla de Pascua or Easter Island) and Motu Motiro Hiva (Salas y Gómez) and in the South-western Pacific around Rangitāhua (Kermadec Islands). Our morphometric analysis confirmed that these four taxa, including the two disjunct populations of <i>C. rapanui</i>, are morphologically distinct. However, our genetic analysis revealed that only <i>C. rapanui</i> from Rapa Nui was genetically differentiated, whereas <i>C. rapanui</i> of Rangitāhua, <i>C. galba</i> and <i>C. notialis</i> all shared a common haplotype. Furthermore, none of the taxa could be consistently differentiated based on individual meristic features. Our study reconciles a formerly perplexing and disjunct distribution for <i>C. rapanui</i>, to reveal that <i>C. rapanui</i> is an endemic of Rapa Nui and that the <i>Chrysiptera</i> of French Polynesia, Rangitāhua, and the South-western Pacific have only a very recent history of divergence. Our analyses suggest these subtropical taxa have diverged from a predominantly tropical <i>Chrysiptera</i> genus in morphological features important in determining colonisation success, locomotion and feeding ecology.","Liggins, L.; Kilduff, L.; Trnski, T.; Delrieu-Trottin, E.; Carvajal, J.I.; Arranz, V.; Planes, S.; Saenz-Agudelo, P.; Aguirre, J.D.",,"Liggins, Libby, L.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-021-02179-7,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An expedition on marine biodiversity monitoring of Saint Martin’s Island through underwater visual census method was carried out from December 2017 to March 2018. In this study, a total of 25 scleractinian coral species of 8 families and 14 genera were identified, of which 12 species, Dipsastraea lizardensis, Dipsastraea maritima, Dipsastraea veroni, Favites acuticollis, Favites melicerum, Favites pentagona, Goniastrea stelligera, Goniopora albiconus, Goniopora norfolkensis, Pavona clavus, Plesiastrea versipora, and Psammocora exesa were recorded for the first time in Bangladeshi marine water. These new records exemplify gaps in sampling and recording of coral species in Bangladesh, and suggest the need of extensive research on coral ecosystem in the country. Assessment of different valid reports and publications including the present study revealed that a total of 98 species of hard corals of 18 families and 37 genera have been reported until now in Saint Martin’s Island as well as Bangladesh.","Habib, K.A.; Islam, M.J.",,"Habib, Kazi, K.A.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjz.v49i1.53678,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,"The Bay of Bengal, Hard Coral, First Report, Saint Martin’s Island",Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two major taxonomically diverse and trophically important gelatinous zooplankton groups that have, however, stayed largely understudied until now are the cnidarian jellyfish and ctenophores. This data scarcity is predominantly due to many of these fragile, soft-bodied organisms being easily fragmented and/or destroyed with traditional net sampling methods. Progress in alternative survey methods including, for instance, optics-based methods is slowly starting to overcome these obstacles. As video annotation by human observers is both time-consuming and financially costly, machine-learning techniques should be developed for the analysis of <i>in situ</i> /<i>in aqua</i> image-based datasets. This requires taxonomically accurate training sets for correct species identification and the present paper is the first to provide such data.</p>              </div>            </div>            <div class=""P-Article-Preview-Block"">              <h2 id=""new_information"" class=""unselectable"">New information</h2>              <div class=""P-Article-Preview-Block-Content"" field_id=""502"" commentable=""true"">                <p>In this study, we twice conducted three week-long <i>in situ</i> optics-based surveys of jellyfish and ctenophores found under the ice in the McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.

Despite the small geographic and temporal scales of our study, we provided new undescribed morphological traits for all observed gelatinous zooplankton species (eight cnidarian and four ctenophore species). Three ctenophores and one leptomedusa likely represent undescribed species.

The family Loliginidae Lesueur, 1821 has historically been recognized for having taxonomic problems due to the lack of robust descriptors. Thus, in this study, we aimed at evaluating beak shape as a taxonomic character for <i>Doryteuthis opalescens</i> (Berry, 1911), <i>Lolliguncula diomedeae</i> (Hoyle, 1904), and <i>Lolliguncula panamensis</i> Berry, 1911 via geometric morphometrics. In addition, a thorough morphological description and an identification key were developed for upper and lower beaks of the three loliginid squid species. Our results indicated strong taxon differentiation based on beak shape, especially upper beaks, although both (upper and lower beaks) structures exhibited a strong discriminant power at the species level. The species-specific beak shape could be the result of differences in both feeding habits and habitat, possibly since the origin of the species due to the higher beak shape similarity between congeners. The beak shape description and taxonomic key are a reliable identification source for the three loliginid squid species. These materials are now available for users, especially those interested in determining the feeding ecology of predators when whole squid individuals are not available.","Pacheco-Ovando, R.; Granados-Amores, J.; González-Salinas, B.; Ruiz-Villegas, J.M.; Díaz-Santana-Iturrios, M.",,"Pacheco-Ovando, Renata, R.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12526-021-01220-w,,WoRMS ackn - direct reference,,,,,,Journal article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The order level is mandatory in Linnaean rank-based classification and is also required in many internet-based biodiversity databases. However, it has received little attention in oligochaete systematics, and the few available order-level classifications of Oligochaeta no longer represent phylogenetic relationships adequately. Our proposal is based on corroborated molecular phylogenetic evidence and takes as benchmarks class level for Clitellata, subclass level for Oligochaeta and Hirudinea, and order level for Crassiclitellata, the monophylum that includes most of the earthworm taxa. As a result, eleven orders are proposed: Alluroidida Timm & Martin, 2015; Capilloventrida Timm, n. ordo; Crassiclitellata Jamieson, 1988; Enchytraeida Kasprzak, 1984; Haplotaxida Brinkhurst & Jamieson, 1971; Lumbriculida Brinkhurst & Jamieson, 1971; Moniligastrida Brinkhurst & Jamieson, 1971; Narapida Timm, n. ordo; Parvidrilida Timm, n. ordo; Randiellida Jamieson, 1988; Tubificida Jamieson, 1978.
