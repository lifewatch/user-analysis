An introductory overview of the four classes of the Porifera is followed by a description of the structure of our main source of data for this paper, the WPD. From this we extracted numbers of all ‘known’ sponges to date: the number of valid Recent sponges is established at 8,553, with the vast majority, 83%, belonging to the class Demospongiae. We also mapped for the first time the species richness of a comprehensive set of marine ecoregions of the world, data also extracted from the WPD. Perhaps not surprisingly, these distributions appear to show a strong bias towards collection and taxonomy efforts. Only when species richness is accumulated into large marine realms does a pattern emerge that is also recognized in many other marine animal groups: high numbers in tropical regions, lesser numbers in the colder parts of the world oceans. Preliminary similarity analysis of a matrix of species and marine ecoregions extracted from the WPD failed to yield a consistent hierarchical pattern of ecoregions into marine provinces. Global sponge diversity information is mostly generated in regional projects and resources: results obtained demonstrate that regional approaches to analytical biogeography are at present more likely to achieve insights into the biogeographic history of sponges than a global perspective, which appears currently too ambitious. We also review information on invasive sponges that might well have some influence on distribution patterns of the future.","Van Soest, R.W.M.; Boury-Esnault, N.; Vacelet, J.; Dohrmann, M.; Erpenbeck, D.; de Voogd, N.J.; Santodomingo, N.; Vanhoorne, B.; Kelly, M.; Hooper, J.N.A.",WOS:000305336000024,"Vanhoorne, Bart, B.",Flanders Marine Institute-VLIZ,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035105,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Porifera,"Biodiversity, ""Databases"", ""Taxonomy""",,,"Netherlands Ctr Biodivers Naturalis, Leiden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,,NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC; CALCAREOUS SPONGES; ASBESTOPLUMA-HYPOGEA; PHYLOGENETIC-SIGNAL; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; GLASS SPONGE; DEMOSPONGIAE; EVOLUTION; REEF,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

We show that overall, seabirds are more threatened than other comparable groups of birds and that their status has deteriorated faster over recent decades. The principal current threats at sea are posed by commercial fisheries (through competition and mortality on fishing gear) and pollution, whereas on land, alien invasive predators, habitat degradation and human disturbance are the main threats. Direct exploitation remains a problem for some species both at sea and ashore. The priority actions needed involve: a) formal and effective site protection, especially for Important Bird Area (IBA) breeding sites and for marine IBA feeding and aggregation sites, as part of national, regional and global networks of Marine Protected Areas; b) removal of invasive, especially predatory, alien species (a list of priority sites is provided), as part of habitat and species recovery initiatives; and c) reduction of bycatch to negligible levels, as part of comprehensive implementation of ecosystem approaches to fisheries. The main knowledge gaps and research priorities relate to the three topics above but new work is needed on impacts of aquaculture, energy generation operations and climate change (especially effects on the distribution of prey species and rise in sea level).

Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (<em>sensu</em> Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, <em>Pecten maximus</em> and <em>Glycymeris glycymeris</em>, and two ecologically important species, <em>Abra alba</em> and <em>Ophelia borealis</em> were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050–2059 and 2090–2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for <em>A.</em> <em>alba</em>. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future. The displacement and colonisation success of species are a function of many other non-climatic factors such as species life histories, dispersal abilities, adaptability and community interactions.","Rombouts, I.; Beaugrand, G.; Dauvin, J.C.",WOS:000302448300015,"Rombouts, Isabelle, I.","Univ Sci Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, UMR CNRS LOG 8187, F-62930 Wimereux, France.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.12.026,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",English Channel,,"Climatic changes, ""Ecological niches"", ""Modelling""",,Benthic macrofauna,"Univ Sci Technol Lille Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, UMR CNRS LOG 8187, 28 Ave Foch, F-62930 Wimereux, France.",France,benthic macrofauna; English Channel; ecological niche; Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche; model; climate change scenarios; CHARM,HABITAT-SUITABILITY; SAMPLE-SIZE; MODELS; NICHE; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; ENVELOPE; IMPACTS; BRITAIN; AREA,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Joint Research Unit: Laboratory for Oceanology and Geosciences (LOG) (UMR 8187),,France,,Research network,Science

Defining habitat characteristics influencing the distribution, density and growth of plaice (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>) and dab (<i>Limanda limanda</i>) on west of Ireland nursery grounds. PhD Thesis. Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology: Galway.  178 pp.","Plaice (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>, L.) and dab (<i>Limanda limanda</i>, L.) are among the most abundant flatfishes in the north-eastern Atlantic region and the dominant species in shallow coastal nursery grounds. With increasing pressures on commercial flatfish stocks in combination with changing coastal environments, better knowledge of population dynamics during all life stages is needed to evaluate variability in year-class strength and recruitment to the fishery. The aim of this research was to investigate the complex interplay of biotic and abiotic habitat components influencing the distribution, density and growth of plaice and dab during the vulnerable juvenile life stage and to gain insight in spatial and temporal differences in nursery habitat quality along the west coast of Ireland. Intraspecific variability in plaice diet was observed at different spatial scales and showed a link with condition, recent growth and morphology. This highlights the effect of food availability on habitat quality and the need to consider small scale variation when attempting to link habitat quality to feeding, growth and condition of juvenile flatfish. There was evidence of trophic, spatial and temporal resource partitioning between juvenile plaice and dab allowing the co-existence of morphologically similar species in nursery grounds. In the limited survey years there was no evidence that the carrying capacity of the studied nursery grounds was reached but spatial and interannual variations in fish growth indicated fluctuating environments in terms of food availability, predator densities, sediment features and physico-chemical conditions. Predation was the most important factor affecting habitat quality for juvenile plaice and dab with crab densities negatively correlated to fish condition whereas shrimp densities were negatively associated with densities of small-sized juveniles in spring. A comparison of proxies for fish growth showed the advantage of Fulton’s <i>K</i> for routine use whereas RNA:DNA ratios proved less powerful when short-term environmental fluctuations are lacking. This study illustrated how distinct sets of habitat features can drive spatial variation in density and condition of juvenile flatfish highlighting the value of studying both variables when modeling habitat requirements. The habitat models generated in this study also provide a powerful tool to predict potential climate and anthropogenic impacts on the distribution and condition of juveniles in flatfish nurseries. The need for effective coastal zone management was emphasized to ensure a sustainable use of coastal resources and successful flatfish recruitment to the fishery.

The polychaetes represent a conspicuous component of benthic communities in Canadian marine waters, yet information on species diversity and distribution is available only at the local scale. This study compiles polychaete species records from Canada over the last 150 years to assess broad-scale patterns of species richness, beta diversity (partitioned into turnover and nestedness), and species distributions in the surrounding Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans. Records indicate the presence of 1200 species belonging to 68 families, while statistical extrapolation estimated a total of 1629 species. Pacific waters have the highest richness with 791 recorded species. The eastern and western regions of the Arctic Ocean have the highest faunal similarity, but the fewest endemic species, reflecting the recent ice-free status of this basin. Species turnover is highest between Pacific and Atlantic basins, decreases with geographic proximity, and is lowest in comparisons with Hudson Bay. Similar patterns of turnover between temperate and (sub)Arctic basins suggest that both Atlantic and Pacific faunas played an important role in Arctic recolonization following deglaciation. Despite the vast geographic area, nearly 13% of species are reported in all three oceans; however, many of these taxa likely represent species complexes. These results highlight the need for more detailed examination of many species with broad distributions and suggest that diversity in Canada is currently underestimated.","Carr, C.M.",WOS:000304098000002,"Carr, Christina, C.M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-011-0095-y,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Canada,Polychaeta,"Biogeography, ""Species diversity""",,Species checklist,"Univ Guelph, Biodivers Inst Ontario, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",Canada,Polychaetes; Canada; Species diversity; Biogeography; Species checklist,BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES COMPLEX; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; NORTH-AMERICA; BIODIVERSITY; REVISION; ANNELIDA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; SEA; PHYLLODOCIDAE,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Guelph - Biodiversity Institute of Ontario,x,Canada,,Research institute,Science

However, the spatial extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental, before–after and inside–outside (control-impacted), situations for assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand’s oldest marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30 years previously. Areas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock) lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks, increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when invasive species reach the reserve. No-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for ecosystems.

We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discoveredResults: There are ~226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (~20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ~170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science.Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.","Appeltans, W.; Ahyong, S.T.; Anderson, G.; Angel, M.V.; Artois, T.; Bailly, N.; Bamber, R.N.; Barber, A.; Bartsch, I.; Berta, A.; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz , M.; Bock, P.; Boxshall, G.; Boyko, C.B.; Nunes Brandão, S.; Bray, R.A.; Bruce, N.L.; Cairns, S.D.; Chan, T.-Y.; Cheng, L.; Collins, A.G.; Cribb, T.H.; Curini-Galletti, M.; Dahdouh-Guebas, F.; Davie, P.J.F.; Dawson, M.N.; De Clerck, O.; Decock, W.; De Grave, S.; de Voogd, N.J.; Domning, D.P.; Emig, C.C.; Erséus, Ch.; Eschmeyer, W.; Fauchald, K.; Fautin, D.G.; Feist, S.W.; Fransen, C.H.J.M.; Furuya, H.; García-Alvarez, O.; Gerken, S.; Gibson, D.; Gittenberger, A.; Gofas, S.; Gómez-Daglio, L.; Gordon, D.P.; Guiry, M.D.; Hernandez, F.; Hoeksema, B.W.; Hopcroft, R.R.; Jaume, D.; Kirk, P.; Koedam, N.; Koenemann, S.; Kolb, J.B.; Kristensen, R.M.; Kroh, A.; Lambert, G.; Lazarus, D.B.; Lemaitre, R.; Longshaw, M.; Lowry, J.; MacPherson, E.; Madin, L.P.; Mah, C.; Mapstone, G.; McLaughlin, P.A.; Mees, J.; Meland, K.; Messing, C.G.; Mills, C.E.; Molodtsova, T.N.; Mooi, R.; Neuhaus, B.; Ng, P.K.L.; Nielsen, C.; Norenburg, J.; Opresko, D.M.; Osawa, M.; Paulay, G.; Perrin, W.; Pilger, J.F.; Poore, G.C.B.; Pugh, Ph.R.; Read, G.B.; Reimer, J.D.; Rius, M.; Rocha, R.M.; Sáiz Salinas, J.I.; Scarabino, V.; Schierwater, B.; Schmidt-Rhaesa, A.; Schnabel, K.E.; Schotte, M.; Schuchert, P.; Schwabe, E.; Segers, H.; Self-Sullivan, C.; Shenkar, N.; Siegel, V.; Sterrer, W.; Stöhr, S.; Swalla, B.; Tasker, M.L.; Thuesen, E.V.; Timm, T.; Todaro, M.A.; Turon, X.; Tyler, S.; Uetz, P.; van der Land, J.; Vanhoorne, B.; van Ofwegen, L.P.; Van Soest, R.W.M.; Vanaverbeke, J.; Walker-Smith, G.K.; Walter, T.C.; Warren, A.; Williams, G.C.; Wilson, S.P.; Costello, M.J.",WOS:000312115300015,"Costello, Mark, M.J.",,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.036,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Global,,Species diversity,,,"Flanders Marine Inst, Flemish Marine Data & Informat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Belgium,,RICHNESS; FUTURE; BIODIVERSITY; TAXONOMY; RATES,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute,x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The OBIS data system now contains 31.3 million observations, freely accessible through a geospatial portal. The challenges of storing, querying, disseminating, and mapping a global data collection of this complexity and magnitude are significant. In the face of declining performance and expanding feature requests, a redevelopment of the OBIS data system was undertaken. Following an Open Source philosophy, the OBIS technology stack was rebuilt using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer and OpenLayers. This approach has markedly improved the performance and online user experience while maintaining a standards-compliant and interoperable framework. Due to the distributed nature of the project and increasing needs for storage, scalability and deployment flexibility, the entire hardware and software stack was built on a Cloud Computing environment. The flexibility of the platform, combined with the power of the application stack, enabled rapid re-development of the OBIS infrastructure, and ensured complete standards-compliance.","Fujioka, E.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Donnelly, B.; Castillo, J.; Cleary, J.; Holmes, C.; McKnight, S.; Halpin, P.",WOS:000302798300005,"Vanden Berghe, Edward, E.","Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2012.01310.x,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,"Data collections, ""Data systems""",,,"Duke Univ, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Nicholas Sch, LSRC A328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",USA,,OBIS-SEAMAP; BIODIVERSITY; INFORMATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; WORLD,Geography,Geography,,,,,,

Comparable compilations of biological data are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these patterns, but have received far less attention. We assess the availability of biological data across an entire assemblage: the well-documented demersal marine fauna of the United Kingdom. We also test whether data availability for a species depends on its taxonomic group, maximum body size, the number of times it has been recorded in a global biogeographic database, or its commercial and conservation importance.  Location Seas of the United Kingdom.  Methods We defined a demersal marine fauna of 973 species from 15 phyla and 40 classes using five extensive surveys around the British Isles. We then quantified the availability of data on eight key biological traits (termed biological knowledge) for each species from online databases. Relationships between biological knowledge and our predictors were tested with generalized linear models.  Results Full data on eight fundamental biological traits exist for only 9% (<i>n</i> = 88) of the UK demersal marine fauna, and 20% of species completely lack data. Clear trends in our knowledge exist: fish (median biological knowledge score = six traits) are much better known than invertebrates (one trait). Biological knowledge increases with biogeographic knowledge and (to a lesser extent) with body size, and is greater in species that are commercially exploited or of conservation concern.  Main conclusions Our analysis reveals deep ignorance of the basic biology of a well-studied fauna, highlighting the need for far greater efforts to compile biological trait data. Clear biases in our knowledge, relating to how well sampled or ‘important’ species are suggests that caution is required in extrapolating small subsets of biologically well-known species to ecosystem-level studies.","Tyler, E.H.M.; Somerfield, P.J.; Vanden Berghe, E.; Bremmer, J.; Jackson, E.; Langmead, O.; Palomares, M.L.D.; Webb, T.J.",WOS:000307897200005,"Somerfield, P.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00726.x,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",United Kingdom,,"Biodiversity, ""Demersal fisheries"", ""Ecosystems"", ""Missing data""",,Benthic invertebrates; Biological traits analysis; Demersal fishes: Ecosystem function; Functional traits; Marine biodiversity; Marine macroecology,"Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",England,Benthic invertebrates; biological traits analysis; demersal fishes; ecosystem function; functional traits; marine biodiversity; marine macroecology; missing data; United Kingdom,ABUNDANCE-OCCUPANCY RELATIONSHIPS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; EXTINCTION RISK; SPECIES TRAITS; FRESH-WATER; MARINE; ECOLOGY; CONSERVATION; DYNAMICS; MODELS,"Ecology; Geography, Physical",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,University of Sheffield - Department of Animal & Plant Sciences,x,UK,,University,Science

Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how WoRMS publishes online quality assured information on marine species.Within WoRMS, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management.By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of WoRMS, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management.","Costello, M.J.; Bouchet, P.; Boxshall, G.; Fauchald, K.; Gordon, D.; Hoeksema, B.W.; Poore, G.C.B.; Van Soest, R.W.M.; Stöhr, S.; Walter, T.C.; Vanhoorne, B.; Decock, W.; Appeltans, W.",WOS:000313551500006,"Appeltans, Ward, W.","Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, IOC Project Office for IODE",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0051629,,"European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged, ""Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Biodiversity, ""Databases"", ""Standardization"", ""Taxonomy""",,,"Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",New Zealand,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; TAXONOMY; COLLECTIONS; INFORMATION; CONSERVATION; PUBLICATION; RICHNESS; IMPACT; OCEAN; RATES,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,

The effects of temperature on performance traits (i.e., growth and photosynthesis) and temperature tolerance ranges (i.e., survival) have been experimentally determined for a wide variety of seaweed species and explain large-scale biogeographic distribution patterns. In contrast, studies on temperature effects on cellular components (i.e., proteins and membranes) and environmentally induced changes in transcriptional processes still remain scarce. One major obstacle has been the lack of genomic information of seaweed species, which is now increasing. Furthermore, sophisticated ecological niche models have been applied in the recent years to predict geographical areas with suitable environmental conditions for marine seaweed species.","Eggert, A.",,"Eggert, Anja, A.",,,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,"Acclimation, ""Adaptations"", ""Environmental conditions"", ""Growth"", ""Temperature effects"", ""Tolerance""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiscale variability of amphipod assemblages in <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadows: a comparison between different protection levels. PhD Thesis. Laboratory of Oceanology. University of Liège: Liège.  ","Despite the rapid expansion of marine protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea, very few studies have addressed macrozoobenthos responses to protection. The aim of this work was to assess and better understand the potential responses of amphipod assemblages in Posidonia oceanica meadows between different protection levels. Two approaches were used. First, multiscale variability patterns of amphipod assemblages were investigated at the Revellata Bay (France) and the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (TMP A, Italy), over spatial scales spanning five orders of magnitude (-1 m to >100s of km) for two consecutive years. Second, the role of fish predation in affecting amphipod assemblages was evaluated using experimental manipulations of predation intensity. Amphipod assemblages of P. oceanica meadows were typified by high density and number of species. Our research revealed that amphipod natural variability was great at small and large scales in P. oceanica meadows. At small scales (from -1 m to -10 m), this pattern was in relation to both total amphipod density and/ or several species densities, which may be explained by behavioural traits of amphipods. At large scale (>100 km), the structure of amphipod assemblages was different between meadows and may be related to hydrodynamic forces. During this research, a new caprellid, Caprella tavolarensis was discovered and described. The species is close to Caprella liparotensis, but can be clearly distinguished by smaller size, presence of a short rostrum, body elongate and dorsally smooth, absence of serrate carina on the basis of gnathopod 2 and pereopods, mouthparts scarcely setose, absence of fine setae on peduncle of antenna 1 and absence of swimming setae on antenna 2. At the 1MP A, the structure of amphipod assemblages differed markedly among protection levels. Moreover, it was observed lower densities and/ or biomasses of several frequent taxa within the fully protected area and outside the MPA compared to partially protected areas. Meadow features account only for a low proportion of the amphipod variability, while predation by fish seemed to be an important factor in structuring P. oceanica amphipod populations. Overall, this work suggests that full protection at the 1MP A is likely to contribute partially (primarily via fish predation) to the observed variability patterns among zones. However, superimposed factors including behavioural traits of amphipod species and surrounding habitats are likely to be also significant. Whether these changes are representative of all fully protected areas and whether those effects are positive or negative to the meadows, are still unknown.

Alternatively, pantropical distributions challenge the belief of limited intrinsic dispersal capacity of marine seaweeds and the effectiveness of the north-south oriented continents as dispersal barriers. We aimed to re-assess the distribution of two allegedly circumtropical brown algae, Dictyota ciliolata and D. crenulata, and interpret the realized geographical range of the respective species in relation to their thermal tolerance and major tectonic and climatic events during the Cenozoic.    Methodology/Principal Findings    Species delimitation was based on 184 chloroplast encoded psbA sequences, using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by analyzing a six-gene dataset. Divergence times were estimated using relaxed molecular clock methods and published calibration data. Distribution ranges of the species were inferred from DNA-confirmed records, complemented with credible literature data and herbarium vouchers. Temperature tolerances of the species were determined by correlating distribution records with local SST values. We found considerable conflict between traditional and DNA-based species definitions. Dictyota crenulata consists of several pseudocryptic species, which have restricted distributions in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Central America. In contrast, the pantropical distribution of D. ciliolata is confirmed and linked to its significantly wider temperature tolerance.    Conclusions/Significance    Tectonically driven rearrangements of physical barriers left an unequivocal imprint on the current diversity patterns of marine macroalgae, as witnessed by the D. crenulata–complex. The nearly circumglobal tropical distribution of D. ciliolata, however, demonstrates that the north-south oriented continents do not present absolute dispersal barriers for species characterized by wide temperature tolerances.","Tronholm, A.; Leliaert, F.; Sansón, M.; Afonso-Carrillo, J.; Tyberghein, L.; Verbruggen, H.; De Clerck, O.",WOS:000301703800032,"Verbruggen, Heroen, H.","Phycology Research Group and Centre for Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Ghent University",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0030813,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we undertake a synthesis of present knowledge of biodiversity in European Seas and identify remaining challenges that prevent sustainable management of marine biodiversity in one of the most exploited continents of the globe. Our analysis demonstrates that changes in faunal standing stock with depth depends on the size of the fauna, with macrofaunal abundance only declining with increasing water depth below 1000 m, whilst there was no obvious decrease in meiofauna with increasing depth. Species richness was highly variable for both deep water macro- and meio- fauna along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Nematode biodiversity decreased from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean whilst latitudinal related biodiversity patterns were similar for both faunal groups investigated, suggesting that the same environmental drivers were influencing the fauna. While climate change and habitat degradation are the most frequently implicated stressors affecting biodiversity throughout European Seas, quantitative understanding, both at individual and cumulative/synergistic level, of their influences are often lacking. Full identification and quantification of species, in even a single marine habitat, remains a distant goal, as we lack integrated data-sets to quantify these. While the importance of safeguarding marine biodiversity is recognised by policy makers, the lack of advanced understanding of species diversity and of a full survey of any single habitat raises huge challenges in quantifying change, and facilitating/prioritising habitat/ecosystem protection. Our study highlights a pressing requirement for more complete biodiversity surveys to be undertaken within contrasting habitats, together with investigations in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning links and identification of separate and synergistic/cumulative human-induced impacts on biodiversity.","Narayanaswamy, B.E.; Coll, M.; Danovaro, R.; Davidson, K.; Ojaveer, H.; Renaud, P.E.",WOS:000316411600015,"Narayanaswamy, Bhavani, B.E.","Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban, Argyll, Scotland.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0058909,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Europe,,"Biodiversity, ""Ecosystems"", ""Protection"", ""Species diversity""",,,"Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Scottish Marine Inst, Oban, Argyll, Scotland.",Scotland,,MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; CONSERVATION; RESILIENCE; HABITATS; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; DECLINE; SHARKS,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS),,UK,,Research institute,Science

We asked the question: Where will climate change have the greatest impact on three foundational, macroalgal species that occur along North-Atlantic shores: <i>Fucus serratus</i>,<i> Fucus vesiculosus,</i> and <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>? To predict distributional changes of these key species under three IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) over the coming two centuries, we generated Ecological Niche Models with the program MAXENT. Model predictions suggest that these three species will shift northwards as an assemblage or “unit” and that phytogeographic changes will be most pronounced in the southern Arctic and the southern temperate provinces. Our models predict that Arctic shores in Canada, Greenland, and Spitsbergen will become suitable for all three species by 2100. Shores south of 45° North will become unsuitable for at least two of the three focal species on both the Northwest- and Northeast-Atlantic coasts by 2200.

In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential ‘mediation effects’ among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80% of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions.

Many sharks returned to The Bahamas after ~150 days. Estimated residency times within The Bahamas EEZ, where longlining and commercial trade of sharks is illegal, were generally high (mean = 68.2% of time). Sharks spent 99.7% of their time shallower than 200 m and did not exhibit differences in day and night mean depths.

Although many studies have been conducted to their use and potential, only few authors have considered their use in the High Seas. In this paper, we investigate the effects of fish growth enhancing MPAs on the formation of regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) for highly migratory fish stocks. We argue that in absence of enforcement MPAs constitute a weakest-link public good, which can only be realized if everyone agrees. We combine this notion with a game theoretic model of RFMO formation to derive potentially stable RFMOs with and without MPAs. We find that MPAs generally increase the parameter range over which RFMOs are stable, and that they increase stability in a number of cases as compared to the case without MPAs. They do not necessarily induce a fully cooperative solution among all fishing nations. In summary, results of this paper suggest a positive role for MPAs in the High Seas.","Punt, M.J.; Weikard, H-J.; Van Ierland, E.C.",WOS:000318187800003,"Van Ierland, E.C.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1939-7445.2012.00133.x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,"Game theory, ""Marine reserves""",,Marine protected areas; Weakest-link public goods; Bioeconomic modeling,"Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Grp Agr & Food Econ, Weihenstephaner Steig 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Germany,Marine protected areas; game theory; weakest-link public goods; bioeconomic modeling; marine reserves,ENDOGENOUS MINIMUM PARTICIPATION; FISHERIES; STABILITY; RESERVES; MANAGEMENT; COALITIONS; LINK,"Environmental Sciences; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematics,Technical University of Munich - Centre of Life & Food Sciences,x,Germany,,Research institute,Science

Out of a total of 336 protected areas identified in Brazilian coastal and marine areas, the North Platform has the largest protected area, but the ecosystem with the largest number of protected area, predominantly sustainable areas, was the East Coast followed by the South Platform. One of the reasons the eastern coast of Brazil to have more protected areas is the fact that there is a largest amount of coral reefs. Additionally there was political opportunities for the creation of protected areas for sustainable use. The coastal region of Brazil has achieved the goal proposed by the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity – 7, but only then through the category V of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which is not the best efficient means of conserving resources. The goal for marine conservation shows only the area above the recommended under protection in North Platform. The Marine portion of the East Coast and the South Platform has few protected areas, regardless of category management. We consider the coastal region the range of 12 nautical miles from baselines determined in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As for the number of strategies permitted by law and used for the conservation of coastal and marine systems, coastal systems show a higher number when compared with the marine system.

We tested whether, at the country level, the proportion of a country designated as a conservation priority was correlated with where NGOs spent money. For one model (the combination of Conservation International's hotspots and High Biodiversity Wilderness Areas, which are areas of high endemism with high or low levels of vegetation loss respectively), there was no relation between the proportion of a country designated as a priority and levels of NGO spending, including by the NGO associated with the model. In the second model (Global 200), the proportion of a country designated as a priority and the amount of money spent by NGOs were significantly and positively related. Less money was spent in countries in northern and western sub-Saharan Africa than countries in southern and eastern Africa, relative to the proportion of the country designated as a conservation priority. We suggest that on the basis of our results some NGOs consider increasing their spending on the areas designated as of conservation priority which are currently relatively underfunded, although there are economic, political, cultural, historical, biological, and practical reasons why current spending patterns may not align with priority sites.","Holmes, G.; Scholfield, K.; Brockington, D.",WOS:000306559300004,"Holmes, George, G.","Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01879.x,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Africa,,Conservation,,Africa; conservation spending; high biodiversity wilderness areas;hotspots; NGOs; prioritization modeling; Africa; areas de importanciapara la conservacion; areas silvestres con alta biodiversidad; gasto enconservacion; modelos de priorizacion; ONGs,"Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",England,Africa; conservation spending; high biodiversity wilderness areas; hotspots; NGOs; prioritization modeling; Africa; areas de importancia para la conservacion; areas silvestres con alta biodiversidad; gasto en conservacion; modelos de priorizacion; ONGs,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; HOTSPOTS,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Leeds,,UK,,University,Science

Experience from terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to effectively coordinate across multiple management regimes.

We introduce two methods that aim to improve the transferability of presence-only models: density-based occurrence thinning and performance-based predictor selection. We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea (previously Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea) and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process. The inferred distribution model of Caulerpa cylindracea shows the potential for this species to further spread along the coasts of Western Europe, western Africa and the south coast of Australia.","Verbruggen, H.; Tyberghein, L.; Belton, G.S.; Mineur, F.; Jueterbock, A.; Hoarau, G.; Gurgel, C.

However, well-informed decisions and evaluation of the impacts of fisheries on ecosystems must be based on total removals, so including the part of the catch that is discarded at sea or not reported as landings. Total removals by Belgian fisheries from all ICES fishing areas and from the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS) from 1929 to 2010, were reconstructed by including unreported and misreported landings of the commercial fleet, unreported landings by the recreational and artisanal/subsistence fisheries and by estimating discards for the most important fisheries. Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. The reconstructed total removals on the BNS were estimated to be 55% higher than the 0.8 million t publicly reported over this period. Discards represent an average annual of 34% of the total removals on the BNS over the entire period. The results suggest that since the 2000s, approximately 50% of all Belgian removals from its EEZ are unreported landings and discards (IUU). The unreported landings and discards are increasingly taken by non-commercial, small-scale (<12 m) vessels that are not subject to reporting and not taken into consideration in planning, monitoring and enforcement. While the present paper provides a first attempt to reconstruct historical total removals for Belgium's sea fisheries, it also addresses the gaps in data and information that need to be resolved to improve the reliability of the estimates of unaccounted removals. The reconstructed time series provides a context for the wider debate about how to move to more sustainable fisheries, what the role of small-scale fisheries are, how to achieve the agreed policy targets in Belgian marine waters and in particular in the marine areas protected under the EU Habitat and Bird directives.","Lescrauwaet, A.-K.; Torreele, E.; Vincx, M.; Polet, H.; Mees, J.",WOS:000325191900019,"Mees, Jan, J.","Ghent University, Marine Biology research group",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.fishres.2013.05.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Belgium,,"By catch, ""Fishery statistics"", ""Historical account"", ""Marine fisheries""",,Catch reconstruction; IUU; EEZ; unreported catch,"Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, InnovOcean Site,Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Belgium,Catch reconstruction; IUU; Belgium; EEZ,DISCARDS; MORTALITY; TRAWLERS; IMPACT; FLEET,Fisheries,Fisheries,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

The genus <em>Scaphander</em> is a group of predominantly deep-sea, infaunal cephalaspids with about 40% of its species (eight) occurring on the Atlantic Ocean. They are carnivorous and have a unique digestive system with a large, strongly muscularized gizzard containing three sizable and heavily calcified plates. This work aims to describe the diet of <em>Scaphander</em>, to evaluate if there is a functional relation between the anatomy of the digestive tract and exploitation of novel food resources, and to assess if dietary specialization may have played a role in the diversification of the Atlantic species of <em>Scaphander</em>. Gut contents were studied from 31 specimens representing seven of the Atlantic species using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The chemical composition of the gizzard plates was analysed by X-ray microanalysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Foraminiferans, including agglutinating forms, were shown to be the most important food item for <em>Scaphander</em>; bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, and polychaetes with calcareous tubes were also found to form part of the diet. The gizzard plates were shown to consist of a phosphate-rich amorphous component and a crystalline component identified as fluorite (hardness 4; Moh's scale). It is suggested that the ability of <em>Scaphander</em> gastropods to prey upon organisms with hard tests, particularly agglutinating foraminiferans, is not only due to the hardness of the gizzard plates but to the cumulative effect of shape and hardness of the gizzard plates and relative size of the gizzard and associated musculature.

Belgian fisheries: ten decades, seven seas, forty species: Historical time-series to reconstruct landings, catches, fleet and fishing areas from 1900. PhD Thesis. Ghent University (UGent): Gent.  xiii, 242 pp.","Human activity has been impacting marine ecosystems for millennia, and fishing is most often seen as the cause of overexploitation and depletion of marine biological resources (Myers and Worm 2003, Salomon 2009). There is a wealth of recent studies illustrating how our perception of pristine conditions in the seas and oceans has shifted over generations. This is referred to as ‘Shifting Baselines’. A wide range of evidence about (pre) historical reference conditions and early baselines has increased the awareness on the limitations associated with the current scientific methods to determine appropriate reference conditions against which current targets for conservation and management are set, in particular for fisheries (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008). It is acknowledged that environmental reference conditions and targets must strive to integrate all available and relevant data and information for improved assessments, including incorporating historical data into conservation and management frameworks (Pinnegar and Engelhard 2008, McClenachan et al. 2012). Historical data can contribute in explaining underlying cause-effect relations in changes in the ecosystems, potentially reveal information and knowledge from past conditions (Jackson et al. 2001), and help defining reference conditions and achievable targets for environmental management today. The present thesis focuses on quantitative data to extend the timeframe of current analyses on fisheries (landings, fleet dynamics, spatial dynamics, indexes of productivity of the fleet and impact of fishing) and on the reconstruction of historical timeseries to expand our knowledge on historical references for the Belgian sea fisheries. In achieving this, it intends to counter the concept of 'Shifting Baselines' applied to the Belgian Sea fisheries. The ‘Historical Fisheries Database’ (HiFiDatabase) is a product of this thesis. It is the result of a thorough search, rescue, inventory, standardization and integration of data for Belgium’s sea fisheries that were not available before in the public domain or were not available before in the appropriate format for redistribution. It is documented and stored in the Marine Data Archive of Flanders Marine Institute and is freely available for end-users. It contains a unique and substantial collection of time series with standardized species names, reporting units, fishing areas and ports of landing (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010b). It is a ‘living’ product in the sense that new, relevant, quality-controlled time-series can be added as they are discovered or produced. Considering the relative size of the fleet, the short coastline and the limited number of fish auctions and fishing ports in Belgium, it is fair to say that the present reconstruction of Belgian sea fisheries depicts a relatively complete picture of historical volume, value and composition of landings, fleet dynamics, fishing effort and spatial dynamics. The project and its methodology offer a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The reconstructed time-series indicate that, since the onset of systematic reporting mechanisms in Belgium in 1929, landings reported by the Belgian sea fisheries both in foreign and in Belgian ports amounted to 3.3 million tonnes (t). After a maximum of 80,000 t in 1947, annual landings declined steadily to only 26% of this peak by 2008 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The most important species over the observed period in terms of landings were cod (17% of all landings) and herring (16%), closely followed by plaice (14%), sole (8%), whiting (6%) and rays (6%). In terms of economic value and based on values corrected for inflation, sole (31%) and cod (15%) were the most valuable, closely followed by plaice (11%), brown shrimp (5%), rays (5%) and turbot (3%). Near to 73% of all landings originated from 5 of the 31 fishing areas. Twenty percent of all landings originated from the ‘coastal waters’, while these waters contributed nearly 60% of all landed pelagic species and 55% of all landed ‘molluscs and crustaceans’. The North Sea (south) and the Iceland Sea were next in importance with 17% and 16% of all landings respectively. The eastern and western part of the central North Sea, contributed each with approximately 10% of the total landings (Lescrauwaet et al. 2010a). The Belgian fisheries have followed a development of 3 major successive exploitation phases in which 3 major target species or target species groups were exploited until events or processes triggered a transition to a new phase: a ‘herring’ period between 1929 and 1950, a ‘cod’ (and other gadoid and roundfish) period between 1950 and 1980 and a period marked by plaice/sole between 1980 and 2000 (and after). This successive exploitation of targeted species was also associated with exploited fishing grounds, successively the Coastal waters for herring, the Icelandic Sea for cod, the North Sea south and the North Sea central (east and west) for sole/plaice, later also complemented by the ‘western waters’ (English Channel, Bristol Channel, Irish Sea) for the flatfish fisheries. To understand and interpret the trends in landings and changes in target species (groups), it is crucial to look at trends and changes in the fishing fleet and the fishing sector inserted in a wider socio-economic and political context. In the present thesis work, a reconstruction was made of the fleet size (from 1830), tonnage (from 1842) and engine power (kW from 1912) of the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. The time-series show a 85% decrease in fleet size and a 5% decrease in overall engine power (kW) since WWII. This decrease was compensated by a 10-fold increase in average tonnage (GT) per vessel and a 6-fold increase in average engine power (kW) per vessel. In only 10 years time after WWII, the fleet size decreased from approximately 550 to 450 vessels in 1955 (Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). Between 1955 and 1970 major structural changes took place in the Belgian sea fisheries fleet. These changes were driven first by the shift in the main fishing activities towards Icelandic waters in the 1950s and in the early 1960s by the governmental subsidies for the purchase of new steel hulled medium-sized motor trawlers and the introduction of the beam-trawl (Poppe 1977, Lescrauwaet et al. 2012). This led to less but more powerful vessels: between 1960 and 1975 the fleet size declined from 430 to approximately 250 vessels (-42%). The decline in fleet size was exacerbated when Iceland demarcated its territorial waters from 12 nm to 50 nm in 1972 and when the presence of Belgian fishermen within the declared 200 nm EEZ of Icelandic waters became subject to a ‘phase-out’ in 1975 (Lescrauwaet et al. under review). As a consequence of the loss of the Icelandic waters towards 1980, Belgian vessels shifted their activities again towards the central part of the North Sea (Omey 1982) and - to a lesser extent - towards the English Channel, Bristol Channel, South and West Ireland and the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards specific programmes were oriented to the decommissioning of ships with the aim to reduce fleet capacity. In 2012, the Belgian commercial sea fishing fleet counted 86 ships, with a total engine capacity of 49,135 kW and gross tonnage of 15,326 GT (Roegiers et al. 2013). The reconstructed time-series suggest that total landings decreased with total fleet size and with total fishing effort. At the level of the Belgian fleet, the total number of days spent at sea decreased from approximately 91,800 days in 1938 to 15,100 days in 2010 (-84%). The landings (kg) per vessel per day at sea or per day fishing have doubled between 1938 and 2010. The time-series shows at least 4 successive events: a first event (1939-1945) marked by WWII and the increased landings of herring in coastal waters. The exceptionally high landings per unit of effort are partly explained by the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the North Sea during WWII combined with the effects of two strong year classes. The second period is situated in 1951-1955 and coincides with the steep increase in landings from Icelandic waters. Thirdly, an increase in landings is observed between 1960 and 1967, which coincides with the state subsidies to introduce the beam trawl firstly in shrimp vessels (1959-1960) and later for flatfish fisheries. A final conspicuous event concerns the period of increased levels of landings per vessel per day between 1977 and 1986. After standardization as landings per unit of installed power (LPUP) to account for the average increase (x6) of engine power per vessel, the landings have decreased by 74% from an average 1,3 t /installed kW in 1944-1947 to 0,38 t /installed kW in 2009-2010. Interestingly, the average price of landings (all species, all areas , all fisheries aggregated) is negatively correlated with the decreasing fishing effort and decrease in overall landings. This suggests that the Belgian sea fisheries compensated for the losses by targeting species that achieve better market prices. Although the LPUP are illustrative of the changes in the productivity of fisheries, they cannot be interpreted as a proxy of change in biomass of commercial fish stocks, because the Belgian fisheries have targeted different species and fishing areas over time. Trend analysis to study change in fish stocks must be conducted at the level of different métiers or fisheries, taking into account issues such as specificity and selectivity of gear, environmental conditions in the targeted fishing area, seasonality of fishing and behavior of target species. In the present thesis, a closer look was taken at the impact of sea fisheries. In a first part, a quantitative approach was taken to reconstruct total removals by Belgian sea fisheries by including the unreported and misreported landings of commercial and recreational fishing, as well as an estimation of discards. The methodology applied in this reconstruction can serve as a blueprint for similar reconstructions in other countries. The results are useful to inform current policy issues and societal challenges. This reconstruction covers 6 fisheries with historical or current importance for Belgium (Lescrauwaet et al. 2013). Total reconstructed removals were estimated at 5.2 million t or 42% higher than the 3.7 million t publicly reported over this period. Unreported landings and discards were estimated to represent respectively 3.5% (0.2 million t) and 26% (1.3 million t) of these total reconstructed removals. During the WWII, the Belgian fisheries benefited a 10-fold increase in catches and 5-fold increase in LPUE of North Sea ‘Downs’ herring. In the present thesis, these increased catches were explained by the combined effects of a major increase in catch power after WWI, the effects of the cessation of large-scale herring fisheries in the central part of the North Sea and by the effects of strong pre-WWII year classes (Lescrauwaet et al. revised manuscript under review). A third subchapter focused on the otter trawl fishery in Icelandic waters targeting cod. This fishery was of great economic importance in Belgium but decreased with the ‘cod wars’ (1958 and 1972) coming finally to a complete end in 1996. While the decline in total landings from Icelandic waters started after Iceland expanded its EEZ in 1958, the fishing effort of the Belgian fleet continued to increase until a peak was reached in 1963. The results show that the decline in the Iceland cod stock was visible at different levels; the decrease in the proportional importance of cod in the overall landings, the 75% decrease in the LPUE (1946-1983), the decline in the proportion of ‘large’ fishes, and finally the decline or shift in the definition of a ‘large’ specimen. As a result of this thesis, unique data are presented on the trends in volume and composition of landings for the Belgian part of the North Sea (BNS). The waters of the BNS are considered as the most important fishing area in terms of source of food for local population, but also as the most stable provider of food. The BNS and in particular the ecosystem of shallow underwater sandbanks is also important as (post)spawning and nursery area (Leloup and Gilis 1961, Gilis 1961, Leloup and Gilis 1965, Rabaut et.al 2007). The HiFiDatabase broadens the historical view on fisheries and serves as a basis for a range of potential research, management applications, and in support of policy-making. In particular, the time-series provide unique historical reference conditions of fishing in the Belgian part of the North Sea and a potential baseline for fisheries management in territorial waters or for the coastal fisheries. The latter is useful in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU Habitat Directive and the proposal for Maritime Spatial Planning on the Belgian part of the North Sea. Finally in the present thesis work, important efforts were dedicated to approach the history of fisheries from different disciplines of work. The results underline the importance of collecting economic data, inventorying historical archives and historical legislation, historical economy and politics, in order to improve the interpretation and analysis of results. As advocated by the current integrated policies for the marine environment, both the challenge of the task and the richness of the results rely on a multidisciplinary approach.

The integration of historical time series on the landings and value of landings of Belgian sea fisheries, by fishing area, allows for a spatial analysis of broad-scaled historical preference of different Belgian fisheries for specific fishing areas. It documents changes in the relative importance of fishing areas for the Belgian fisheries as well as changes in composition of landings from within fishing areas over 8 decades (1929-2009) and underlines the historical importance of the 'coastal waters' to the Belgian fisheries. Finally, qualitative and quantitative statements about the spatial dynamics of Belgian fisheries in published sources are validated and, where not supported by our data, challenged.

Our analysis of 22 countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea showed that the strongest economic, trade, tourism, and political ties are clearly among the three northwestern countries of Italy, France, and Spain. Although economic activity between countries is often seen as a threat, it may also serve as an indicator of the potential of collaboration in conservation. Using data for threatened marine vertebrate species, we show how areas prioritized for conservation shift spatially when economic factors are used as a surrogate to favor areas where collaborative potential in conservation is more likely.

They have a multitude of ecosystem functions, constitute an important habitat for a variety of fauna and flora and hold important economic, social and cultural value as prime recreational assets. Predictions on sea level rise, intensified storms, accelerated erosion and flood risk for the North Sea have led to the drafting of the Belgian Integrated Coastal Safety Plan. In order to protect the Belgian coastline against erosion and coastal flooding on a short and long term basis (up to 2050), the Belgian sandy beaches face a multitude of beach nourishment activities over the next years. This soft coastal defence measure safeguards the natural dynamics of the coast and has little impact on the beach ecology and tourism compared to other options. However, together with the multitude of human beach functions such as tourism and economic development, beach nourishment potentially threatens the natural balance of the beach and coastal ecosystem. As management of the coastal zone is clearly a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined, coastal management desperately needs ecological dimensions. Hence, solid and meaningful biological and ecological information is needed.

The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao’s Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites (‘community evenness’), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.","Stuart-Smith, R.D.; Bates, A.E.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Duffy, E.; Baker, S.C.; Thomson, R.J.; Stuart-Smith, J.F.; Hill, N.A.; Kininmoth, S.J.; Airoldi, L.; Becerro, M.A.; Campbell, S.J.; Dawson, T.P.; Navarrete, S.A.; Soler, G.A.; Strain, E.M.A.; Willis, T.J.; Edgar, G.J.",WOS:000324826300056,"Becerro, Mikel, M.A.",,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1038/nature12529,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,"Biodiversity, ""Environmental Managers &amp; Monitoring"", ""Exploitable Scientific Result"", ""Marine Sciences"", ""Policy Makers / Decision Makers"", ""Scientific Community"", ""Scientific Publication""",,Biodiversity      Conservation      Macroecology      Food webs ,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of the spatial distribution of catches of tuna and bycatch species over the gear, that can affect the estimated tuna abundance, is still neglected. In this study, we analyzed data obtained from 147 instrumented pelagic longline sets equipped with hook timers and temperature depth recorders to characterize the distribution of hooking contacts and success at a fine temporal and spatial scale. Scientific surveys were carried out in the Central-South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia), targeting tropical (Thunnus albacares, T. obesus) and temperate (T. alalunga) tuna. Data analysis based on spatial point processes and stochastic modeling demonstrate the presence of spatio-temporal clusters for both hooking contacts and hooking success.

Our sample included 243 specimens ascribed to seven currently accepted species from 51 sites. Five of the samples were from either the type locality of a nominal species or a close nearby locality (<i>O. edwardsii</i> from Corsica, <i>O. carmelae</i> and <i>O. piantonii</i> from the Kerkennah Islands, <i>O. hispidula</i> from the Gulf of Gabès and <i>O. leukos</i> from the Canary Islands), one from the inferred original locality (<i>O. ingloria</i> from Venice Lagoon), and specimens assigned in the recent literature to <i>O. nicolai</i>. We used a combination of distance- and tree-based species delimitation methods to identify Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) to compare with the <i>a?priori</i> species identifications.

The eight-MOTUs scenario, shared by the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) methods, comprises the following major clades: clade A contains the south Tunisian species <i>Ocinebrina piantonii</i> Cecalupo, Buzzurro & Mariani from which the sympatric taxon <i>O. carmelae</i> Cecalupo, Buzzurro & Mariani (new synonym) cannot be separated; clades B and C bring together all populations from the Aegean Sea and some from the Ionian Sea, respectively; clade D groups, on the one hand, the south Tunisian samples morphologically assigned to <i>O. hispidula</i> Pallary and, on the other, Atlantic and Alboran Sea samples (including the Canarian taxon <i>O. leukos</i> Houart); clade E includes a sample from the type locality of <i>O. edwardsii</i> and several samples from the Tyrrhenian Sea; clades F and G correspond to a few samples from the Venice Lagoon and the Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively; clade H groups the bulk of samples from the Adriatic Sea, including samples from the Venice Lagoon morphologically identified as <i>Ocinebrina ingloria</i> (Crosse), and some from the Ionian Sea. No final conclusions could be reached to reconcile the currently recognized morphological taxa with the clades suggested by the COI data. The geographical structure proposed by the mitochondrial markers is similar to that found in other marine invertebrates and partially corresponds to the species defined by shell characters.

Specifically, we determine the extent to which environmental conditions can predict genus richness in macroalgae. We also evaluate whether the magnitude or direction of the effect of environmental factors, or their ability to explain variation in macroalgal diversity, varies geographicallyLocationGlobal oceans.MethodsWe formulated and fitted global spatial regression models and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to determine the extent to which environmental conditions could predict genus richness in macroalgae. GWR allowed us to determine how the role of environmental conditions varied amongst geographical regionsResultsThe global regression model showed that sea surface temperature and nutrients were important predictors of macroalgal genus richness at a global scale. However, GWR revealed that environmental factors explained less variability in richness in the tropics than elsewhereMain conclusionsOur results show that whilst environmental conditions influence marine macroalgal diversity, the strength of this influence shows considerable geographical variation. In particular, environmental conditions explain more of the observed variation in diversity at high latitudes than at low latitudes. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that environmental tolerances influence species distributions more strongly at high latitudes, whereas other factors, such as biotic interactions, play a more prominent role in the tropics.","Keith, S.A.; Kerswell, A.P.; Connolly, S.R.",WOS:000333417100001,"Keith, Sally, S.A.","James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1111/geb.12132,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,    Biogeography;     colonization;     competition;     geographically weighted regression;     herbivory;     macroecology;     origination;     seaweed;     species interactions;     time-for-speciation,,,,,,,James Cook University,x,Australia,,University,Science

Many scientific projects and initiatives published information on species and biodiversity on the World Wide Web without users needing to pay for it. However, these resources often stagnated when project funding expired. Based on a large pool of experiences worldwide, this article discusses what measures will help such data resources develop beyond the project lifetime.Biodiversity data, just as data in many other disciplines, are often not generated automatically by machines or sensors. Data on for example species are based on human observations and interpretation. This requires continuous data curation to keep these up to date. Creators of online biodiversity databases should consider whether they have the resources to make their database of such value that other scientists and/or institutions would continue to finance its existence. To that end, it may be prudent to engage such partners in the development of the resource from an early stage. Managers of existing biodiversity databases should reflect on the factors being important for sustainability. These include the extent, scope, quality and uniqueness of database content; track record of development; support from scientists; support from institutions, and clarity of Intellectual Property Rights. Science funders should give special attention to the development of scholarly databases with expert-validated content. The science community has to become aware of the efforts of scientists in contributing to open-access databases, including by citing these resources in the Reference lists of publications that use them. Science culture must thus adapt its practices to support online databases as scholarly publications.To sustain such databases, we recommend they should (a) become integrated into larger collaborative databases or information systems with a consequently larger user community and pool of funding opportunities, and (b) be owned and curated by a science organisation, society, or institution with a suitable mandate. Good governance and proactive communication with contributors is important to maintain the team enthusiasm that launched the resource. Experience shows that ‘bigger is better’ in terms of database size because the resource will have more content, more potential and known uses and users of its content, more contributors, be more prestigious to contribute to, and have more funding options. Furthermore, most successful biodiversity databases are managed by a partnership of individuals and organisations.","Costello, M.J.; Appeltans, W.; Bailly, N.; Berendsohn, W.G.; de Jong, Y.; Edwards, M.; Froese, R.; Huettmann, F.; Los, W.; Mees, J.; Segers, H.; Bisby, F.A.",WOS:000336874100018,"de Jong, Yde, Y.",,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.042,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Funding, ""Intellectual property"", ""Publications"", ""Species"", ""Taxonomy""",,Citation,"Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",New Zealand,Species; Taxonomy; Publication; Citation; Funding; Intellectual property,INFORMATICS; BIOLOGY; RATES,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,University of Auckland - Institute of Marine Science,,New Zealand,,Research institute,Science

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure. Fish did not leave the area in-between feeding periods. Hence other benefits (i.e. shelter against currents and predators) besides food availability stimulate the aggregation behaviour at the WARs.","Reubens, J.; De Rijcke, M.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.",WOS:000329884700021,"De Rijcke, Maarten, M.","Ghent University, Biology Department, Marine Biology Section",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2013.05.005,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",,Gadus morhua,,,    Diel Activity;     Gadus morhua;     Feeding;     Artificial Hard Substrates;     Offshore Wind Farms,"Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Diel Activity; Gadus morhua; Feeding; Artificial Hard Substrates; Offshore Wind Farms,GADUS-MORHUA; ARTIFICIAL REEFS; STOMACH CONTENTS; NORTH-SEA; TRISOPTERUS-LUSCUS; PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; SITE FIDELITY; BEHAVIOR; FISH; FISHERIES,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Three main regions, the Baltic Sea (BS), the North Sea and English Channel (NS), and the Bay of Biscay (BB), were tested for possible geographic (latitudinal) differences in the SI values. In spring, only BS showed lower delta C-13 values of seston and Mytilus spp., and higher delta N-15 values of SOM, than NS and BB. No significant differences between the 3 regions were found in autumn. Irrespective of season and regions, Mytilus spp. was more C-13-depleted than M. balthica. delta C-13 values of M. balthica, but not those of Mytilus spp., were significantly correlated with SOM. These results are consistent with differences in feeding behavior of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica, as the two species are known as obligatory-suspension and facultative-deposit feeders, respectively. In contrast, no differences in the delta N-15 values of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica were found at individual stations, indicating the same trophic level of the two bivalves within the food webs. At some stations, irrespective of geographic location, both bivalves showed delta N-15 values up to 18-20 aEuro degrees. These were two trophic levels higher than those found at the other stations, indicating local and/or episodic eutrophic conditions, probably due to waste water discharge, and the effectiveness of both Mytilus spp. and M. balthica as bio-indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication. Overall, our results suggest that pathways of energy flow from OM pools to dominant bivalves is more related to local environmental conditions than to geographic regions across the European coastline. This has implications for food web studies along the Atlantic coast because most of the values are consistent over a large area and show no significant differences. Therefore, the present study can be used twofold for the determination of trophic baselines and for the correction of the trophic position of consumers higher up in the food web in the case of differences in waste water discharge.","Magni, P.; Rajagopal, S.; Como, S.; Jansen, J.M.; van der Velde, G.; Hummel, H.",WOS:000315275400006,"Hummel, H.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2110-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,"CNR, IAMC, I-09170 Torregrande, Oristano, Italy.",Italy,,NITROGEN ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; SUSPENSION-FEEDING BIVALVES; ESTUARINE FOOD WEBS; OLERON BAY FRANCE; DUTCH WADDEN SEA; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN; BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

The abundance of AOA and AOB was analysed using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization and (real-time) quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) targeting archaeal and bacterial amoA genes. Archaeal abundance was similar between sponge species, while bacterial abundance was higher in H. caerulea than in N. nodastrella and H. thielei. Q-PCR showed that AOA outnumbered AOB by a factor of 2 to 35, suggesting a larger role of AOA than of AOB in ammonia oxidation in sponges. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to analyse the taxonomic affiliation of the microbial community associated with these sponges. Archaeal and bacterial amoA genes were found in all 3 sponges. The structure of the phylogenetic trees in relation to temperature and sponge species was analysed using all published amoA sequences retrieved from sponges. Temperature was an important factor influencing the distribution of nitrifiers in sponges. Both archaeal and bacterial amoA sponge sequences tended to cluster with sequences retrieved from habitats of similar temperature. This is the first time that similarity in AOB diversity is described between distantly related species (H. thielei belonging to the class Demospongiae, and N. nodastrella to Hexactinellida). The results described here support the idea of a relatively uniform microbial community between distantly related sponges and suggest that temperature (rather than phylogenetic distance) is determining the diversity of AOA and AOB in sponges.","Cardoso, J.F.M.F.; van Bleijswijk, J.D.L.; Witte, H.; van Duyl, F.C.",WOS:000316361700003,"Cardoso, Joana, J.F.M.F.",NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research,https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01610,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"archaea, ""Bacteria""",,,amoA gene; Archaea; Bacteria; Temperature; Marine; Sponges</td>,"NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",Netherlands,amoA gene; Archaea; Bacteria; Temperature; Marine; Sponges,IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; TARGETED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; CATALYZED REPORTER DEPOSITION; DISSOLVED INORGANIC NITROGEN; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; MARINE SPONGES,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Microbiology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Microbiology,NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research,,Netherlands,,Research institute,Science

It was therefore surprising that in a ciliate-contaminated experiment the growth rate of the phytoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi was significantly reduced. As U. marinum does not ingest E. huxleyi cells, their growth inhibition was probably caused by a toxin secreted by the ciliate, presumably a novel type of chemical interaction between ciliates and phytoplankton. A possible function of toxin secretion is to lyse algal cells that are too large for U. marinum to ingest, to increase dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and hence the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, the main food source of U. marinum. To test this hypothesis U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures was added to cultures of phytoplankton with different cell sizes. The presence of U. marinum or the filtrate of U. marinum cultures showed an inhibiting growth effect and a negative effect on the physiology of all species tested although both effects were variable between species. Diatoms appeared less sensitive than non-diatom species. U. marinum acclimatization to phytoplankton led to stronger inhibiting effects, presumably from increased toxin production. Bacterial DGGE analysis of U. marinum cultures did not reveal known toxic bacteria that might account for the observed negative effects on the phytoplankton. Bacterial growth rates in an E. huxleyi culture increased when U. marinum filtrate had been added. In mixed cultures of bacteria, E. huxleyi and U. marinum, bacterial abundance first increased, then decreased due to ciliate predation. These findings support the hypothesis that toxin secretion by U. marinum increases non-prey phytoplankton-derived DOM and stimulates the growth of the bacterial prey.","Schaafsma, F.L.; Peperzak, L.",WOS:000314935000003,"Schaafsma, F.L.",University of Groningen,https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10124,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Bacteria, ""Uronema marinum Dujardin, 1841""",,,Uronema marinum; Toxin; Phytoplankton; Bacteria; Growth rate;Physiology; Flow cytometry; FDA; Epifluorescence microscopy,"Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Biol Oceanog, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Uronema marinum; Toxin; Phytoplankton; Bacteria; Growth rate; Physiology; Flow cytometry; FDA; Epifluorescence microscopy,CHEMICAL DEFENSE; PLANKTONIC PROTOZOA; PRYMNESIUM-PARVUM; EUPLOTIN-C; IN-SITU; MECHANISMS; RATES; SCUTICOCILIATIDA; MORPHOLOGY; TURBULENCE,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of Groningen (RUG),,Netherlands,,University,Science

Abundance and classical species diversity indices (S, H', J) of macrofaunal communities were related to principal attributes of food webs (relative trophic level and food chain length, FCL) that were determined from carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values. Structure of marine macrobenthos varies substantially at a geographical scale; total abundance ranges from 63 ind. m(-2) to 34,517 ind. m(-2), species richness varies from 3 to 166 and the Shannon-Weaver diversity index from 0.26 to 3.26 while Pielou's evenness index is below 0.73. The major source of energy for macrobenthic communities is suspended particulate organic matter, consisting of phytoplankton and detrital particles, sediment particulate organic matter, and microphytobenthos in varying proportions. These food sources support the presence of suspension- and deposit-feeding communities, which dominate numerically on the sea floor. Benthic food webs include usually four to five trophic levels (FCL varies from 3.08 to 4.86). Most species are assigned to the second trophic level (primary consumers), fewer species are grouped in the third trophic level (secondary consumers), and benthic top predators are the least numerous. Most species cluster primarily at the lowest trophic level that is consistent with the typical organization of pyramidal food webs. Food chain length increases with biodiversity, highlighting a positive effect of more complex community structure on food web organisation. In more diverse benthic communities, energy is transferred through more trophic levels while species-poor communities sustain a shorter food chain.","Sokolowski, A.; Wolowicz, M.; Asmus, H.; Asmus, R.; Carlier, A.; Gasiunaité, Z.; Grémare, A.; Hummel, H.; Lesutiené, J.; Razinkovas, A.; Renaud, P.E.; Richard, P.; Kędra, M.",WOS:000307610900009,"Sokolowski, A.","University of Gda?nsk, Institute of Oceanography",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.011,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,macrobenthic communities; biodiversity; food web structure;diversity-structure interactions; European waters,"Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Al Pilsudskiego 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland.",Poland,macrobenthic communities; biodiversity; food web structure; diversity-structure interactions; European waters,STABLE-ISOTOPES; TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS; ORGANIC-MATTER; DELTA-N-15; CARBON; DELTA-C-13; ECOSYSTEM; NITROGEN; ESTUARIES; FRANCE,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,University of Gdańsk,,Poland,,University,Science

Compared to most other phyla, phylogenetic relationships among sponges are still largely unresolved. In the past 10 years, the classical taxonomy has been completely overturned and a review of the state of the art appears necessary. The field of taxonomy remains a prominent discipline of sponge research and studies related to sponge systematics were in greater number in the Eighth World Sponge Conference (Girona, Spain, September 2010) than in any previous world sponge conferences. To understand the state of this rapidly growing field, this chapter proposes to review studies, mainly from the past decade, in sponge taxonomy, nomenclature and phylogeny. In a first part, we analyse the reasons of the current success of this field. In a second part, we establish the current sponge systematics theoretical framework, with the use of (1) cladistics, (2) different codes of nomenclature (Phylo-Code vs. Linnaean system) and (3) integrative taxonomy. Sponges are infamous for their lack of characters. However, by listing and discussing in a third part all characters available to taxonomists, we show how diverse characters are and that new ones are being used and tested, while old ones should be revisited. We then review the systematics of the four main classes of sponges (Hexactinellida, Calcispongiae, Homoscleromorpha and Demospongiae), each time focusing on current issues and case studies. We present a review of the taxonomic changes since the publication of the Systema Porifera (2002), and point to problems a sponge taxonomist is still faced with nowadays. To conclude, we make a series of proposals for the future of sponge systematics. In the light of recent studies, we establish a series of taxonomic changes that the sponge community may be ready to accept. We also propose a series of sponge new names and definitions following the PhyloCode. The issue of phantom species (potential new species revealed by molecular studies) is raised, and we show how they could be dealt with. Finally, we present a general strategy to help us succeed in building a Porifera tree along with the corresponding revised Porifera classification.","Cardenas, P.; Perez, T.; Boury-Esnault, N.",WOS:000308193900003,"Cardenas, Paco, P.","Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Milieux & Peuplements Aquat, BOrEA UMR 7208, F-75231 Paris, France.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-387787-1.00010-6,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Calcispongiae, ""Demospongiae"", ""Hexactinellida"", ""Homoscleromorpha""","Cladistics, ""Classification"", ""Phylogeny""",,Integrative taxonomy;  PhyloCode; Linnaean system; Calcispongiae,,,,,,,Joint Research Unit: Biology of Aquatic Organisms and Ecosystems (BOREA) (UMR 7208),,France,,Research network,Science

This reef complex extends 250 km southward from Yucatan, Mexico, into the Gulf of Honduras, most of it lying 20-40 km off the coast of Belize. A relatively unspoiled ecosystem, it features a great variety of habitats in close proximity, ranging from mangrove islands, seagrass meadows, and patch reefs in its lagoon to the barrier reef along the margin of the continental shelf. Among its varied macrobenthos, sponges stand out for their ubiquity, range of colours, rich species and biomass, and ecological importance; they populate rocky substrates, some sandy bottoms, and the subtidal stilt roots and peat banks of mangroves. Working from a field station established in 1972 on Carrie Bow Cay, a sand islet atop the reef off southern Belize, experts in numerous disciplines from both the Museum and academic institutions throughout the world have explored the area's biodiversity in the broadest sense and community development over time. At last count, 113 researchers (88 working on site) have focused on the biological and geological role of Porifera in Carrie Bow's reef communities, with the results reported in 125 scientific papers to date. The majority of these sponge studies have centred on systematics and faunistics, including quantitative distribution among the various habitats. Taxonomic approaches have ranged from basic morphology to fine structure, DNA barcoding, and ecological manipulations and culminated in a mini-workshop involving several experts on Caribbean Porifera. Ecological work has covered a broad spectrum as well: bioerosion, silica and nutrient cycling, symbiosis, mutualism, space competition, predation, disease, and the effects on sponge individuals and populations of environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity, desiccation, substrate, and sedimentation. Many projects were enhanced by scientific illustration, laboratory studies of larvae settlement preferences and development, and investigations of microbial and invertebrate sponge associates, notably symbiotic cyanobacteria, parazoanthid epizoans, and crustacean and ophiuroid endobionts. Of the striking discoveries, the work on alpheid shrimps colonizing sponges off Carrie Bow Cay has yielded the first report of eusociality in marine organisms.","Rützler, K.",WOS:000308193900004,"Rützler, Klaus, K.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-387787-1.00002-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Bioerosion, ""Coral reefs"", ""Diseases"", ""Ecology"", ""Mangroves"", ""Reproduction"", ""Silicon cycle"", ""Systematics""",,Species interaction; Seagrass meadow,"Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",USA,systematics; ecology; reproduction; species interaction; disease; bioerosion; silicon cycle; coral reef; mangrove; seagrass meadow,ROOT FOULING COMMUNITIES; TWIN-CAYS; CARIBBEAN MANGROVE; WESTERN ATLANTIC; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; VERTICAL TRANSMISSION; DWELLING SHRIMPS; HOST-SPECIFICITY; DEMOSPONGIAE; PORIFERA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Smithsonian Institution - Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History,x,USA,,Museum,Science

Such a quantitative approach has a lot of potentialities in many areas that include setting up conservation priorities, testing biogeographic hypotheses, and assessing the impact of accelerated land use. To further promote the diffusion of such an approach, it is fundamental to develop a flexible, comprehensive, and robust environment capable of enabling practitioners and communities of practice to produce species distribution models more efficiently. A promising way to build such an environment is offered by modern infrastructures promoting the sharing of resources, including hardware, software, data, and services. This paper describes an approach to species distribution modeling based on a Hybrid Data Infrastructure that can offer a rich array of data and data management services by leveraging other infrastructures (including Cloud).

A detailed examination of the feeding ecology of pelagic fish can provide valuable insights in the causes and consequences of these phenomena. The present study investigated the diets of both juvenile and adult herring, sprat, horse mackerel, and adult mackerel in the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS) in relation to the distribution of zooplankton and ambient abiotic conditions. A study sampling pelagic fish and zooplankton simultaneously every month during consecutive years, and spanning nearshore to offshore sampling locations, is unprecedented in the southern North Sea. In all, 71 prey taxa were found in 725       stomachs of fish gathered at ten stations, sampled monthly in 2009 and 2010. The proportion of fish with empty stomachs was    low (11%), and the number of prey species ranged from 0 to 21 sp. per stomach. The diet of herring and sprat was dominated         by calanoid copepods, but herring stomachs also contained many decapod larvae, amphipods, cumaceans, and mysids. Mackerel       added sandeels to an otherwise planktivorous diet. Horse mackerel consumed both benthic and pelagic prey. The highest frequency     of occurrence in the stomachs was observed for the calanoid copepods <em>Temora longicornis</em> (33 408 of all 55 004 prey items identified) and <em>Centropages hamatus</em> (5003 times found). The fullness index ranged between 0 and 20.6, and averaged highest for sprat (0.86), followed by herring           (0.60), horse mackerel (0.26), and mackerel (0.24). We observed a different composition of zooplankton species and life stages      in the plankton samples compared with those in the fish stomachs. More adult and female copepods were eaten than the plankton       samples would suggest. Also, the calanoid copepod <em>Acartia clausi</em>, the most common calanoid species in the BPNS, was barely eaten, as was the case for fish eggs and larvae, and for common planktonic species known to be preyed upon elsewhere (e.g. <em>Oikopleura dioica</em>, <em>Evadne nordmanni</em>,  em>Euterpina acutifrons</em>). Additionally, plankton densities averaged highest in spring and at midshore (20–30 km from shore) stations, but fullness index was highest nearshore (<12 km from shore) and (apart from sprat) in summer. A significant correlation between fullness index and total density of planktonic prey species was not observed, indicating that zooplankton densities were not restrictive. Yet the fact that more than 100 plankton species occurred in the plankton samples and just two of these (<em>T. longicornis</em> and <em>C. hamatus</em>) accounted for nearly three-quarters of all ingested prey items leads us to conclude that even minor changes in the ecology or phenology of these dominant zooplankters could have profound effects on pelagic fish stocks.

The species has a broad range in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, although it is possible that small or isolated patches of suitable habitat may not be occupied due to restrictions on larval supply. Nephrops densities are related to the silt-clay content of sediments, with interactions between habitat quality and density indicating competition for resources. An analysis of density-size interactions across fishery functional management units (FUs) suggests that growth is suppressed at high densities due to competition (e. g. in the western Irish Sea), although recruitment dynamics or size-selective mortality may also shape the size structure of populations. Nephrops biomass available across FUs may be similar, reflecting a constant yield due to the inverse relationship between individual size and population density. Gaps in the understanding of Nephrops' ecology reflect uncertain ageing criteria, reliance on fisheries-dependent data and few if any undisturbed habitats in which to examine fisheries-independent interactions.","Johnson, M.P.; Lordan, C.; Power, A.M.",WOS:000321561100003,"Johnson, Mark, M.P.","Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst Environm Marine & Energy Res, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-410466-2.00002-9,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,"Nephrops norvegicus (Linnaeus, 1758)","Catchability, ""Density"", ""Distribution"", ""Growth"", ""Sediments""",,Ecosystem functions; Fishery interactions; Catch,"Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst Environm Marine & Energy Res, Sch Nat Sci, Galway, Ireland.",Ireland,Distribution; Ecosystem functions; Fishery interactions; Sediment; Density; Growth; Catch; Size,WESTERN IRISH SEA; SOUTH CATALAN SEA; LONG-TERM CHANGES; NORWAY LOBSTER; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; UNDERWATER TELEVISION; TRAWLING DISTURBANCE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; FISHING DISTURBANCE; MEDITERRANEAN SEA,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,National University of Ireland Galway - Ryan Institute (NUIG-RI),,Ireland,,Research institute,Science

Selective settlement of deep-sea and intertidal meiofauna - an experimental approach. MSc Thesis. Ghent University, Marine Biology Research Group: Gent.  31 pp.","The cosmopolitan distribution of many meiofaunal organisms raises questions about the dispersal mechanisms of these animals. Their small size and the lack of a planktonic life stage in many taxa suggest that passive dispersal is the main factor determining distribution and colonization patterns. This study investigates the settling behaviour of meiofauna while descending in a water column. Two ex-situ settling experiments were conducted with (1) macrophyte associated meiofauna from an intertidal flat and (2) meiofauna of microbial mat sediments from the deep-sea Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV). Containers (126L) filled with sieved seawater were used as settling chambers and five different substrates, placed on the bottom of the vessels, were offered to the descending meiofaunal assemblage. The substrates used <i>Fucus spiralis</i>, sulfidic agar medium, bare agar and an empty Petri dish. For the deepsea experiment azoic sediment with algae, azoic sediment with bacteria, a sulfidic medium, azoic sediment and an empty Petri dish were used. The experiments were run for 12 hours. Significant differences in meiofaunal densities between the treatments were found in both experiments. Nematode and nauplius larvae showed fourfold higher densities in the Fucus treatment compared to the controls in the case of the intertidal experiment. Deep-sea nematodes and harpacticoid copepods in the sulfide treatment differed by a factor of five from all other treatments in terms of densities. Proportions of harpacticoid copepods were increased in the treatments compared to the reference sample. Nematode assemblages in the treatments showed no significant differences to the reference samples. These findings suggest that meiofauna can selectively settle once they are suspended in the water column and therefore actively contribute to their dispersal. In both experiments meiofauna was increased in substrates similar to their original habitat and proportional differences in harpacticoid copepods suggests a more efficient settlement compared to nematodes. The observed active settling behaviour may be very advantageous for the organisms in finding suitable habitat patches in heterogeneous environments. This study confirms previous research and adds important information to the understanding of meiofaunal dispersal mechanisms.","Mevenkamp, L.",,"Mevenkamp, Lisa, L.","Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology, Research Group Marine Biology",,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,"Deep sea, ""Meiofauna""",,,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

This paper provides a preliminary overview of the meiofauna and nematodes inhabiting coral sediments in the outer reef and lagoon habitats of the Maldives, and investigates their relationships with micro-habitat type. The abundance and community structure of the meiofauna and nematodes reveal significant differences between stations. Coral fragments and rubble from the outer reefs seem to act as a trap for the finest sediment, which might contribute to creating a heterogeneous micro-habitat suitable for both epifaunal (Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae genera) and sediment-dwelling (<em class=""a-plus-plus"">Tricoma</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Richtersia</em>, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Ptycholaimellus</em> and <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Molgolaimus</em>) taxa. On the other side, the lagoon’s sediments are mainly colonized by dwelling taxa, probably due to the low-flow regime that enhances the deposition of organic matter and pelite fractions. A high level of diversity was recorded in both the habitats studied. Among the factors that probably determine the high diversity in the lagoon is the presence of small biogenic structures. These are characterized by a high degree of angularity, which might add more complexity to the habitat. The nematodes reveal an overlap in the taxonomic composition between the Maldives and other geographically distant areas, possibly supporting the existence of iso-communities that are typical of the coral degradation zone. Nematode trophic composition reflects differences in availability of food resources; epigrowth and non-selective deposit feeders are dominant in the lagoon, while selective deposit and epistrate feeders are dominant in the outer reefs.","Semprucci, F.; Colantoni, P.; Baldelli, G.; Sbrocca, C.; Rocchi, M.; Balsamo, M.",WOS:000323258000005,"Semprucci, F.","Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Sci Terra Vita & Ambiente DiSTeVA, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1007/s12526-013-0146-7,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Maldive I.,,"Meiofauna, ""Nematodes""",,Subtidal habitats; Habitat heterogeneity; Coral sediments,"Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Sci Terra Vita & Ambiente DiSTeVA, I-61029 Urbino, Italy.",Italy,Meiofauna; Nematodes; Subtidal habitats; Habitat heterogeneity; Maldives; Coral sediments,NEMATODE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FREE-LIVING NEMATODES; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; ROCAS ATOLL NE; DEEP-SEA; PORCUPINE-SEABIGHT; EPSILONEMATIDAE NEMATODA; SUBLITTORAL MEIOFAUNA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; CONTINENTAL-SHELF,Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology,University of Urbino Carlo Bo,,Italy,,University,Science

Using effective MPAs with four or five key features as an unfished standard, comparisons of underwater survey data from effective MPAs with predictions based on survey data from fished coasts indicate that total fish biomass has declined about two-thirds from historical baselines as a result of fishing. Effective MPAs also had twice as many large (> 250 mm total length) fish species per transect, five times more large fish biomass, and fourteen times more shark biomass than fished areas. Most (59%) of the MPAs studied had only one or two key features and were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites.

We demonstrated that specific age groups of Atlantic cod and pouting are seasonally attracted towards the WARs, that they show high site fidelity and feed upon the dominant epifaunal prey species present.

The southern Ionian Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea and the eastern-central Tyrrhenian Sea resulted to be the areas most affected by alien molluscan introductions. The rate of records of new alien species (evaluated on the basis of live findings) is quite uniform over five decades, with six to eight species recorded per decade. The analysis of the vectors showed shipping/maritime transport to be the most common vector of introduction (40%), followed by trade (24%).

They are focal points for global marine conservation because they occur in regions where human populations are rapidly expanding. Our review of 11 TMSs focuses on three key ecosystems—coral reefs and emergent atolls, deep benthic systems, and pelagic biomes—and synthesizes, illustrates, and contrasts knowledge of biodiversity, ecosystem function, interaction between adjacent habitats, and anthropogenic pressures. TMSs vary in the extent that they have been subject to human influence—from the nearly pristine Coral Sea to the heavily exploited South China and Caribbean Seas—but we predict that they will all be similarly complex to manage because most span multiple national jurisdictions.

The Coral Triangle (CT) Atlas was developed to provide scientists and managers with the best available data on marine resources in the Coral Triangle. Endorsed as an official supporting tool to the Coral Triangle Initiative, the CT Atlas strives to provide the most accurate information possible to track the success of the conservation efforts of the Initiative. Focusing on marine protected areas and key marine habitats, the CT Atlas tested a process to assess the quality, reliability, and accuracy of different data layers. This article describes the mechanism used to evaluate these layers and to provide accurate data. Results of the preliminary quality control process showed errors in reputable datasets, outdated and missing data, metadata gaps, and a lack of user instructions to interpret layers. It highlighted the need to challenge existing datasets and demonstrated that regional efforts could improve the data available to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures.

More than 1,900 MPAs covering 200,881 km<sup>2</sup> (1.6% of the exclusive economic zone for the region) have been established within these countries over the last 40 years under legal mandates that range from village level traditional law to national legal frameworks that mandate the protection of large areas as MPAs. The focus of protection has been primarily on critical marine habitats and ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on maintaining and improving the status of near-shore fisheries, a primary food and economic resource in the region. This article brings together for the first time a consistent set of current data on MPAs for the six countries and reviews progress toward the establishment of MPAs in these countries with regard to (i) coverage of critical habitat (e.g., 17.8% of the coral reef habitat within the region lies within an MPA), (ii) areas under effective management, and (iii) actions needed to improve the implementation of MPAs as a marine conservation and resource management strategy. The contribution of MPAs to the Coral Triangle MPA System as called for in the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security Regional Plan of Action is clarified. Options for scaling up existing MPAs to networks of MPAs that are more ecologically linked and integrated with fisheries management and responsive to changing climate through the Coral Triangle MPA System development are discussed. A key point is the need to improve the effectiveness of existing MPAs, and plan in a manner leading to ecosystem-based management.","White, A.T.; Aliño, P.M.; Cros, A.; Fatan, N.A.; Green, A.L.; Teoh, S.J.; Laroya, L.; Peterson, N.; Tan, S.; Tighe, S.; Venegas-Li, R.; Walton, A.; Wen, W.",WOS:000331332000002,"Teoh, Shwu Jiau, S.J.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1080/08920753.2014.878177,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Coastal management,, Coral Triangle countries;  Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning,"Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, 923 Nuuanu Ave, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA.",USA,coastal management; Coral Triangle countries; marine protected areas; marine spatial planning,COASTAL FISHERIES; MANAGEMENT; PHILIPPINES; NETWORKS; RESERVES; LESSONS; DECLINE; REEFS,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,The Nature Conservancy,x,USA,,Non-profit organization,Civil society

To begin with, there is little research that categorizes the typologies of regulatory capture despite the ubiquity of the phenomenon. After a discussion of theoretical approaches to regulatory capture, I describe the operative definition and theory appropriate to the situation related to authorization of oil and natural gas production in Israel following the discovery of large offshore reserves in 2010. This approach, embodying several facets of existing typologies, is applied to decisions made authorizing construction of the Gabriella offshore exploratory drilling platform. The analysis highlights the nature of capture in the absence of clear agency jurisdiction over new activities located in offshore environs organized as temporal and spatial “vacuums”. I conclude that comprehensive marine spatial planning would result in less capture and the development of more capture-resistant regulations.","Portman, M.E.",WOS:000330813800005,"Portman, Michelle, M.E.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,Regulatory capture;  Offshore gas drilling; Temporal and spatial vacuums;  Marine spatial planning,"Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel.",Israel,Regulatory capture; Offshore gas drilling; Temporal and spatial vacuums; Marine spatial planning,AGENCIES; POWER,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) - Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning,x,Israel,,University,Science

The paper concludes by arguing that the US strategy implies a policing approach that generates maritime surveillance capacities along land–sea lanes of communication.

Here we report the discovery of a fungus-related parasitic microsporidium, <i>Nematocenator marisprofundi</i> n. gen. n. sp. that infects benthic nematodes at methane seeps on the Pacific Ocean floor. This infection is species-specific and has been temporally and spatially stable over 2 years of sampling, indicating an ecologically consistent host-parasite interaction. A high distribution of spores in the reproductive tracts of infected males and females and their absence from host nematodes' intestines suggests a sexual transmission strategy in contrast to the fecal-oral transmission of most microsporidia. <i>N. marisprofundi</i> targets the host's body wall muscles causing cell lysis, and in severe infection even muscle filament degradation. Phylogenetic analyses placed <i>N. marisprofundi</i> in a novel and basal clade not closely related to any described microsporidia clade, suggesting either that microsporidia-nematode parasitism occurred early in microsporidia evolution or that host specialization occurred late in an ancient deep-sea microsporidian lineage.

Using new and already published data, the meiofauna standing stocks (abundance and biomass) and nematode structural and functional diversity were investigated in relation to the sediment biogeochemistry (e.g. organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments) and grain size. A conspicuous increase in sand content from 2005 to 2006 and decrease of phytodetritus at both sites, suggested the occurrence of one or more physical disturbance events. Nematode standing stocks and trophic diversity decreased after these events, seemingly followed by a recovery/recolonisation period in 2007, which was strongly correlated with an increase in the quantity and bioavailability of phytodetrital organic matter supplied. Changes in meiofauna assemblages, however, also differed between stations, likely because of the contrasting hydrodynamic and food supply conditions. Higher meiofauna and nematode abundances, biomass and trophic complexity were found at the shallowest canyon station, where the quantity, quality and bioavailability of food material were higher than at the deeper site.

Among the major groups of preys found in the diet of <i>E. spinax</i>, we identified three potential sources of luciferin: the euphausiid <i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i> Sars, 1857 (tetrapyrrole luciferin), the shrimp <i>Pasiphaea multidentata</i> Esmark, 1866 (coelenterazine) and the teleost <i>Maurolicus muelleri</i> Gmelin, 1789 (coelenterazine). Their luciferins were tested for their presence in the digestive tract and photogenic organs of <i>E. spinax</i> as well as for their cross-reaction with a putative shark catalyst.

In situ quantification of bioturbation can be achieved in a myriad of ways, requiring expert knowledge, technology, and resources not always available, and not feasible in some settings. Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BP<sub>c</sub>). This index can be calculated from inventories of species, abundance and biomass data (routinely available for many systems), and a functional classification of organism traits associated with sediment mixing (less available). Presently, however, there is no agreed standard categorization for the reworking mode and mobility of benthic species. Based on information from the literature and expert opinion, we provide a functional classification for 1033 benthic invertebrate species from the northwest European continental shelf, as a tool to enable the standardized calculation of BP<sub>c</sub> in the region. Future uses of this classification table will increase the comparability and utility of large-scale assessments of ecosystem processes and functioning influenced by bioturbation (e.g., to support legislation). The key strengths, assumptions, and limitations of BP<sub>c</sub> as a metric are critically reviewed, offering guidelines for its calculation and application.","Queiros, A.M.; Birchenough, S.N.R.; Bremner, J.; Godbold, J.A.; Parker, R.E.; Romero-Ramirez, A.; Reiss, H.; Solan, M.; Somerfield, P.J.; Van Colen, C.; Van Hoey, G.; Widdicombe, S.",WOS:000325486000025,"Queiros, A.M.","PlymouthMarine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.769,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Biodiversity; biogeochemical; ecosystem function; functional group; goodenvironmental status; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; process;trait,"Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",England,Biodiversity; biogeochemical; ecosystem function; functional group; good environmental status; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; process; trait,SEDIMENT REWORKING; FRESH-WATER; IMPACT; DISTURBANCE; TRAITS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML),,UK,,Research institute,Science

The knowledge of the spatial variability of deep-sea biodiversity is one of the main challenges of marine ecology and evolutionary biology. The choice of the observational spatial scale is assumed to play a key role for understanding processes structuring the deep-sea benthic communities and one of the most typical features of marine biodiversity distribution is the existence of bathymetric gradients. However, the analysis of biodiversity bathymetric gradients and the associated changes in species composition (beta diversity) typically compared large depth ranges (with intervals of 500 to 1000 or even 2000 m depth among sites). To test whether significant changes in alpha and beta diversity occur also at fine-scale bathymetric gradients (i.e., within few hundred-meter depth intervals) the variability of deep-sea nematode biodiversity and assemblage composition along a bathymetric transect (200-1200 m depth) with intervals of 200 m among sampling depths, was investigated. A hierarchical sampling strategy for the analysis of nematode species richness, beta diversity, functional (trophic) diversity, and related environmental variables, was used. The results indicate the lack of significant differences in taxonomic and functional diversity across sampling depths, but the presence of high beta diversity at all spatial scales investigated: between cores collected from the same box corer (on average 56%), among deployments at the same depth (58%), and between all sampling depths (62%). Such high beta diversity is influenced by the presence of small-scale patchiness in the deep sea and is also related to the large number of rare or very rare species (typically accounting for > 80% of total species richness). Moreover, the number of ubiquitous nematode species across all sampling depths is quite low (ca. 15%). Multiple regression analyses provide evidence that such patterns could be related to the different availability, composition and size spectra of food particles in the sediments. Additionally, though to a lesser extent, our results indicate, that selective predation can influence the nematode trophic composition. These findings suggest that a multiple scale analysis based on a nested sampling design could significantly improve our knowledge of bathymetric patterns of deepsea biodiversity and its drivers.","Danovaro, R.; Carugati, L.; Corinaldesi, C.; Gambi, C.; Guilini, K.; Pusceddu, A.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000321177000012,"Guilini, Katja, K.","Ghent University, Department Biology, Marine Biology Research Group",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.035,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Deep-sea biodiversity; Bathymetric patterns; Deep-sea nematodes</td>,"Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Via Brecce Blanche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",Italy,Deep-sea biodiversity; Bathymetric patterns; Deep-sea nematodes,PARTICLE-SIZE DIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; HABITAT HETEROGENEITY; BENTHIC BIODIVERSITY; MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; MARINE NEMATODES; NORTH-ATLANTIC; SEDIMENTS; ECOLOGY,Oceanography,Oceanography,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Differences in density between beaches, tidal level and seasons, and nematode community structure were investigated. Sediments from both beaches were composed of medium to very coarse sand. The highest nematode densities were found at the UTL, and significant differences between beaches, tidal levels and months were found. A total of 54 genera were found and the genera composition on both sheltered beaches was similar to other exposed worldwide sandy beaches. The density and structure of the nematode community at both beaches clearly varied along the spatial and temporal scales.

It has been argued that as a result of nematodes being small in size and lacking pelagic larvae, it is unlikely that they are able to disperse actively over wide geographical ranges. Nematode dispersal is therefore assumed to be predominantly driven by water currents entraining resuspended sediments containing nematodes. Three different types of substrates combined with sediment (algae, bacteria, and sulphides) and two different controls (empty and azoic sediment) were offered to a nematode community sinking through the water column in three independent, simultaneously running replicated experiments. Selective settlement of nematodes was observed whilst descending in the water column under ex-situ experimental conditions using samples collected in the Whittard canyon at 812 m of water depth. Significant differences in nematode community structure between treatments suggest that different nematodes are attracted by different substrates. They may colonise suitable patches selectively when descending in the water column, but whether they are attracted by food or by other attractants, such as pheromones or other chemical signals, is still unclear. High abundances of the chemosynthetic, mouthless nematode <i>Astomonema</i> found in the canyon study area over medium-scale distances (10-100 m) contribute to the idea that resuspension events enable dispersal of nematodes over larger distances, after which active settlement can occur through chemical attraction.","Lins, L.; Vanreusel, A.; Van Campenhout, J.; Ingels, J.",WOS:000316715000015,"Ingels, Jeroen, J.","Marine Biology Department, Ghent University",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2013.01.021,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Nematoda,,,Deep sea; Nematodes; Resuspension; Settlement</td>,"Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,Deep sea; Nematodes; Resuspension; Settlement,FREE-LIVING MARINE; ORGANIC-MATTER; ESTUARINE NEMATODES; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; FEEDING ECOLOGY; MEIOFAUNA; DISPERSAL; COLONIZATION; FOOD; HETEROGENEITY,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

It is assumed that light in marine invertebrates mainly plays a role of defense against predation, and many mechanisms of defense have been proposed for brittle stars. We investigated the potential functions of startle effect (use of light to deter predator), use of light to advertise a predator that the prey is toxic (aposematic signal) and attraction of a secondary predator (function usually called ""burglar-alarm effect""). Predatory experiments, involving one or two predators from different trophic levels allowed us determining benefits of the light emission for several brittle star species.

For the deep sea, there is evidence that structural and functional characteristics of benthic communities are regulated by a multitude of biotic and environmental processes that act in concert on different spatial scales, but the spatial patterns are poorly understood compared to those for terrestrial ecosystems. Deep-sea studies generally focus on very limited scale ranges, thereby impairing our understanding of which spatial scales and associated processes are most important in driving structural and functional diversity of communities. Here, we used an extensive integrated dataset of free-living nematodes from deep-sea sediments to unravel the importance of different spatial scales in determining benthic infauna communities. Multiple-factor multivariate permutational analyses were performed on different sets of community descriptors (structure, structural and functional diversity, standing stock). The different spatial scales investigated cover two margins in the northeast Atlantic, several submarine canyons/channel/slope areas, a bathymetrical range of 700-4300 m, different sampling locations at each station, and vertical sediment profiles. The results indicated that the most important spatial scale for structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability is the smallest one; infauna communities changed substantially more with differences between sediment depth layers than with differences associated to larger geographical or bathymetrical scales. Community structure differences were greatest between stations at both margins. Important regulating ecosystem processes and the scale on which they occur are discussed. The results imply that, if we are to improve our understanding of ecosystem patterns of deep-sea infauna and the relevant processes driving their structure, structural and functional diversity, and standing stock, we must pay particular attention to the small-scale heterogeneity or patchiness and the causative mechanisms acting on that scale.","Ingels, J.; Vanreusel, A.",WOS:000322242700010,"Ingels, J.","Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",https://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-4547-2013,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,"Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Sect Marine Biol, Krijgslaan 281 S8 WE11, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,,OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE; LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY PATTERNS; RECENT SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SUBMARINE CANYONS; HABITAT HETEROGENEITY; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; NEMATODE ASSEMBLAGES; CONTRASTING SITES; CONTINENTAL-SLOPE,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML),,UK,,Research institute,Science

In southern rockhopper penguins, <i>Eudyptes chrysocome</i>, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and time–depth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds' incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.","Ludynia, K.; Dehnhard, N.; Poisbleau, M.; Demongin, L.; Masello, J.F.; Voigt, C.C.; Quillfeldt, P.",WOS:000313573200033,"Masello, J.F.","Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol &Systemat, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.11.001,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Eudyptes chrysocome,,,ecological niche model; energetic requirement; Eudyptes chrysocome;Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas; GPS logger; MaxEnt; sex-specificbehaviour; southern rockhopper penguin; spatial segregation; stableisotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classification facilitates reporting of habitat data in a comparable manner, for use in nature conservation (e.g. inventories, monitoring and assessments), habitat mapping and environmental management. For the marine environment the importance of a univocal habitat classification system is confirmed by the fact that many European initiatives, aimed at marine mapping, assessment and reporting, are increasingly using EUNIS habitat categories and respective codes. For this reason substantial efforts have been made to include information on marine benthic habitats from different regions, aiming to provide a comprehensive geographical coverage of European seas. However, there still remain many concerns on its applicability as only a small fraction of Europe's seas are fully mapped and increasing knowledge and application raise further issues to be resolved.<br>This paper presents an overview of the main discussion and conclusions of a workshop, organised by the MeshAtlantic project, focusing upon the experience in using the EUNIS habitats classification across different countries and seas, together with case studies. The aims of the meeting were to: (i) bring together scientists with exper_ience_in the use of the EUNIS marine classification and representatives from the European Environment Agency (EEA); (ii) agree on enhancements to EUNIS that ensure an improved representation of the European marine habitats; and (iii) establish practices that make marine habitat maps produced by scientists more consistent with the needs of managers and decision-makers. During the workshop challenges for the future development of EUNIS were identified, which have been classified into five categories: (1) structure and hierarchy; (2) biology; (3) terminology; (4) mapping; and (5) future development. The workshop ended with a declaration from the attendees, with recommendations to the EEA and European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity, to take into account the outputs of the workshop, which identify weaknesses in the current classification and include proposals for its modification, and to devise a process to further develop the marine component of the EUNIS habitat classification.","Galparsoro, I.; Connor, D.W.; Borja, A.; Aish, A.; Amorim, P.; Bajjouk, T.; Chambers, C.; Coggan, R.; Dirberg, G.; Ellwood, H.; Evans, D.; Goodin, K.L.; Grehan, A.; Haldin, J.; Howell, K.; Jenkins, C.; Michez, N.; Mo, G.L.; Buhl-Mortensen, P.; Pearce, B.; Populus, J.; Salomidi, M.; Sanchez, F.; Serrano, A.; Shumchenia, E.; Tempera, F.; Vasquez, M.",WOS:000313380800016,"Galparsoro, I.","AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res,Portualdea Zg 20110, Pasaia, Spain.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.10.010,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Habitat classification scheme; EUNIS; Marine habitats; Habitat mapping</td>,"AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res, Portualdea Zg 20110, Pasaia, Spain.",Spain,Habitat classification scheme; EUNIS; Marine habitats; Habitat mapping,CENTRAL ENGLISH-CHANNEL; COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY; MARINE; PATTERNS; SERVICES; ECOLOGY; SHELF; GOODS; CLEAR,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,AZTI Tecnalia,,Spain,,Research institute,Science

The complexity of the terebrid venom apparatus suggests that venom apparatus development in the Terebridae could be linked to the diversification of the group and can be analyzed within a molecular phylogenetic scaffold to better understand terebrid evolution. Presented here is a molecular phylogeny of 89 terebrid species belonging to 12 of the 15 currently accepted genera, based on Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses of amplicons of 3 mitochondrial (COI, 16S and 12S) and one nuclear (28S) genes. The evolution of the anatomy of the terebrid venom apparatus was assessed by mapping traits of six related characters: proboscis, venom gland, odontophore, accessory proboscis structure, radula, and salivary glands. A novel result concerning terebrid phylogeny was the discovery of a previously unrecognized lineage, which includes species of <i>Euterebra</i> and <i>Duplicaria</i>. The non-monophyly of most terebrid genera analyzed indicates that the current genus-level classification of the group is plagued with homoplasy and requires further taxonomic investigations. Foregut anatomy in the family Terebridae reveals an inordinate diversity of features that covers the range of variability within the entire superfamily Conoidea, and that hypodermic radulae have likely evolved independently on at least three occasions. These findings illustrate that terebrid venom apparatus evolution is not perfunctory, and involves independent and numerous changes of central features in the foregut anatomy. The multiple emergence of hypodermic marginal radular teeth in terebrids are presumably associated with variable functionalities, suggesting that terebrids have adapted to dietary changes that may have resulted from predator–prey relationships. The anatomical and phylogenetic results presented serve as a starting point to advance investigations about the role of predator–prey interactions in the diversification of the Terebridae and the impact on their peptide toxins, which are promising bioactive compounds for biomedical research and therapeutic drug development.","Castelin, M.; Puillandre, N.; Kantor, Y.I.; Modica, M.V.; Terryn, Y.; Cruaud, C.; Bouchet, P.; Holford, M.",WOS:000305035600003,"Castelin, M.","CUNY Hunter Coll, New York,NY 10065 USA.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2012.03.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,Character evolution; Key innovations; Predator-prey system; Radula;Teretoxins; Peptide toxins,"CUNY Hunter Coll, 695 Pk Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",USA,Character evolution; Key innovations; Predator-prey system; Radula; Teretoxins; Peptide toxins,LIFE-HISTORY SIMILARITIES; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; TOXIN GENES; CONUS; DIVERSITY; PROBOSCIS; SELECTION; PATTERNS,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,City University of New York (CUNY),,,,,

Most species occur in the North Atlantic, however, 16 of these species occur also in the North Pacific, a more limited number of species occurs in the South Atlantic or South Pacific The Southern Ocean displays some special zoogeographic features and 22 widespread species occur there below 2000 m, including highly eurybathic ones.

Sustainability in coastal urban environment: identifying resources and users in Belgian case study areas, <b><i>in</i></b>: Khan, A.Z. <i>et al.</i> (Ed.) <i>Sustainability in the coastal urban environment: thematic profiles of resources and their users.</i> pp. 109-146, annex","This chapter presents an overview and analysis of the various aspects of resources and users in the two Belgian cases of Oostende and Brugge. These two case study areas lie next to each other and occupy around half of the total Belgian coastal zone. The Belgian coast is a densely populated and intensely used area due to its well-established infrastructure that makes the coast easily accessible for a broad (European) hinterland. Both the Belgian cases have a larger core and ring and are famous tourist attractions. While Brugge develops based on its two main pillars of multifunctional cargo port area and its touristic heritage, Oostende relies on strong beach tourism and a port as a passenger gateway. Both cases have witnessed their strong urbanization process decades ago and their development has become stabilized during the last decade. The economies rely more and more on commerce and service sector rather than traditional industrial activities. Agriculture has reduced to a marginal role, both in term of production and in term of employment. The major users include the local inhabitants, visitors, second-home owners, and various community groups. In Brugge, the port of Zeebrugge is one of the major users as it occupies a large area, which contains also valuable nature sites as well as important road, rail and waterway links to the hinterland. In Oostende, competition at the beachfront is one of the main issues. Generally ageing population, loss of agricultural lands, slight increase of mixed-use forest and nature areas, increase in port activities and urban sprawl are some of the trends observed in both cases. The scarcity of coastal space, and its contestation by a diversity of users for competing interests [mainly economic development and environmental protection] plays a pivotal role in generating a range of conflicts.","Le, Q.X.; De Munter, K.; Crols, T.; Khan, A.Z.; Corijn, E.",,"Le, Quynh Xuan, Q.X.","COSMOPOLIS, Department of Geography, Vrije Universiteit Brussel",,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,"Brugge, Oostende, Belgian coastal areas, environmental characteristics, socioeconomic features, coastal users",,,,,,,Free University of Brussels (VUB) - Faculty of Sciences - Department of Geography - COSMOPOLIS,,,,,

We present a fossil deep-sea assemblage of echinoderms, gastropods, brachiopods and ostracods, from the Early Jurassic of the Glasenbach Gorge, Austria, which includes the oldest known representatives of a number of extant deep-sea groups, and thus implies that in situ diversification, in contrast to immigration from shelf habitats, played a much greater role in shaping modern deep-sea biodiversity than previously thought. A comparison with coeval shelf assemblages reveals that, at least in some of the analysed groups, significantly more extant families/superfamilies have endured in the deep sea since the Early Jurassic than in the shelf seas, which suggests that deep-sea biota are more resilient against extinction than shallow-water ones. In addition, a number of extant deep-sea families/superfamilies found in the Glasenbach assemblage lack post-Jurassic shelf occurrences, implying that if there was a complete extinction of the deep-sea fauna followed by replacement from the shelf, it must have happened before the Late Jurassic.

It is the combination of a particular methodology, based on the minimisation of a cost function, and a numerically efficient method, based on a finite-element solver. The cost function penalises the misfit between the observations and the reconstructed field, as well as the regularity or smoothness of the field. The method bears similarities to the smoothing splines, where the second derivatives of the field are also penalised.<br>The intrinsic advantages of the method are its natural way to take into account topographic and dynamic constraints (coasts, advection, etc.) and its capacity to handle large data sets, frequently encountered in oceanography. The method provides gridded fields in two dimensions, usually in horizontal layers. Three-dimension fields are obtained by stacking horizontal layers.<br>In the present work, we summarize the background of the method and describe the possible methods to compute the error field associated to the analysis. In particular, we present new developments leading to a more consistent error estimation, by determining numerically the real covariance function in DIVA, which is never formulated explicitly, contrarily to Optimal Interpolation. The real covariance function is obtained by two concurrent executions of DIVA, the first providing the covariance for the second. With this improvement, the error field is now perfectly consistent with the inherent background covariance in all cases.<br>A two-dimension application using salinity measurements in the Mediterranean Sea is presented. Applied on these measurements, Optimal Interpolation and DIVA provided very similar gridded fields (correlation: 98.6%, RMS of the difference: 0.02).

Specifically at the beaches, predictions on sea-level rise, storms and flood risk from the North Sea have led to several big coastal defence projects. Management of sandy beaches is therefore a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined and where biodiversity should be taken into account.In this study, the biological value of the shallow Belgian coastal zone was derived based on a detailed and integrated dataset (1995–2011) of all available ecological information on macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos and birds. The 67 km Belgian coastline was divided into an across-shore intertidal and shallow subtidal subzone, and into along-shore subzones of 250 m for benthic components and 3 km for birds. The intrinsic biological value of each subzone was then calculated using the biological valuation method, and the pertained score, ranging from very low to very high, was plotted accordingly in order to obtain a marine biological valuation map.Following trends were detected: (1) a strong mosaic pattern of biological value along the coastline; (2) a clear lack of (benthic) data at the eastern part of the Belgian coast; (3) a rather high biological value in around 70% of the shallow subtidal subzones, compared to the intertidal part; and (4) a high/very high biological value in intertidal zones located immediately to the east of the harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende and Zeebrugge.A detailed analysis of protected areas and areas under coastal flood risk indicated that biological valuation maps are very promising management tools for local decision-makers as they allow for an early integration of ‘natural/ecological values’ in policy implementation.","Vanden Eede, S.; Laporta, L.; Deneudt, K.; Stienen, E.; Derous, S.; Degraer, S.; Vincx, M.",WOS:000339534800007,"Vanden Eede, Sarah, S.","Ghent University, Department of Biology, Marine Biology Section",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.04.022,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Belgian Coast,,Spatial planning,,Marine spatial planning; biological valuation,"Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,,LANICE-CONCHILEGA; GREY DUNES; ECOSYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; SEA; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SERVICES; DEFINITION; ECOLOGY,Oceanography; Water Resources,Oceanography; Water Resources,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Significant recent advances have been enabled by various factors, including the establishment of two IGCP projects and the realisation of several IODP expeditions. Contourites were first described in the Northern and Southern Atlantic Ocean, and since then, have been discovered in every major ocean basin and even in lakes. The 120 major contourite areas presently known are associated to myriad oceanographic processes in surface, intermediate and deep-water masses. The increasing recognition of these deposits is influencing palaeoclimatology & palaeoceanography, slope-stability/geological hazard assessment, and hydrocarbon exploration. Nevertheless, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the sedimentological and oceanographic processes governing contourites, which involve dense bottom currents, tides, eddies, deep-sea storms, internal waves and tsunamis. Furthermore, in light of the latest knowledge on oceanographic processes and other governing factors (e.g. sediment supply and sea-level), existing facies models must now be revised. Persistent oceanographic processes significantly affect the seafloor, resulting in large-scale depositional and erosional features. Various classifications have been proposed to subdivide a continuous spectrum of partly overlapping features. Although much progress has been made in the large-scale, geophysically based recognition of these deposits, there remains a lack of unambiguous and commonly accepted diagnostic criteria for deciphering the small-scaled contourite facies and for distinguishing them from turbidite ones. Similarly, the study of sandy deposits generated or affected by bottom currents, which is still in its infancy, offers great research potential: these deposits might prove invaluable as future reservoir targets. Expectations for the forthcoming analysis of data from the IODP Expedition 339 are high, as this work promises to tackle much of the aforementioned lack of knowledge. In the near future, geologists, oceanographers and benthic biologists will have to work in concert to achieve synergy in contourite research to demonstrate the importance of bottom currents in continental margin sedimentation and evolution.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-SA license(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).","Rebesco, M.; Hernández-Molina, F.J.; Van Rooij, D.; Wåhlin, A.",WOS:000338802700008,"Van Rooij, D.","Ghent University, Renard Centre of Marine Geology, Geology & Soil Science",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.margeo.2014.03.011,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,,,    contourite;     oceanographic process;     sedimentary drift;     bedform;     sedimentary structure;     facies model,,,,,,,Ghent University - Renard Centre of Marine Geology,x,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Bacteria were the dominant prokaryote component and Archaea formed a considerable fraction (20%-30%) of the prokaryote assemblages. The meio- and macrofauna abundances and meiofauna biomass did not decrease significantly with depth but macrofauna biomass did. The a diversity did not follow a clear bathymetric trend for both nematode and macrofauna species. Probably because of the large number of eurybathic nematode genera, nor did the turnover diversity in nematode composition change down the depth gradient. Conversely, for the macrofauna there was a perceptible change in community composition between the shallowest station and the two deeper stations. Food availability affected only the macrobenthic component. The increase in the prokaryote organisms with depth and the dominance of nematodes and macrofauna deposit feeders suggest active grazing by the two benthic components on microbes.

Some of these include human population growth, coastal urbanization, accelerated human activities, and climate change. To enhance the formation of a science-based system of marine protected areas in the Mediterranean Sea, data on the spatial distribution of ecological features (abiotic variables, species, communities, habitats, and ecosystems) is required to inform conservation scientists and planners. However, the spatial data required is often lacking. In this review, we aimed to address the status of our knowledge for 3 major types of spatial information: bathymetry, classification of marine habitats, and species distributions. To exemplify the data gaps and approaches to bridge them, we examined case studies that systematically prioritize conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that at present the data required for conservation planning is generally more readily available and of better quality for the European countries located in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the Mediterranean Sea is lagging behind other marine regions where rigorous criteria for conservation planning has been applied in the past 20 yr. Therefore, we call upon scientists, governments, and international governmental and non-governmental organizations to harmonize current approaches in marine mapping and to develop a framework that is applicable throughout the Mediterranean region. Such coordination between stakeholders is urgently needed before more countries undertake further extensive habitat mapping, so that future conservation planning can use integrated spatial datasets.","Levin, N.; Coll, M.; Fraschetti, S.; Gal, G.; Giakoumi, S.; Göke, C.; Heymans, J.J.; Katsanevakis, S.; Mazor, T.; Öztürk, B.; Rilov, G.; Gajewski, J.; Steenbeek, J.; Kark, S.",WOS:000341168300020,"Coll, Marta, M.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.3354/meps10857,,"EUROBIS ackn - direct reference, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",Mediterranean,,"Bathymetry, ""Biodiversity"", ""Habitats"", ""Spatial data""",, Conservation planning,"Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Mt Scopus, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",Israel,Conservation planning; Mediterranean Sea; Biodiversity; Habitats; Bathymetry; Spatial data,MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; SOCIOECONOMIC DATA; MAPPING TECHNIQUES; BENTHIC ECOLOGY; HABITAT; COASTAL; MANAGEMENT; FISH,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Department of Geography,x,Israel,,University,Science

The first reserve was proposed in 1965 and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even one instance proves that such things are possible.    All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be expected.    Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs), cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long Bay).    Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both scientific theory and practical politics.    When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change, due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades. The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing directly and indirectly alters ecosystems.    The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to fishing and other human activities.    The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest.    The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining.    Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in Australia and the USA.

By doing so, they affect their own distribution and that of other species, which can influence community composition. Moreover, by affecting the abiotic environment and species distribution, ecosystem engineers can also affect the number and strength of biotic interactions among species, such as predation and competition. Together with the notion that engineering effects often persist on long time and large spatial scales, this leads to the suggestion that ecosystem engineers have the potential to alter the structure and dynamics of ecological interaction networks in space and time. In soft-bottom intertidal ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’ Arguin, the group of ecosystem engineers that provide structure such as reef-building bivalves and seagrasses, can have a significant impact on the associated community, since natural ‘hard’ substrate and structure are almost exclusively provided by these species in the otherwise sandy environment. Unfortunately, soft-bottom coastal ecosystems have become severely degraded worldwide during the last centuries due to human impacts and most ecosystem engineers in these systems have strongly declined, with potentially dramatic implications for associated species, community structure and overall biodiversity. The main objective of this thesis is to empirically investigate how and to what extent ecosystem engineers affect the (trophic) structure and dynamics of intertidal soft-bottom communities. Hence, this thesis provides a better understanding of the role of ecosystem engineers in assembling and structuring ecological interaction networks and their importance for effective conservation management of coastal ecosystems. In chapter 2 and 3, we demonstrate that ecosystem engineering effects of reefbuilding bivalves are spatially extended and act on multiple trophic levels. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, transects across three mussel reefs and three nearby sandy areas without reefs showed a peak in cockle densities at ~100 meters coastward from the mussel reef, while cockle abundances within the reefs and in the nearby sandy areas were very low. Additionally, transplantation of tagged cockles showed higher survival of cockles and higher juvenile cockle densities in the area close to the mussel reef compared to areas without mussels, whereas cockle growth was lower close to the reef. This spatial pattern was caused by scale-dependent effects of mussel reefs: in the mussel-reef, cockle survival was reduced by deteriorated sediment conditions through biodeposition and by algal depletion, while further away from the mussel reefs, cockle survival was facilitated due to the reduction of water flow velocity. Next, we demonstrate with a field survey that a comparable spatial pattern is visible in other benthic species and that these effects on their spatial distribution cascade through multiple trophic levels. Distance from the reef,  sediment properties and benthic food abundance simultaneously explained significant parts of the distribution of Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus), Eurasian Curlews (Numenius arquata) and Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica), with higher densities of these shorebirds in the surrounding area of the reef compared to sandy un-engineered tidal flats. Results from these two chapters were then used to develop an experiment to investigate the interactive role of ecosystem engineering, predation and competition in structuring an intertidal bivalve population in the Wadden Sea (chapter 4). In a predator-exclosure experiment, we manipulated cockle densities (100 vs. 1000 individuals m-2) and shorebird predation at a site engineered by a blue mussel bed (Mytilus edulis) and at a sandy control site. We conclude that cockles are caught in the middle. Ecosystem engineering by mussel beds can enhance cockle densities by reducing hydrodynamic stress and predation across different life stages, but can reduce cockle growth by reducing seawater flow and by affecting inter-specific competition for food. This study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem engineers in structuring intertidal communities and the necessity to integrate multiple interaction types into a single framework. In chapter 5, we empirically tested the hypothesis that recovery of aboveground structure and stable sediments provided by ecosystem engineers facilitates the intertidal benthic community by influencing species composition and trophic structure. In a large-scale experiment at two different sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea (West vs. East), we applied anti-erosion mats and added adult mussels to test for the effects of sediment stabilization and habitat modification, respectively. The antierosion mats mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the infaunal community, while the addition of mussels mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity of the epifaunal community, irrespective of location. In this chapter, we conclude that structure-providing and sediment-stabilizing species such as mussels play an important role in facilitating the benthic community throughout the Wadden Sea by influencing species composition and trophic structure. On top of this large-scale experiment, the interactive effects of ecosystem engineering and predation on bivalve recruitment were investigated (chapter 6). Results show that both adult mussels and the anti-erosion mat facilitated epibenthic mussel recruits, whereas three other endobenthic bivalve species were facilitated by the mat, but inhibited by mussels. However, these observed facilitation and inhibition effects, only emerged when predators were excluded, demonstrating strong interactive effects between ecosystem engineering and predation. Our findings suggest that loss of ecosystem engineers and disturbance of trophic interactions can strongly hinder bivalve recruitment in coastal ecosystems. Finally, the effects of ecosystem engineering by seagrass and burrowing crabs on food web assembly were studied (chapter 7). Using a unique combination of remote sensing, field surveys, and stable isotopes, we reveal that hierarchical habitat modification by seagrasses and burrowing crabs transform simple intertidal food webs into a complex mosaic of linked inter- and subtidal food webs over long timescales. We found that seagrass and burrowing crabs dramatically alter food web structure, composition and its temporal development by accumulating silt and creating large intertidal pools in the accumulated silt layer, respectively. Our empirical findings show that ecosystem engineering is strongly interwoven with trophic networks by changing food web composition over time. Concluding, results presented in this thesis demonstrate that ecosystem engineering can strongly affect the trophic structure and dynamics of intertidal communities and that ecosystem engineers have a much larger ecological impact on the intertidal community than their actual size and lifespan suggests. Ecosystem engineers in intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems are therefore appealing conservation targets because by managing a single species, entire communities can be positively affected. Nevertheless, findings in this thesis also illustrate that ecosystem engineering are often entangled in a network of multiple interaction types, illustrating that conservation and restoration efforts should focus on multiple species within an integrated network of interaction types. Additionally, due to long-term and large-scale dynamics characterizing ecosystems like the Wadden Sea and the Banc d’Arguin, it is expected that only long-term and large-scale management approaches, such as prolonged closure of large parts to industrial fisheries and mechanical dredging, will be successful in order to restore and protect the unique values of these important intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems.","van der Zee., E.M.",,"van der Zee., Elsbeth Merith, E.M.",,http://hdl.handle.net/11370/9c42ae3f-9175-45da-9f1f-4637ea9f850e,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to gain insights into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (<em>Coryphaena hippurus</em>; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16,610 sharks were observed caught, with 11,166 identified to species level. Of these, 70.6% were blue sharks (<em>Prionace glauca)</em>, 28.4% short-fin mako sharks (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>), and 1% were other species (including thresher (<em>Alopias vulpinus</em>), hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna zygaena</em>), porbeagle (<em>Lamnus nasus</em>), and other Carcharhinidae species (<em>Carcharhinus brachyurus</em>,<em> Carcharhinus falciformis</em>,<em> Galeorhinus galeus</em>).

An average of 83.7% of sharks caught (74.7% blue sharks; 93.3% mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods.","Doherty, P.D.; Alfaro-Shigueto, J.; Hodgson, D.J.; Mangel, J.C.; Witt, M.J.; Godley, B.J.",WOS:000337738800006,"Doherty, Philip, P.D.","Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Sch Biosci, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1002/ece3.1104,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Peru,,"Conservation, ""Sharks"", ""Sustainability""",,CPUE; Small-scale fisheries,"Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Sch Biosci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",England,Conservation; CPUE; Peru; sharks; small-scale fisheries; sustainability,ISURUS-OXYRINCHUS; PRIONACE-GLAUCA; PELAGIC SHARKS; BYCATCH; FISH; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; COLLAPSE; IMPACTS,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,University of Exeter,,UK,,University,Science

The islands and atolls (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno, and Pitcairn) are situated in the central South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and South America. We surveyed algae, corals, mobile invertebrates, and fishes at 97 sites between 5 and 30 m depth, and found 51 new records for algae, 23 for corals, and 15 for fishes. The structure of the ecological communities was correlated with age, isolation, and geomorphology of the four islands. Coral and algal assemblages were significantly different among islands with Ducie having the highest coral cover (56%) and Pitcairn dominated by erect macroalgae (42%). Fish biomass was dominated by top predators at Ducie (62% of total fish biomass) and at Henderson (35%). Herbivorous fishes dominated at Pitcairn, while Oeno showed a balanced fish trophic structure. We found high levels of regional endemism in the fish assemblages across the islands (45%), with the highest level observed at Ducie (56% by number). We conducted the first surveys of the deep habitats around the Pitcairn Islands using drop-cameras at 21 sites from depths of 78 to 1,585 m. We observed 57 fish species from the drop-cams, including rare species such as the false catshark (<em>Pseudotriakis microdon</em>) and several new undescribed species. In addition, we made observations of typically shallow reef sharks and other reef fishes at depths down to 300 m. Our findings highlight the uniqueness and high biodiversity value of the Pitcairn Islands as one of the least impacted in the Pacific, and suggest the need for immediate protection.","Friedlander, A.M.; Caselle, J.E.; Ballesteros, E.; Brown, E.K.; Turchik, A.; Sala, E.",WOS:000338709500030,"Friedlander, Alan, A.M.","Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",https://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0100142,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",Pitcairn I.,,,,,"Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",USA,,HENDERSON ISLAND; ALGAL FLORA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; PHAEOPHYCEAE; EXTINCTION; FISHES; IMPACT; LIMITS; ATOLL,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,National Geographic Society (NGS),,USA,,Non-profit organization,Civil society

The time series is analysed using Similarities Profiles (SIMPROF) tests and associated methods. Q-mode analysis using clustering with Type 1 SIMPROF addresses multivariate structure among samples, showing that there is clear structure associated with differences among years. Inverse (r-mode) analysis using Type 2 SIMPROF decisively rejects a hypothesis that species are not associated with each other. Clustering of the variables (species) with Type 3 SIMPROF identifies groups of species which covary coherently through the time-series. The time-series is characterised by a dramatic decline in abundances and diversity between the 1993 and 1996 surveys. By 1998 there had been a shift in community composition from the 1993 situation, with different species dominating. Communities had recovered in terms of abundance and species richness, but different species dominated the community. No single factor could be identified which unequivocally explained the dramatic changes observed in the SMNR. Possible causes were the effects of dispersed oil and dispersants from the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996 and the cessation of dredge-spoil disposal off St Annes Head in 1995, but the most likely cause was severe weather. With many species, and a demonstrable recovery from an impact, communities within the SMNR appear to be diverse and resilient.

To understand the importance of discards for local L. argentatus and <i>L. fuscus</i> populations, single-item discard experiments were performed at four offshore distances from the gullery of the Port of Zeebrugge, at four different stages of the breeding season (May to August 2011). We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11-year (2002–2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick rearing stage. A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flatfish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consumption between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer. Nutrient requirements of breeding adults peak during the chick rearing stage, making this a key period in terms of dependence of the breeding parents on discarded fish as food source.","Sotillo, A.; Depestele, J.; Courtens, W.; Vincx, M.; Stienen, E.W.M.",WOS:000346536800009,"Sotillo, Alejandro, A.",Marine Biology Section – Ghent University,https://hdl.handle.net/10.5253/arde.v102i2.a9,,"Lifewatch acknowledged, ""LifeWatch Observatory""",North Sea,"Larus argentatus Pontoppidan, 1763, ""Larus fuscus Linnaeus, 1758""",Fisheries,,Discards; Scavenging gulls; Flock composition,"Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Sect, Krijgslaan 281,Campus Sterre S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Belgium,fisheries; discards; scavenging gulls; North Sea; flock composition; Larus argentatus; Larus fuscus,NORTH-SEA; COMMERCIAL FISHERIES; SEABIRD COMMUNITIES; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; TRAWLER DISCARDS; FISHING VESSELS; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION; ECOLOGY,Ornithology,Zoology,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Marine Biology (MARBIOL),,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

U.S.A. 111(51)</i>: 18150-18155","Increasing global temperature and sea-level rise have led to concern about expansions in the distribution and prevalence of complex-lifecycle parasites (CLPs). Indeed, numerous environmental variables can influence the infectivity and reproductive output of many pathogens. Digenean trematodes are CLPs with intermediate invertebrate and definitive vertebrate hosts. Global warming and sea level rise may affect these hosts to varying degrees, and the effect of increasing temperature on parasite prevalence has proven to be nonlinear and difficult to predict. Projecting the response of parasites to anthropogenic climate change is vital for human health, and a longer term perspective (10<sup>4</sup> y) offered by the subfossil record is necessary to complement the experimental and historical approaches of shorter temporal duration (10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> y). We demonstrate, using a high-resolution 9,600-y record of trematode parasite traces in bivalve hosts from the Holocene Pearl River Delta, that prevalence was significantly higher during the earliest stages of sea level rise, significantly lower during the maximum transgression, and statistically indistinguishable in the other stages of sea-level rise and delta progradation. This stratigraphic paleobiological pattern represents the only long-term high-resolution record of pathogen response to global change, is consistent with fossil and recent data from other marine basins, and is instructive regarding the future of disease. We predict an increase in trematode prevalence concurrent with anthropogenic warming and marine transgression, with negative implications for estuarine macrobenthos, marine fisheries, and human health.","Huntley, J.W.; Fürsich, F.T.; Alberti, M.; Hethke, M.; Liu, C.",WOS:000346767200033,"Fürsich, Franz T., F.T.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.1416747111,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mollusca,,,parasites     disease     global warming     paleoecology     mollusks,"Univ Missouri, Dept Geol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",USA,parasites; disease; global warming; paleoecology; mollusks,PEARL RIVER DELTA; REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; TEMPERATURE; EMERGENCE; SCHISTOSOMIASIS; EVOLUTIONARY; MOLLUSK; ECOLOGY,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,University of Missouri,x,USA,,University,Science

No database currently exists that can claim to host, and make available in a seamless way, all the species occurrence data needed by the ecology scientific community. Occurrence data are scattered among several databases and information systems. It is not easy to retrieve records from them, because of differences in the adopted protocols, formats and granularity. Once collected, datasets have to be selected, homogenised and pre-processed before being ready-to-use in scientific analysis and modelling.

The last comprehensive review of this topic was over 25 years ago and much work has been published since. These recent studies expand the field reports of species living in hyposaline environments and detail experimental research on the responses, physiological range, and limits of echinoderms to salinity challenges. I provide a brief review of the historical concepts and measures of salinity and relate this overview to the physiological and ecological studies on echinoderms. Many marine biologists are not aware that chemical oceanographers advocate abandoning today’s commonly used measure of salinity, ‘PSU’, in favour of absolute salinity (S<sub>A</sub>)—a return to the ppt (‰) metric. The literature survey reveals only one euryhaline-tolerant species in the Southern Hemisphere (there are 42 in the North) and more euryhaline species in the geologically older, brackish seas. The green sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</i>, is one of the most tolerant echinoids to hyposalinity. Different source populations have varying levels of acclimation and tolerance to hyposalinity. Experiments show that green urchins previously unexposed to hyposalinity experience a clear decrease in growth rates; however, this adverse effect is short lived. Green urchins already acclimated to hyposalinity can endure intense and repeated bouts and grow at the same rate of urchins not exposed. Promising future work on the physiological and cellular mechanisms of hyposalinity acclimation includes comparative studies of the role of heat shock proteins in the response to changing salinities.","Russell, M.P.",WOS:000332424000003,"Russell, Michael, M.P.",,https://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/B978-0-12-408096-6.00003-1,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Echinodermata, ""Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O.F.

This has partly been due to a limited knowledge of taxonomy, the rarity of some taxa as well as extreme temporal and spatial variation in abundance of medusae. The latter may reflect the small spatial scales of many populations. Although cubozoan medusae vary greatly in size, they are all excellent swimmers and have strong orientation behaviour. This, combined with resting on the bottom for extended periods of the day in some taxa (e.g. <i>Copula sivickisi</i>), suggests that dispersal may be limited. Despite this, some taxa, such as <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i>, have broad pantropical distributions suggesting a successful phenotype and a long geologic history. Statoliths allow medusae to be aged and provide unique opportunities to obtain accurate estimates of growth and to test ecological hypotheses. The life histories of few taxa have been studied, and until recently only the life cycle of <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i> had been fully described. The ability to rear species is critical for experimentation. Further, knowledge of the ecology of cubozoans is important for understanding population dynamics and predicting risk to swimmers and prey. With the exception of worldwide occurrences, population units have not been determined using well-known tools such as comparative morphology, genetics and elemental chemistry, and this is overdue. New technology is offering exciting ways to study these elusive creatures. This, combined with experimentation, will provide a better understanding of the physical and biological factors influencing the distribution and abundance of cubozoans within and among populations, both now and under climate change.

Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records—passing a specific combination of these QC steps—is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves. Through LifeWatch, users can already upload their own data and check them against a selection of the here described quality control procedures.","Vandepitte, L.; Bosch, S.; Tyberghein, L.; Waumans, F.; Vanhoorne, B.; Hernandez, F.; De Clerck, O.; Mees, J.",WOS:000348650000001,"Mees, Jan, J.",Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),https://hdl.handle.net/10.1093/database/bau125,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""Lifewatch acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone"", ""Marine Regions acknowledged"", ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,,,,,"Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, InnovOcean Site,Wandelaarkaai 7, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Belgium,,BIODIVERSITY; STANDARD,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ),,,,,

Although several engineering species have declined dramatically in the past centuries, the consequences of their loss for the trophic structure of intertidal benthic communities remain largely unclear. In this study, we experimentally test the hypothesis that above- and belowground habitat modifications by ecosystem engineers, facilitate distinctly different, but trophically more diverse benthic communities, using intertidal mussel and tube worm beds as model systems. We constructed a large-scale experiment at two intertidal mudflats in the Dutch Wadden Sea, with distinctly different environmental conditions. At both sites, we applied anti-erosion mats to simulate belowground structure and sediment stabilization by commonly found tube worm beds and crossed this with the addition of adult mussels to investigate effects of aboveground structure. The anti-erosion mats mainly enhanced species and trophic diversity (i.e., feeding guild richness and diversity) of the infaunal community, while the addition of mussels primarily enhanced species and trophic diversity of the epifaunal community, irrespective of location. The effect size of mussel addition was larger at the exposed site in the western Wadden Sea compared to the more sheltered eastern site, probably due to relatively stronger abiotic stress alleviation. We conclude that structure-providing and sediment-stabilizing species such as reef-building bivalves and tube worms, form the foundation for trophically diverse benthic communities. In intertidal soft-bottom ecosystems like the Wadden Sea, their conservation and restoration are therefore critical for overall ecosystem functioning.","van der Zee, E.M.; Tielens, E.; Holthuijsen, S.; Donadi, S.; Eriksson, B.K.; van der Veer, H.W.; Piersma, T.; Olff, H.; van der Heide, T.",WOS:000351250600005,"Olff, Han, H.",,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.01.001,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Mytilus edulis,,,iotic structure; Ecosystem engineers; Mytilus edulis; Sediment stability; Trophic diversity; Wadden Sea,"Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Consultants, Suderwei 2, NL-9269 TZ Veenwouden, Netherlands.",Netherlands,Biotic structure; Ecosystem engineers; Mytilus edulis; Sediment stability; Trophic diversity; Wadden Sea,DUTCH WADDEN SEA; MYTILUS-EDULIS; COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; SEDIMENT STABILITY; TIDAL FLATS; MUSSEL BEDS; ENGINEERS; CONSERVATION; CONSEQUENCES; FACILITATION,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,

However, gelatinous zooplankton has been largely understudied and the absence of quantitative long-term data for the studied area impedes drawing conclusions on potential increasing densities. This study gives a comprehensive overview of the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of gelatinous zooplankton in terms of diversity and density in the Belgian part of the North Sea and the adjacent Schelde estuary, based on monthly and seasonal samples between March 2011 and February 2012. Three Scyphozoa, three Ctenophora and 27 Hydrozoa taxa were identified, including three non-indigenous species: <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>, <i>Nemopsis bachei</i> and <i>Lovenella assimilis</i>. In general, one gelatinous zooplankton assemblage was found across locations and seasons. Average gelatinous zooplankton densities reached up to 18 ind•m<sup>-3</sup> near the coast, gradually declining towards the open sea. In the brackish Schelde estuary, average densities remained below 3 ind•m<sup>-3</sup>. Highest gelatinous zooplankton densities were recorded in summer and autumn. Overall, hydromedusae were the most important group both in terms of diversity and density. The ctenophore <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> and the hydromedusa <i>Clytia</i> sp. were present in every season and at every location. Gelatinous zooplankton densities never outnumbered the non-gelatinous zooplankton densities recorded from the WP3 samples. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns seemed to be mainly driven by temperature (season) and salinity (location). Other environmental parameters including (larger) non-gelatinous zooplankton densities (as an important food source) were not retained in the most parsimonious DistLM model.In terms of population dynamics, <i>Beroe</i> sp. seemed to follow the three reproductive cycles of its prey <i>P. pileus</i> and the presence of <i>M. leidyi</i>, which were abundant in a broad size spectrum in summer and autumn. In general, gelatinous zooplankton diversity was higher, but densities were in the same order of magnitude compared to adjacent areas in the North Sea. This study provides a baseline against which a potential increase in gelatinous zooplankton in the Belgian part of the North Sea and the Schelde estuary can be measured.","Vansteenbrugge, L.; Van Regenmortel, T.; De Troch, M.; Vincx, M.; Hostens, K.",WOS:000350084100005,"Vansteenbrugge, Lies, L.","Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO), Animal Science Unit, Aquatic Environment and Quality, Bio-environmental Research Group",http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.seares.2014.12.008,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Beroe, ""Clytia"", ""Ctenophora"", ""Hydrozoa"", ""Lovenella assimilis"", ""Mnemiopsis leidyi"", ""Nemopsis bachei"", ""Scyphozoa""",,,    Jellyfish;     Scyphozoa;     Hydrozoa;     Ctenophora;     Seasonality;     Southern North Sea,"Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Anim Sci Unit, Aquat Environm & Qual Bioenvironm Res Grp, Ankerstr I, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Belgium,Jellyfish; Scyphozoa; Hydrozoa; Ctenophora; Seasonality; Southern North Sea,CTENOPHORE MNEMIOPSIS-LEIDYI; CYANEA-CAPILLATA; JELLYFISH BLOOMS; CHRYSAORA-QUINQUECIRRHA; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; AURELIA-AURITA; CNIDARIA; ABUNDANCE; WATER; TEMPERATURE,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,"ILVO Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - Animal Sciences - Aquatic Environment  and quality",,,,,

Closing the former to fishing has recently been proposed in the literature and is currently an issue of debate in various international fora. We determine the degree of overlap between fish caught in these two areas of the ocean, examine how global catch might change if catches of straddling species or taxon groups increase within EEZs as a result of protection of adjacent high seas; and identify countries that are likely to gain or lose in total catch quantity and value following high-seas closure. We find that <0.01% of the quantity and value of commercial fish taxa are obtained from catch taken exclusively in the high seas, and if the catch of straddling taxa increases by 18% on average following closure because of spillover, there would be no loss in global catch. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, would decrease from 0.66 to 0.33.

Here, we forecast the potential northward progression of 515 fish species following climate change, and report the rate of potential species interchange between the Atlantic and the Pacific via the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage. For this, we projected niche-based models under climate change scenarios and simulated the spread of species through the passages when climatic conditions became suitable. Results reveal a complex range of responses during this century, and accelerated interchange after 2050. By 2100 up to 41 species could enter the Pacific and 44 species could enter the Atlantic, via one or both passages.

An important emerging regulatory framework on environmental sustainability for business operations is the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 (IFC PS6). Within PS6, identification of biodiversity significance is articulated through the concept of “Critical Habitat”, a definition developed by the IFC and detailed through criteria aligned with those that support internationally accepted biodiversity designations. No publicly available tools have been developed in either the marine or terrestrial realm to assess the likelihood of sites or operations being located within PS6-defined Critical Habitat. This paper presents a starting point towards filling this gap in the form of a preliminary global map that classifies more than 13 million km<sup>2</sup> of marine and coastal areas of importance for biodiversity (protected areas, Key Biodiversity Areas [KBA], sea turtle nesting sites, cold- and warm-water corals, seamounts, seagrass beds, mangroves, saltmarshes, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps) based on their overlap with Critical Habitat criteria, as defined by IFC. In total, 5798×10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (1.6%) of the analysis area (global ocean plus coastal land strip) were classed as Likely Critical Habitat, and 7526×103 km2 (2.1%) as Potential Critical Habitat; the remainder (96.3%) were Unclassified. The latter was primarily due to the paucity of biodiversity data in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction and/or in deep waters, and the comparatively fewer protected areas and KBAs in these regions. Globally, protected areas constituted 65.9% of the combined Likely and Potential Critical Habitat extent, and KBAs 29.3%, not accounting for the overlap between these two features. Relative Critical Habitat extent in Exclusive Economic Zones varied dramatically between countries. This work is likely to be of particular use for industries operating in the marine and coastal realms as an early screening aid prior to in situ Critical Habitat assessment; to financial institutions making investment decisions; and to those wishing to implement good practice policies relevant to biodiversity management.

Our goal was to identify, from the areas visited by the albatrosses, which coastal states share responsibility in regulating industrial fishing in their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in order to promote the preservation of this species. Using stage-relevant tracking techniques (satellite tags, GPS and GLS loggers), we surveyed 361 at-sea trips by 93 individuals over 9 yr, covering incubation, brooding, chick-rearing, sabbatical, failed-breeding, juvenile and immature stages. Our data show that Amsterdam albatrosses exhibit a wide and variable foraging radius (from 326 ± 193 km during brooding to 5519 ± 766 km for immatures) and at-sea distribution across stages, putting them beyond the French EEZ of Amsterdam Island for all or part of the trips surveyed in each stage, and even outside the Indian Ocean when breeding. In all, the breeding versus non-breeding albatrosses visited the EEZs of 1 to 3 versus 3 to 4 countries, respectively. Only breeders visited the&nbsp; EEZs of Madagascar and Mauritius, while only non-breeders visited the EEZs of Australia, South Africa and Namibia.

We used satellite telemetry and a switching state-space model to identify distinct foraging areas used by 59 NGoM loggerheads tagged during 2010–2013. We tagged turtles after nesting at three sites, 1 in Alabama (Gulf Shores; n = 37) and 2 in Florida (St. Joseph Peninsula; n = 20 and Eglin Air Force Base; n = 2). Peak migration time was 22 July to 9 August during which &gt;40% of turtles were in migration mode; the mean post-nesting migration period was 23.0 d (±13.8 d SD). After displacement from nesting beaches, 44 turtles traveled to foraging sites where they remained resident throughout tracking durations. Selected foraging locations were variable distances from tagging sites, and in 5 geographic regions; no turtles selected foraging sites outside the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Foraging sites delineated using 50% kernel density estimation were located a mean distance of 47.6 km from land and in water with mean depth of -32.5 m; other foraging sites, delineated using minimum convex polygons, were located a mean distance of 43.0 km from land and in water with a mean depth of -24.9 m.

These varied responses may be partly explained by the decade-old recognition that within-system spatial heterogeneity in key climate and anthropogenic drivers may be important, as recent theoretical examinations have concluded that spatial heterogeneity in environmental characteristics may diminish the tendency for regime shifts. Here, we synthesize recent, empirical within-system spatio-temporal analyses of some temperate and subarctic large marine ecosystems  in which regime shifts have (and have not) occurred. Examples from the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Bengula Current, North Sea, Barents Sea and Eastern Scotian Shelf reveal the largely neglected importance of considering spatial variability in key biotic and abiotic influences and species movements in the context of evaluating and predicting regime shifts.We highlight both the importance of understanding the scale-dependent spatial dynamics of climate influences and key predator–prey interactions to unravel the dynamics of regime shifts, and the utility of spatial downscaling of proposed mechanisms (as evident in the North Sea and Barents Sea) as a means of evaluating hypotheses originally derived from among-system comparisons.

Only after the formal approval of the protocol by the European Council in December 2013, some eastern EU member states started sending their pelagic trawlers back to Mauritania. This resulted in a utilisation of the protocol of 54% for the whole of 2013. Although the EU repeatedly stated that the €70 million/yr paid under the protocol provided good value for money, this assertion was hard to maintain considering the limited utilisation of the agreement. The paper analyses why the EU concluded an agreement with Mauritania that was not wanted by their industry and that was therefore only partially used in the end. It describes the decision making process inside the EU; the different parties involved and their different objectives. It is concluded that the EU decision making process suffers from a lack of transparency and that the combination of a business agreement with development aid resulted in an agreement which did not attain either of the stated objectives.

Mapping and estimating national green GDPs is a challenging task. In this study, we estimated the global market and non-market monetary values using two images, GlobCover 2009 and nighttime satellite imagery, as well as a comprehensive dataset. We also developed an integrated method supported by geographic information system (GIS) techniques, focused on spatial heterogeneity and real value, to create synthetic green GDP maps at global and national scales. Our results show that in 2009, for the entire biosphere, the ecosystem services value (ESV) could be estimated at US$ 149.61 trillion. Approximately 75.15% of the ESV is contributed by marine systems. The world GDP in 2009 was about US$ 71.75 trillion (for 225 countries or regions), resulting in a ratio of total ESV to GDP of approximately 2.09–1. Nighttime satellite imagery represents a more spatially explicit indicator of market value than does GDP. We also found that the distribution of the synthetic national green GDPs follows Zipf's Law, which holds that internal coherence exists among countries. A crude but simple indicator of the %ESV indicates that the relationship between the GDP and ESV is not always in a fixed pattern. The reliability of this result was demonstrated by comparing it with previous research and other relevant indices. We found a very high degree of confidence associated with this product. The method presented here is generally applicable at the global and continental scales and is applicable at the national scale for mapping the ESV and GDP. We hope that the results of this study will inform both policy-makers and the public about national green GDPs and encourage them to incorporate these values into policy decisions.","Li, G.; Fang, C.",WOS:000342656100032,"Li, Guangdong, G.",,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.05.020,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""Marine Regions acknowledged""",,,Geographic information systems,,Ecosystem services values; Ecosystem services mapping;   Green GDP accounting; Value transfer; DMSP/OLS nighttime light ,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",Peoples R China,Ecosystem services values; Ecosystem services mapping; Green GDP accounting; Value transfer; DMSP/OLS nighttime light; Geographic information system,NIGHTTIME SATELLITE IMAGERY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; ZIPFS LAW; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY; LAND-COVER; CHINA; VALUATION; CITIES; POPULATION,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Chinese Academy of Sciences - Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res,x,,,,

Here we develop a method for creating watch lists using the consistent predictors of invasion success—history of invasion, environmental suitability, and propagule pressure (measured respectively using the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), environmental modelling, and tourism and trade data). We tested the approach for South Africa, at a national level for various taxa and at a provincial level for plants. Of 884 alien species listed in the GISD, 400 were potential invaders, with most occurring in high risk regions. When alien species in South Africa were evaluated there were many false-negatives (sensitivity of 32% for terrestrial and 40% for marine species), because the GISD is not comprehensive, but few false positives (specificity of 91% for terrestrial and 89% for marine species). The methodology was easy to apply at different political levels, but we found substantial overlaps between the national and provincial watch lists of plants. This simple technique is rapid, easily repeatable, flexible, transparent, works across taxa, and does not require substantial financial or scientific input. It can be used in any region of the world and at various political levels as an initial assessment of key threats.

In this article, we propose a well-defined coastline in a structured GIS format that complies with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) ocean and sea definitions. Once this line structure has been defined and digitized to an agreed accuracy, it may be used as a building block—for example, for matching river mouths and country borders to the coastline—and for additional functions such as creating a hydrographic coding system. A coding mechanism has been developed based on available mathematical formulas, which enables the rapid computation of similar codes based on any high-quality geometric data. An application of the system is demonstrated in order to assess how grouping and ordering data along a coastline may be explored.

The Gulf of Mexico was divided into four geographic regions and six depth classes; ß-diversity between the 24 polygons was calculated with the Sørensen similarity index and analyzed using a cluster analysis and an ordination based on non-metric multidimensional scaling. Both analyses revealed a strong influence of depth on the polychaete assemblages. The polychaete fauna in the southeastern sector was the most distinctive among the four sectors. Each of the 835 polychaete species and subspecies was assigned to a class in the categories “mobility,” “feeding strategy,” and “feeding appendage” and the compositions of the categories throughout different depths were examined. The categories introduced by Fauchald and Jumars (Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev 17:193–284, 1979) were amended and the suggested changes discussed. Each species was assigned to a biogeographical class based on their worldwide distributions. Ten percent of the polychaete species were endemic to the Gulf of Mexico. More than 40 % of the species were exclusively found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, about one-third of the polychaetes had a wide distribution, and 15 % of all species were restricted to both coasts of the American continent.

Universiteit Gent: Gent. 62, vi-xvi pp.","This work assessed the state of our knowledge on marine biodiversity globally based on the world's largest biogeographic database, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). OBIS contains 112,514 distinct marine species mainly originating from three major taxonomic groups: Crustacea, Mollusca, and Pisces. These three groups represent more than half of all data in OBIS, resulting in a high incompleteness of other taxonomic groups. Different oceanic regions show the same pattern: the same three groups were highly represented. Taxonomic gaps remain for other groups. Also in terms of depth, and geographical coverage gaps were found. Large parts of the open ocean are under sampled and do not represent a similar apparent species richness as other open ocean regions with higher sampling effort and completeness. The Chao2 species richness allowed the assessment of the completeness of OBIS data. Coastal areas mostly deliver reliable estimators, but the completeness stays low. These results can provide baselines for future assessments such as the World Ocean Assessment of the United Nations and can guide policy makers in setting priorities towards enhancing our knowledgebase by targeting gaps in taxonomy, ocean depth, and geographical coverage.The OBIS database also provided insights in species distribution changes. A poleward shift was detected with a narrowing range for tropical and temperate species. However, first results showed that polar shifted on average a movement towards the equator and an expanding range. Still, only the range for tropical species differed greatly, where a clear shift away from the equator was seen.","Dujardin, F.",,"Dujardin, Frédéric, F.","Ghent University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology",,,"EUROBIS ackn - indirect use, ""European Oceanographic Biogeographic Information System (EurOBIS) acknowledged"", ""LifeWatch Species Information Backbone""",,,,,,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department,,Belgium,x,University,Science

The Stygiomysida (2 families, 2 genera, 16 species), however, are found primarily in subterranean waters, but always in waters with a marine influence. The Mysida and Stygiomysida body is divided into three main regions: cephalon, thorax, and abdomen. They are shrimp-like in appearance, containing morphological features earlier referred to as defining a ""caridoid facies"". The shrimp-like morphology was to some extent diagnostic for the historic Decapod taxon Schizopoda, containing the Nebalia, Mysida, Lophogastrida, and Euphausiacea. In 1904 the concept of Schizopoda was abandoned, and the Mysidacea (Mysida and Lophogastrida) along with Cumacea, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Tanaidacea were placed in a new taxon, the Peracarida. Later discoveries of groundwater mysids led to the establishment of Stygiomysida, but placement to either Lophogastrida or Mysida remained unclear. The presence of oostegites and absence of podobranchiae, coupled with non-statocyst bearing uropods have been used to classify the Stygiomysida as a primitive Mysida family, comparable to Petalophthalmidae. On the other hand, equally suggestive characters, but for a Lophogastrida affiliation, was suggested for the archaic foregut characters and again, non-statocyst bearing uropods. With the inclusion of DNA sequence data of ribosomal genes, sister group relationships between Stygiomysida, Lophogastrida, and Mictacea within the Peracarida are observed, which supports a classification of the Stygiomysida as a separate order removed from the Mysida.","Meland, K.; Mees, J.; Porter, M.; Wittmann, K.J.",WOS:000353713100042,"Mees, Jan, J.",Ghent University,http://hdl.handle.net/10.1371/journal.pone.0124656,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Mysida, ""Stygiomysida""","Reviews, ""Taxonomy""",,SARS    Phylogenetics    Somites    Abdomen    Habitats    Thorax    Fossil record    Fossils  Stygiomysida,"Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway.",Norway,,STATOLITHS CRUSTACEA; LOPHOGASTRIDA; MALACOSTRACA; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCES; RECORDS; FAUNA; SEA,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Ghent University,,Belgium,x,University,Science

We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk—extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models—for modern genera in these groups.

The family Holothuriidae has been increasingly studied in search for these compounds. With many species awaiting recognition and formal description this family currently consists of five genera and the systematics at the species-level taxonomy is, however, not yet fully understood. We provide a bibliographic review of the triterpene glycosides that has been reported within the Holothuriidae and analyzed the relationship of certain compounds with the presence of Cuvierian tubules. We found 40 species belonging to four genera and 121 compounds. Holothurin A and B are the most common saponins for <i>Actinopyga</i>, <i>Holothuria</i>, and <i>Pearsonothuria</i>. The genus <i>Bohadschia</i> presents mainly bivittoside C and D. <i>Actinopyga</i> has only sulfated saponins mainly oxidized, <i>Bohadschia</i> non-sulfated ones mainly non-oxidized, <i>Holothuria</i> and <i>Pearsonothuria</i> contain both types of compounds, mainly oxidized. Within the genus <i>Holothuria</i>, the subgenus <i>Panningothuria</i> only has non-sulfated saponins. The presence of sulfated and non-sulfated compounds seemingly relates to the expellability or the absence of Cuvierian tubules and the temporal or permanent concealing habits of the species. Our study concludes that better insights into the systematic distribution of saponins in Holothuriidae will only be possible if the identifications of the investigated species are confirmed by a taxonomist, especially in this group wherein cryptic species and variation between life-history stages are common and yet poorly understood. Understanding of saponin distribution within the Holothuriidae would also benefit from a stabilization of triterpene glycoside nomenclature.","Honey-Escandon, M; Arreguin-Espinosa, R; Solis-Marin, A; Samyn, Y.",WOS:000348089300003,"Honey-Escandon, M","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Biomacromol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.09.007,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Actinopyga, ""Bohadschia"", ""Holothuria"", ""Holothuriidae"", ""Panningothuria"", ""Pearsonothuria""",,,Cuvierian tubules; Saponins; Taxonomy; family Holothuriidae,"Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Biomacromol, Circuit Exterior S-N,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",Mexico,Cuvierian tubules; Saponins; Taxonomy; family Holothuriidae,MARINE NATURAL-PRODUCTS; ACTINOPYGA-ECHINITES; BIVITTOSIDE-D; ECHINOSIDE-B; DS-ECHINOSIDE; OLIGOGLYCOSIDES; SAPONINS; ARGUSIDE; CANCER; 24-DEHYDROECHINOSIDE,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Zoology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Zoology,National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM),,Mexico,,University,Science

Ecosystem management needs to ensure a sustainable exploitation of marine resources as well as the protection of sensitive habitats, taking account of potential multiple-use conflicts and impacts over large spatial scales. The urgent need for large-scale spatial data on benthic species and communities resulted in an increasing application of distribution modelling (DM). The use of DM techniques enables to employ full spatial coverage data of environmental variables to predict benthic spatial distribution patterns. Especially, statistical DMs have opened new possibilities for ecosystem management applications, since they are straightforward and the outputs are easy to interpret and communicate. Mechanistic modelling techniques, targeting the fundamental niche of species, and Bayesian belief networks are the most promising to further improve DM performance in the marine realm. There are many actual and potential management applications of DMs in the marine benthic environment, these are (i) early warning systems for species invasion and pest control, (ii) to assess distribution probabilities of species to be protected, (iii) uses in monitoring design and spatial management frameworks (e.g. MPA designations), and (iv) establishing long-term ecosystem management measures (accounting for future climate-driven changes in the ecosystem). It is important to acknowledge also the limitations associated with DM applications in a marine management context as well as considering new areas for future DM developments. The knowledge of explanatory variables, for example, setting the basis for DM, will continue to be further developed: this includes both the abiotic (natural and anthropogenic) and the more pressing biotic (e.g. species interactions) aspects of the ecosystem. While the response variables on the other hand are often focused on species presence and some work undertaken on species abundances, it is equally important to consider, e.g. biological traits or benthic ecosystem functions in DM applications. Tools such as DMs are suitable to forecast the possible effects of climate change on benthic species distribution patterns and hence could help to steer present-day ecosystem management.","Reiss, H; Birchenough, S; Borja, A; Buhl-Mortensen, L; Craeymeersch, J; Dannheim, J; Darr, A; Galparsoro, I; Gogina, M; Neumann, H; Populus, J; Rengstorf, M; Valle, M; van Hoey, G.; Zettler, L; Degraer, S.",WOS:000350154300002,"Galparsoro, I","AZTI Tecnalia, Div Marine Res, Pasaia 20110, Spain.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsu107,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,,,,ecosystem approach; environmental monitoring; habitat suitabilitymodelling; macrofauna; mapping; marine spatial planning (MSP);predictive modelling; species distribution modelling,,,,,,,Tecnalia - AZTI - Marine Research Division,x,,,,

The latter indicates that geographic shifts in the distribution of coastal species as a result of global warming can possibly be mitigated by changes in the depth profile at which these species occur. <i>Mesophyllum expansum</i>, an important builder of Mediterranean coralligenous habitats, may be a good target species to assess its response to climate change.","Peña, V.; De Clerck, O.; Afonso-Carrillo, J; Ballesteros, E; Barbara, I; Barreiro, R; Le Gall, L",WOS:000349385600002,"Peña, Viviana, V.","Phycology Research Group, Ghent University",https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2014.981294,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,"Mesophyllum, ""Mesophyllum alternans"", ""Mesophyllum expansum"", ""Mesophyllum lichenoides"", ""Mesophyllum macroblastum"", ""Mesophyllum sphaericum""",,,biodiversity; climate change; coralligenous; crustose coralline algae;distribution; DNA barcoding; maerl; Mediterranean; NE Atlantic;systematics,,,,,,,Ghent University - Faculty of Sciences - Biology Department - Research Group Phycology,,Belgium,x,Research institute,Science

Acoustic propagation measurements have been used to monitor primary production over broad spatial scales (10<sup>1</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> m) in seagrass meadows, and work is in development to assess the application of acoustics for measuring aggregate production in kelp beds and forests. In addition, scientific echosounders have been used routinely for mapping these benthic habitats and, in some cases, identify dominant species. Further advances in these areas require the development of species-specific acoustic models. However there is little knowledge of the acoustic properties of macroalgae, in part because measuring sound speed in large macroalgae is challenging due to their complex morphology. In this study four different methods are developed and trialled to determine the intrinsic sound speed of <i>Ecklonia radiata</i> tissue based on measurement of the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse, while compressibility is calculated from density measurements. Direct methods involved lengths of stipe and tightly packed stacks of macroalgae blade tissue. Indirect methods focused on an entire intact macroalga submerged in seawater, and a homogenate solution containing seawater and blended blade tissue. Blade tissue showed a density contrast (relative to seawater) of 1.23 and a sound speed contrast of 1.0374 for the stacks. The homogenate solution gave a sound speed contrast of 1.0424. Stipe tissue density and sound speed were lower. Density contrast was 1.04 and sound speed contrasts were 1.0179 (SD = 0.0025) and 1.0064 (SD = 0.0032) depending on the sample. Whole macroalgae had age- and size-dependent densities with an average density contrast of 1.11 (SD = 0.09) and showed an average sound speed of 1572.8 m/s (17.8 °C) and contrast of 1.0404 (SD = 0.0139). Compressibility was higher in stipe than blade tissue, with 3.924e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> and 3.982e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> for stipes and 3.209e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> and 3.180e-10 Pa<sup>- 1</sup> for blade in stacks and homogenate respectively. The results show that <i>E. radiata</i> sound speed and density are higher, and compressibility lower, than that of seawater. This is likely related to high concentrations of alginate, and other structural and storage carbohydrates in the macroalgae, and thus may vary seasonally. The differences between tissue types found for all properties reflect the morphology and anatomy of this macroalga, with tightly condensed chloroplast cells in blade tissue and loosely packed structural cells in the stipe. This research provides essential input parameters to numerical models that will enhance acoustic habitat mapping and allow the development of acoustic inverse methods. This may enable the estimation of aggregate primary production over large spatial scales in temperate kelp habitats, thus informing their future management.","Randall, J.; Hermand, J.-P.; Ernould, M.-E.; Ross, J; Johnson, C",WOS:000346894900052,"Randall, Jo, J.","Environmental Hydroacoustics Laboratory, Université libre de Bruxelles",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.09.013,,"Bio-ORACLE, ""Lifewatch acknowledged""",,Ecklonia radiata,,,Compressibility; Density; Ecklonia radiata; Seaweed; Sound speed;Ultrasound,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such movements are also associated with the introduction of non-native species via hitchhiking individual organisms. The oyster industry, one of the most important forms of marine aquaculture, embodies these issues. In Europe disease outbreaks affecting cultivated populations of the naturalized oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> caused a major disruption of production in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mitigation procedures involved massive imports of stock from the species’ native range in the northwestern Pacific from 1971 to 1977. We assessed the role stock imports played in the introduction of non-native marine species (including pathogens) from the northwestern Pacific to Europe through a methodological and critical appraisal of record data. The discovery rate of non-native species (a proxy for the introduction rate) from 1966 to 2012 suggests a continuous vector activity over the entire period. Disease outbreaks that have been affecting oyster production since 2008 may be a result of imports from the northwestern Pacific, and such imports are again being considered as an answer to the crisis. Although successful as a remedy in the short and medium terms, such translocations may bring new diseases that may trigger yet more imports (self-reinforcing or positive feedback loop) and lead to the introduction of more hitchhikers. Although there is a legal framework to prevent or reduce these introductions, existing procedures should be improved.","Mineur, F.; Le Roux, A; Maggs, A; Verlaque, M",WOS:000344794200024,"Mineur, Frédéric, F.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Global Food Secur, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12363,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,Crassostrea gigas,,,biological invasions; hitchhikers; mollusc diseases; non-indigenousspecies; OsHV-1; oyster farming; pathways; vectors; cultivo de ostras;enfermedades de moluscos; especies no-nativas; invasiones biologicas;OsHV-1; pasajeros; senderos; vectores,"Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Global Food Secur, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",North Ireland,biological invasions; hitchhikers; mollusc diseases; non-indigenous species; OsHV-1; oyster farming; pathways; vectors; cultivo de ostras; enfermedades de moluscos; especies no-nativas; invasiones biologicas; OsHV-1; pasajeros; senderos; vectores,CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS THUNBERG; PACIFIC OYSTER; INVASION PATTERNS; VECTOR; SPREAD; POPULATION; INFECTION; DISEASE; FRANCE,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Queen's University of Belfast (QUB),,UK,,University,Science

We generated 27 new sequences of SSU rDNA belonging to five genera not previously sequenced, and 34 new sequences of COI belonging to six genera and four families not previously sequenced. The SSU rDNA tree confirmed the Enoplida to be a monophyletic sister group to the Chromadorida. The family Comesomatidae is a sister group of the Xyalidae within the Monhysterida. Both DNA markers confirmed the congruence between the morphology- and molecular-based phylogenetic inferences for most of the families. Desmodoridae was a monophyletic group, but the relationships within the family could not be recovered; the subfamilies Desmodorinae and Spiriniinae were not monophyletic meanwhile the monophyly of Stilbonematinae was not fully supported due to a few specimens of questionable identity. COI performed better than SSU rDNA to disentangle relationships among closely related species and suggested the presence of cryptic diversity within Desmodoridae. COI is effective to explore cryptic diversity and barcode species within Nematoda, with a possible threshold of genetic distance of 5% between conspecific and interspecific sequences, but DNA barcoding is limited by the poor knowledge of the diversity and taxonomy of the group and the lack of a good reference database of vouchered COI sequences.","Armenteros, M; Rojas-Corzo, A; Ruiz-Abierno, A; Derycke, S.; Backeljau, T.; Decraemer, W.",WOS:000343077100010,"Decraemer, Wilfrida, W.",Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences,https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-00002824,,"LifeWatch Species Information Backbone, ""World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) acknowledged"", ""WoRMS ackn - direct reference""",,"Chromadorea, ""Comesomatidae"", ""Desmodoridae Filipjev, 1922"", ""Enoplea"", ""Monhysterida"", ""Nematoda"", ""Spiriniinae"", ""Stilbonematinae"", ""Xyalidae""",,,18S rDNA; Chromadorea; Enoplea; molecular; phylogeny; taxonomy,"Univ La Habana, Ctr Invest Marinas, Playa 11300, Habana, Cuba.",Cuba,18S rDNA; Chromadorea; Enoplea; molecular; phylogeny; taxonomy,POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; HIGHER-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION; ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY; MORPHOLOGY; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION,Zoology,Zoology,RBINS Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS),,,,,

Molecular phylogenetics recently revealed that they are not members of the externally similar yet phylogenetically derived Pyramidellidae, but instead potentially one of the oldest clades among the heterobranch Gastropoda. Furthermore, current data surprisingly indicate a sister-group relationship with Rhodopemorpha, highly aberrant marine slugs with previously unclear affinities. Murchisonellidae are characterized by a specialized pincer-like radula, but very little further data exist on soft-body anatomy for most species, and there are only a few observations of living animals. Investigation of the anatomy of Murchisonellidae may thus yield new data providing insights into early heterobranch evolution and that of enigmatic Rhodopemorpha. We collected live specimens of the murchisonellid Koloonella cf. minutissima ( Laseron, 1951), a member of a genus known mainly from eastern Australia. We provide detailed live photographs and interactive 3D data on all major organ systems, based on serial histological sections. The mantle cavity is shown to contain several distinct glands, a pair of which is conspicuously similar to glands found in Rhodopemorpha. The anterior digestive system contains a unique four-toothed radula, a feeble pharynx and a special, vacuolated oesophageal bulb. The reproductive system is complex and diaulic, and contains unusual structures. These results highlight structural diversity among minute lower Heterobranchia. Soft-body characters do not contradict, and may even support, the counterintuitive sister-group relationship with shell-less, wormshaped Rhodopemorpha. The classification of Murchisonellidae is discussed and a revised scheme is proposed.

Some of this variation appears to be correlated with geographic range, with four regional colour forms having been recognized. However, the identity of P. alabe has been unclear because of its vague original description, based on only two specimens from Baja Califonia, Mexico, without any morphological or molecular study to date. Here we present a complete redescription, based on examination of the holotype and paratype, as well as study of new material from the type locality and vicinity. The description includes colour pictures, drawings of the reproductive system and electron micrographs of the radula and penis. New findings are reported, such as the presence of two well-developed cusps in the outer lateral teeth, a pair of digitiform and rather short salivary glands, and a penis with at least two different types of penial spines. We describe the reproductive system for the first time. Specimens similar to P. alabe in the external coloration, but with several external and internal differences such as the type of salivary glands and number of outermost teeth, are described as a new species, P. anae n. sp. from Panama and Costa Rica. These two species are compared with five other Polycera species known from the eastern Pacific.

Members of the suborder Euthecosomata are either torted snails with a coiled, sinistral shell (Limacinidae) or are straight-shelled with a symmetrical body and an unusual ventral mantle cavity (Orthoconcha). The classification and taxonomy of euthecosomes still depends on shells, but is being challenged by initial molecular data. There is a large body of morphoanatomical information dating from the beginning of the last century, and only biological (rather than soft-part anatomical) detail has been added since. For our initial study on pteropod morphoanatomy we have selected the potentially basal orthoconch genus Creseis Rang, 1828. Supplementing Meisenheimer's (1905) monographic work, we redescribe the microanatomy of the Mediterranean C. clava (Rang, 1828) from serial semithin sections and present 3D-models of all major organ systems. In the absence of histological differences we interpret the head to be fused with the foot, forming the wings with reduced labial tentacles and rhinophores. The postpharyngeal nerve ring is strongly condensed, showing fused buccal ganglia and a short visceral loop with two discernable ganglia. The genital system is monaulic and hermaphroditic, with female glands and a potential allosperm receptacle of unclear homology. An open seminal groove connects with the frontal copulatory organ, which shows complex penial infoldings. We confirm the 180° longitudinal rotation of the visceral organs relative to the condition in limacinids. As an alternative to ontogenetic detorsion, progenesis may have skipped torsion. Other obvious paedomorphoses such as single, basally forked tentacular nerves, suggest that heterochrony has been a driving force in thecosome evolution. Retaining the mantle cavity in a ventral position, Creseis has its large mantle gland—necessary for creating a mucus web for feeding—close to the mouth. Further comparative microanatomical data on orthoconchs and limacinids are needed to corroborate our assumptions of homology, and for reconstructing pteropod evolution once reliable molecular phylogenetic hypotheses are available.
