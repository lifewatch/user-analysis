# Analysis of the [LifeWatch](https://lifewatch.be) users

LifeWatch users are considered:
1. The authors of LifeWatch publications,
2. The users of the LW data systems.


### 1. LifeWatch publications
The LifeWatch publications constitute a manually curated collection of scientific literature that is linked to the LifeWatch project. 
The collection consists of 11 LifeWatch special collections, which are subcollections that contain scientific articles (both peer and non-peer reviewed) and monographs (books, rapports, proceedings and abstracts, theses).

The LifeWatch special collections are: 
- EurOBIS ackn
- EUROBIS ackn – direct,
- EUROBIS ackn – indirect
- IRMNG ackn
- Lifewatch ackn
- LifeWatch Marine Data Archeology
- LifeWatch Observatory
- LifeWatch Species Information Backbone
- Marine Regions ackn
- WoRMS ackn
- WoRMS ackn - direct
- LifeWatch available through INBO IPT

The (non-standardized) publications are available here: [LW_publications](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/LW_publications/ReadMe.md)

### 2. LifeWatch data systems
The LifeWatch data systems are the services and products offered by LifeWatch.
For this user analysis, following LifeWatch data systems were taken into account: 
- [Marine Regions](https://marineregions.org)
- [WoRMS](https://marinespecies.org)
- data requests (via mail)
- mailing lists
- registered users
- workshop participants 

The Data on the users of data systems is available here: [LW_data_systems](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/LW_data_systems/ReadMe.md)



This repository further contains a python module to standardize the information of the LifeWatch publications: [standardize_publications](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/LW_publications/ReadMe.md)
This python module makes use of an export of the LifeWatch publications from WebOfScience (here: [wos_export](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/wos_export/ReadMe.md)) and produces a csv file with the standardized information (here: [LW_publications_standardized](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/LW_publications_standardized/ReadMe.md)). 

And finally, also jupyter notebooks with various user analysis statistics: [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/lifewatch/user-analysis/notebooks/ReadMe.md).
