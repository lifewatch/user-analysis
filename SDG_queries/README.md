# Assigning labels based on SDGs and EBVs

This directory contains a Script to assign predefined (term searches) queries,
based on the title, abstract and term fields of each publication.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) queries are based on the queries from
the Elsevier 2021 SDG mapping.

> queries to identify research that supports the United Nations Sustainable
> Development Goals (SDGs) 2021”, Mendeley Data, V4, doi: 10.17632/9sxdykm8s4.4

The Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) are also inspired by the Elsevier queries, but are based
on the EBV Classes and description (https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/):
